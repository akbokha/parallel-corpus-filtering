although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordinarily great .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , listened to American music , read American authors and run his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly a journalist because of an American movie .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate , who wanted to occupy the supreme federal court with judges who were inclined to his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was as if this is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona had only reinforced my admir@@ ation for the United States .
I always said , &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it &apos;s easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even had written a very black@@ ish love letter about his great@@ ness .
then came Donald Tru@@ mp .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how to deal with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
he never stops in his opinion on the mountain , as you say so nicely .
he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague expressed it , and publicly declares his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , the people have responded to his statements and tuned in pairs for him .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can pres@@ election was the highest number ever achieved by the party nom@@ in@@ ee .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ?
I couldn &apos;t reconci@@ le Tru@@ mp and his elec@@ tors with the people I met in Phoenix during my time .
like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , which takes people from all over the world , a deeply believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
also , Tru@@ mp@@ s Welt@@ anschau@@ ung did not agree with the present editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati Inqu@@ ir@@ er , &quot; the present editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati Inqu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fought for the environment for a long time , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
she still fits the engagement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Leck@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wis@@ er advice helped me a lot during my career .
these people and the values represented by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tru@@ mp broke his way to the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , she offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
it turned out , however , that they were the exception of the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly wh@@ ites , the pres@@ idency , gave a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp because they shared their racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tru@@ mp voters as Ras@@ si@@ sts .
to classi@@ fy people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superficial and respect@@ ful , and indicates an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , most of whom have voted for Tru@@ mp , because they want to regain control of a country they have disappointed ?
in other words , they might say they are still important in America ?
perhaps .
however , you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comm@@ its the cruel decision to raise a man looking down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look different than he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( O@@ B . : as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; referring to the wh@@ ites against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; word play in white in all@@ usion to the Wh@@ ites and Whi@@ plas@@ h , which means so much like Sch@@ leu@@ der@@ trauma ) , as the big Van Jones described , has killed exactly what America has made so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world value the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - what faith or background one may have , America is welcome everyone .
for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ an@@ ist , whose story as he himself says nowhere else in the world would be possible .
with the election of Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s , however , a huge part of America &apos;s white America promises this promise and says : to Hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say .
in all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a rally for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ro@@ ared the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have Lat@@ inos a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried , and their voices became lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would anyone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tru@@ mp , that is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land for which his son was fallen , sent him a message .
this is Tru@@ mp@@ s Land now , the message said .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan might find no place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

from misery to the stars : these Latin American children don &apos;t want to spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish
the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .
picture of Fli@@ ck@@ r user OE@@ A @-@ O@@ AS ( CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 ) .
what did the Mexican Music School of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the O@@ ax@@ aca province share with the children of the Paragu@@ a@@ ean city of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
the fact that the music played at both places has not only changed the lives of children , but also a very close connection with ...
music , which lives with the tr@@ ash
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca and # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town which is very popular among tourists - but worlds away from the nearby pre@@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for several years now , the La b@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music gang ) plays in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , located in one of Mexico &apos;s poor@@ est provinces , is known for its drug abuse and gangs violence .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot , who launched a musical project and offered a rare hope for the youth .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , the local press No@@ tici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI writes :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they come always laugh@@ ing and with shiny eyes and play in the h@@ ust@@ le you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , Pic@@ colo , clarinet , o@@ bo@@ e , flute , Wald@@ horn , Pau@@ line , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from Wa@@ ste
the children of C@@ ate@@ ura play more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero - a village that is practically on the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ processed instruments made of local solid waste materials produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers began to convert pieces of waste into instruments under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez .
the instruments mim@@ ic violin , viol@@ a , cel@@ los , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion , all made of the tr@@ ash .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and musical teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the early days :
at first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage . the children didn &apos;t know any music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something he had never seen before : a violin produced from waste .
today there is a whole orchestra that plays instruments from re@@ processed material and called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentation called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic MÃ¼ll@@ er@@ pon@@ ie ) records the musical performance :
the world produces about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish every year .
those who live with Him and from Him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they transform it into something beautiful .
the Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played its music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries demonstrate how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practical solutions for environmental problems .
re @-@ publishing takes place as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
back then in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already run illegal fishing in Liber@@ ian waters before it looked for the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a break@@ water of this species on their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ es , Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to launch one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rem@@ ember Bene@@ dict Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading employee of the Ken@@ yan F@@ ish@@ eries Authority . he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it was unable to catch fish there .
in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , because of lo@@ oting the fish stocks of the country .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and safegu@@ ards resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 founded by N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal fishing ( Il@@ legal F@@ ish@@ eries Stop ) .
in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries , who then had expelled the prime minister from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like minded and work together . they exchange information and stand together for illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust Project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project provides F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to detect . thus illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected can harm the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
however , while actions against illegal fishing were ham@@ pered by bureaucratic obstacles , and also through the sn@@ ail pace that circul@@ ated information between individual countries , the actions happen nowadays in real time , with tra@@ ck@@ able at F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about susp@@ icious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i also closely monitors the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data .
this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in prohibited areas . also , susp@@ icious routes may be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship loads the caught fish on the way to other ships .
in an ideal case , such investigations can show whether the involved ships have a fishing licence , where they were on the road and possibly also if they have a pen@@ al code .
countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such vessels in their ports , which means that ships cannot sell their cargo , and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about significant financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is not worthwhile financially . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , head of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the previously mentioned platform was created to recover an estimated 20 million USD in lost revenue , which are losing the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network every year because of the illegal fishermen that enter into East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish@@ eries , therefore the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also illegal fishermen .
among other things , actions include sailing under false flag , fake licence documents , specification of fanta@@ sies , fish protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non @-@ complete organized control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fishing illeg@@ ally and a country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t start my harbor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &apos; and exactly this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now .
until now the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of susp@@ icious ships .
it has uncovered criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used multiple frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has tra@@ cked and found escap@@ ing ships .
due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority for comb@@ ating crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share and preserve information on illegal fishing across great distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to locate susp@@ icious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , helps to detect the illegal ships that like to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use highly sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief Analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , a NGO that also deals with fisher@@ y data and provides technical support for F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , some of the ships switch off their automatic identification systems , so they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
Cop@@ eland helps build a system that combines different levels of information with each other . F@@ ISH @-@ i will help to find criminal @-@ acting ships with greater precision .
a model program
yet F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually influence the un@@ question@@ able global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the NGO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Marine Protection Organization Oc@@ e@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by means of the position of each tracking ship in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; join with the neighbours to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust has a similar project in which a global system allows the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities do not only detect criminals but also deter them .
ships that used to conf@@ isc@@ ate without licence and had hardly reck@@ oned with consequences , know now that they are being observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ ISH @-@ i have now reached a 33 % increase in fisher@@ y sales since fishing boats buy more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i had helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found tow@@ ing nets where they were banned .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that now also other countries are copying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars annually disappear by illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there , six countries joined forces in 2015 to go to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are now fighting illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safety is the goal of even more such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country Somalia was able to announce its first big triumph : in October , it made Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under a false flag . and not only was the ship traveling without a license and were used drag nets , which are now banned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also inv@@ aded into forbidden waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time proof that such a special , collaborative way of working for the protection of the oceans actually works in the entire world sea .

the road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the inauguration of the President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

after the government of Venezuela rejected the opposition &apos;s motion to a referendum on a referendum , Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the country &apos;s political and economic crisis ran into the void while gathered in the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( for example : the suppression of Venezuela ) , pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them can be found .
the debate is also being conducted in other parts of the country - including in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the Andes Mountains MÃ©@@ ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira , in the central @-@ north of the Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country deterior@@ ates continuously , which makes itself felt in the daily life of Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition saw in the inauguration of the current President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro the chance of a fundamental change ; in the end , however , the reluc@@ t@@ ance to re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , contribut@@ or to Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation and the rate of inflation are among the highest in the world ( inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) , and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine is the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Diam@@ r@@ Ã¡@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Un@@ ity ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together , called for a mass rally on the 27th of October , and a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government headquarters , was planned to continue to block the referendum on office .
the call was commented on Twitter , among other things , as follows :
it is so far Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday national strike and on November 3rd all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores palace .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the action programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , October 26 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the images of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen and supporters of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most commonly shared pictures shows a prot@@ esters who calls through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Venezu@@ el@@ an is scre@@ aming . &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter , pictures that tell of disputes , as well as reports of repression and mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
especially large waves struck the news about police repression in the centrally located town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the prot@@ esters moved back to the local cathedral to protect themselves according to their own testimony to the police and armed pro@@ pon@@ ents of the government .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State of T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira have no skir@@ ts , because otherwise one could see something that many nation @-@ gar@@ den@@ ers do not have !
meanwhile , an inf@@ ographic makes the round , which reflects the extent of repression per day :
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the demand for a term of office , which has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s added :
Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ dado testify that 1 % of the sig@@ natures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your office !
on the street !
others evaluate these protests as a further step in the fight against a government that has taken little against the disa@@ strous economic crisis and would rather have dealt with critical voices :
they took us so much - but also the fear !
mar@@ ches are increasing in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or shopping .

the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to take a look at the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine city of CÃ³rdoba .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now said in the course of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of CÃ³rdoba , against his father .
in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship were investigated .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he retained his family secrets .
in the situation at that time I thought it was fine .
I felt like a secret .
as a child with 15 years of age , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time , I could not see that my father was a th@@ ief , a tor@@ turer and a mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was Gen@@ dar@@ meri@@ e@@ beam@@ ter . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 in La Per@@ la prison .

&quot; &quot; &quot; they all called him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have become friends with one of the ERP .
don &apos;t take your passport for one day and I will have to save you .
the ac@@ ron@@ ym ERP stands for Ej@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party Argentina .
that is why he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would become a secret .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
at the military base I had to anni@@ hil@@ ate papers belonging to the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything .

&apos;@@ So the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me a total of four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance of the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small pack@@ et wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver in it .
on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks where the stolen objects were par@@ ked and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
then the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I pe@@ ened in and saw a couch that was tor@@ tured on men .
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they attached to it the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was lying there .
they in@@ sti@@ lled a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , cast him with water and ch@@ ased him a charge of 220 volts into the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ fic ... like a dirty di@@ aper .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I recognized the smell instantly and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I have never forgotten this od@@ our .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it possible for a person to do so much harm to another ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ i know that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were bound and tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people lay down with the face - all were tied to hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance people c@@ rou@@ ched on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father saw that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you see , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you kill me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit , and they were put to death by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me about it .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero put together a man there and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to survivors examined by the Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process , the student Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , head of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came in here is also the way where the kidn@@ apped came here .
when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then were tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above was to be laid .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War P@@ ute &apos;
my father brought home all sorts of stolen things .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at that time at the age I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war loo@@ t &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - as they called it - was . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but when I was in the military later , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war spo@@ ils are a bay@@ on@@ et , or perhaps military signs that one has fought against an enemy that has been fought .

but when one goes into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ table , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then that is not a war of war but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism .
I simply don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal , and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; And you , who drove cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded in anger , struck me and cried :
when you go so far , I will find you and kill you .
we don &apos;t need anybody else to do so !
thus was my Father .
I don &apos;t have a good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of back then , on which I wore a jacket and a roll @-@ collar @-@ pul@@ lover made of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothing home .
at that time , the defense accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can put me to the burden of what they wanted .
anyway , I was there to testify .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of the cor@@ p@@ ses is the last disgu@@ sting act &apos;
now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life .
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I went even so far to say :
well , you executed people during the dictatorship , but why would the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why are children kidn@@ apped ?
one day my father brought a girl with home , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I repeatedly asked myself : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
it would have been easy to put them in jail .
I guess it has just been decided to kill these people . but why do their bodies disappear ?
did these people not have families with whom to surrender their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of the cor@@ p@@ ses is the last disgu@@ sting act one can do to a man .
my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they fet@@ ched machines to eliminate the mort@@ al rem@@ nants of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed of anywhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my father said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but of course , something always remains .
&apos;@@ i &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I was even with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
the thought of displaying my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I accused him of all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience because of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have killed anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and wondered why all the exagger@@ ated patrio@@ tism and the &quot; Western and Christian sentim@@ ents &quot; they were supposed to defend were actually good .
then I cried :
how can you tell me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes , and you were forced to join me as a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , then show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 I made the first advertisement .
I had finally realized that he was a criminal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can reproach me that I am pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ ed . I &apos;ve finally said against my own father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest pending at the end of the trial .
he was charged for 4@@ 16 crimes : including severe , un@@ lawful priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture followed by death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years old .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the judgments in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera Process ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August .
43 op@@ press@@ ors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases the court sentenced to life imprisonment and in nine cases prison sentences between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of the 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ verdict : murder , torture and rape by officials . # Es@@ War@@ State terrorism
all the defend@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police officers and civilian employees .
Pier@@ o De Monti was kidn@@ apped with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the Swiss Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on justice for the victims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the advoc@@ ate of the Argent@@ ine@@ an organization of H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , representing the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the process took more than three years , but the research for this took 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that there could be a memorial that is now being led by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation mistake makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible car drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a center in Kyoto where one can pro@@ long its driver &apos;s license .
the photo was distributed in the social media .
review of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long his driving license , witnessed in the last month witnessed a particularly mis@@ successful translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a sign , the Japanese word , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older mot@@ ori@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; has been translated , wrong@@ ly - but perhaps also with malicious back than@@ king &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ ori@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from September 1st to 20th on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
edited by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which has been widely shared in the social media .
the mistake was the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a citizen Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also the one who made the local newspapers aware of it .
the Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n , which is published in Kyoto , wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the flaw@@ ed English translation was initially removed . the name &quot; H@@ art drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; terrible mot@@ ori@@ sts &quot; ) was later replaced by the more appropriate , albeit gram@@ mati@@ cally correct designation &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , it explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its correctness before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sorry that older people felt offen@@ ded by insufficient correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News was a little more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents at the national level is quite a concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , in 2005 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of 19.@@ 460 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , senior citizens caused 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
thus their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the share of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen in the same period .
in the article published on Yahoo , the name not mentioned in the article published comments to the light which show what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese ost@@ ensi@@ bly against older mot@@ ori@@ sts :
the article on Yahoo about translation errors has , among other things , the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is that ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dre@@ ad@@ ful mot@@ ori@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How bad is the translation actually not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that is a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not very few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre errors in English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
to translate , you need two important skills : passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and pro@@ active language skills to translate it into the target language .
the latter requires active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . in general , the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the source language - should be native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ English as a native language , which could make translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons or the relatively low number of English native speakers that learn Japanese .
some companies that do not have foreign employees can still make translations in @-@ house . then , the Japanese worker , whose English skills are evaluated as the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
automated translation is also widely used - often with funny results .
the conf@@ using and pu@@ zz@@ ling sentences , produced by mechanical translations , show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time . this applies to some languages quite special .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic im@@ prints , which often ad@@ orn t @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable as jewelry or at least harmless . but from large corporations or by government who have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for their translation .
Venezuela : taking protests and cens@@ orship on the internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the online broad@@ ca@@ ster Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later other users wrote that the internet presentations of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer available .
other online broad@@ cast@@ ers also recorded footage of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups that oppose the government Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros .
the protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court themselves .
Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was app@@ alled and recommended the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# Zen@@ sur : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are once again locked .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ant in reporting on protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I signed up at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again .
amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lem@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ in@@ filtr@@ at@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transm@@ its its sessions .
previous investigations by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS servers answer certain requests of certain domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server rep@@ lies faulty or refuse the request when calling such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the transmission was stopped on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera man El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live was captured .
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections , making the Venezu@@ el@@ ans access to multimedia coverage of the current events in the country more and more difficult .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive education
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today T@@ ina fights for the rights of children and collects testim@@ onies from other Cri@@ mean tas , which have been as victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a structural report published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en , &quot; which is edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices in Latin America .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one who has become something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a has never been treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . in Paraguay , the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money passes their under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another , rich family . in exchange , the child receives food , training and a roof over the head .
however , what is not mentioned here is that the children must pay for it countless days of house@@ work that can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted .
this practice called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay due to participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls .
she talked with Cri@@ mean tas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected witness testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to call things in the name , because the feeling of gratitude that cri@@ es the Cri@@ mes assures in general silence .
&quot; Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , the family , which their daughter finds in the belief that they complete their training , improve their position in society and &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; can go to another family .
on the other hand , the family who assimil@@ ates the girl and justi@@ fies its exploitation by faith means giving someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and perhaps even star@@ ved .
the Sac@@ ri@@ fice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will learn about it many years later .
sometimes they never experience it .
in January 2016 , the hitherto relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in seclu@@ sion in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , has a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n came to the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed signs of violent blows . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military officer Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ Ã­n was living with them in their home in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometres east of the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra joined Mar@@ Ã­n as long as she suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organisations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela were deeply involved in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an society &apos;s practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go &apos;s death for the death of the girl .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they described the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several dozen people came to protest demonstrations and demanded that there should be &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely spread in the social media .
&quot; more cows are registered in Paraguay as children , &quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compl@@ ained .
without papers it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbors of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for rapid investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was their Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be trend @-@ setting - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ mean tas are not only exploited as workers , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik , where her father worked , had to register and her father lost his work .
their brothers had to work all the way and started selling sweets on the street or on the market in order to earn money .
but they all went to school .
only T@@ ina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n as Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
in the home of her employer Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
she had to share her time in such a way that she still had time to learn .
she got up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employers .
Fri@@ days , for example , clean@@ sed the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn .
the sooner she finished learning , the more free time she had .
but even this time was limited because they had to have dinner for their employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve but also didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge , &quot; she re@@ members .
the library was well @-@ equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ is@@ ant of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party that was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
at some evenings the owner Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand beside him and read edi@@ t@@ orials from opposition magazines such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; he thought she was intelligent , but didn &apos;t stop with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the landlord had found someone to listen while he talked about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they didn &apos;t allow me often to visit my family because they thought that I would again &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad habits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , which belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ , would again speak their mother tongue Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her gent@@ lemen feared that they would lose the education they had made possible again , explained them .
but she was fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them , with her hard work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was also discrimin@@ ated in the school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a thing that is almost never spoken of is bul@@ lying and har@@ ass@@ ment exposed to Cri@@ mean when they go to school . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to come home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .

society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where job advertisements for cleaning staff and children &apos;s girls in Paraguay can be shared .
the Administr@@ ators of the Group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or in the district of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
Hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little girl for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
to learn .
please contact us .
starting Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad received five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the place Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a el@@ eventh @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman who also came from Ã@@ em@@ by offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the interior who wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the authors switched to the ad once more :
dear friends , I have found one . I &apos;ll see if it works with her .
thank you , I write again when something is .
the shop was closed .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue for the report Cri@@ adi@@ tas , Â¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ Ã¡n@@ do ?

in the course of our history , we have managed to aboli@@ sh systems such as slavery , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay ) , the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors , the con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the women of Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ ( where the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors had to pay tribute and Spanish in@@ doctr@@ ination ) and the system of Mens@@ Ãº ( where the workers had to pay tribute to them as a semi @-@ slave ) .
the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the show of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill introduced Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
picture of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , changed by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian MPs recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regulating the use and benefits of social networks &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it is accepted by the Parliament , users of social media in Egypt must register with a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be set up , which is in charge of granting citizens permission to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the adoption of the law , users must register on the site of the site with their proper names and ID numbers in order to be able to use social networks .
if it failed to do so , this could involve a sentence of up to six months imprisonment or a fine fine .
the bill that consists of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ ated in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent defines social media as &quot; any application that is running and used over the Internet to communicate with others by voice , video alignment and text . &quot;
it is not clear how the law will be enforced when it is accepted as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should impose the registration . it is unclear how they should make up those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ du@@ l Satt@@ ar , Par@@ liam@@ entary Assembly and suppor@@ ter of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a username and password from the Telec@@ ommunic@@ ation Ministry and blocked the Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt is planning to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of which it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information to their identity in order to access the network .
but it is not known so far that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; conducting research techn@@ ologist &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices :
I strongly doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they are forci@@ bly controlling physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online .
if I take them seriously , it means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who request permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a court process .
this is technically not realistic - but everything is possible in Egypt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it comes to the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its adoption and enforcement be successful or not , the draft is in line with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in the parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration on the image surface is present , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the MP , T@@ amer El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y , proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime in which a life @-@ long prison sentence was provided for those guilty of threatening the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; investing in protest . &quot;

high up in the mountains of the Kurdist@@ an region in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the veter@@ an H@@ ana Ah@@ med R@@ aza and her team of scientists of the Non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ards .
a sub@@ type of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which ro@@ ams through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus alto sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . they are endangered by Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they find less and less loo@@ t .
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depend on a large pre@@ dat@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore states that they have a record of a big cat in the camera , R@@ aza breaks out in sheer joy .
as a trained bi@@ ologist , R@@ aza passion@@ ately shows a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .

in the beginning of March 2017 , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , responsible for nor@@ theastern Japan , documented the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a huge earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an nuclear accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had caused the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its seat in Sen@@ dai , which is located in the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture was a popular pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast , which had to experience both the earthquake and ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring coun@@ ties of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forci@@ bly evacu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had caused entire coastal towns to disappear from the map .
even so , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had a nuclear accident , and that &apos;s why 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
from a local point of view , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o report shows what progress six years later have been achieved to rebuild the lives of local residents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the detailed report of the newspaper includes statistics from the Japanese re@@ building authority and survey results of those affected themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the housing situation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that by December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned sub@@ stitutes will be completed in the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to record the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , where 80 percent of the planned sub@@ stitutes were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light with 70 percent .
nevertheless , even six years after the catastrophe , evacu@@ ated by hab@@ itation shel@@ ters ( from the mas@@ h , kas@@ et@@ su Y@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) are still trying to settle into final sub@@ stitu@@ tions .
after the triple catastrophe almost 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , 36@@ 0,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate still lived in such dwell@@ ings .
almost 40 percent of the Ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ated families , who were hau@@ gh@@ ing after the disaster in shel@@ ters , were res@@ ett@@ led into final homes .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the number is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper could determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , which were affected by the mis@@ fortune , opened their doors by December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is much more difficult .
while almost 100 percent of fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 per cent of the fishing ports have res@@ um@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident , in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agr@@ arian country , have been heavily affected .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 per cent of the agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land can be used again in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 acres of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farm@@ land from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are located in the &quot; nuclear zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains well stri@@ cken here as well .
the number of tourists in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate is up to 90 percent on the same level as before the mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only have 75 percent here .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the disaster nearly half of the coastal people find it more difficult to earn their livel@@ ihood .
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
in order to determine an overall picture , the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and evacu@@ ated by the evacu@@ ated people . she asked her about the status of reconstruction and how her emp@@ athy has changed vis @-@ Ã  @-@ vis the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction to the article the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents had taken measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed find that still not enough in terms of disasters prevention has been done .
how it is about those who had to be evacu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its edition to commemor@@ ate the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the Ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to witness not only the massive earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma was also witness to the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear dis@@ integration that Japan had ever had to experience .
from 160 000 Ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma nearly 63 000 people were reloc@@ ated to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 a little more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , have been reloc@@ ated to permanent substitute homes .
after the 2017 stand there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside of their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the cat@@ astrop@@ hic areas , most of the Ev@@ acu@@ ees , who still live in shel@@ ters , are older than 50 years old . they are well @-@ known because efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma will have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people meet people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences seem to be larger than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , one often real@@ ises that one more than it seems at first glance .
these global connections are important , as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look closely at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we deal with issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they felt very strongly connected with someone about language and country borders .
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how the love for music has overwhel@@ med the lack of common language skills during a journey in rural China ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in artificial coma after being beaten by the police in nationwide demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z . release with permission .
right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva in a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer took him up against his head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia . millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity measures .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , studied Social Sciences at the federal university of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated on this Saturday and have now moved him into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which quickly spread in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police announced in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the end of the investigation of the incident from the active ministry .
the pictures show the police officer how he hits the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landing on the intensive care unit , his face would be on TV for six months and the entire repression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ missi@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a media channel by media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , in which one can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and rus@@ hing several param@@ ters to him shortly afterwards .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , is also immersed in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus starting at the 50@@ th second .
for the Mat@@ eus family , who lives in another state , Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian real re@@ ais ( approximately 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay at Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia while he is in hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
against police violence . &quot;
the drawing was shared several times in social networks .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado invites further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s :
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s experiences a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was murdered by his father because he supported the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . and now we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who is on the intensive care unit after being attacked by a polic@@ eman who has hit him face with a stroke .
police attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil , in which last Friday it came to brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
police officers at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had erected a stage for or@@ ators , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
the MP , Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Pe@@ ac@@ eful Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to reno@@ unce violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , the Brazilian media have covered road protests by focusing on another , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window disc .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo specifically reported a broken glass window to illustr@@ atively design their front pages with a photo .
on the other hand , O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set in fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window of windows than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a particular thing .
this must also be recognized if one is strictly against any form of damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here too , the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate importance , and the typical violent acts of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prot@@ esters on confron@@ tations with the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
villages forgotten by the de @-@ indu@@ str@@ alization in Cuba
with the launch of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso &apos;s law , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories all over Cuba joined the doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the popular community of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cub@@ an province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - Spanish sugar mill - despite the fact that there are no appreci@@ able sugar harvesting on site .
it was two years ago when the activities were paraly@@ zed in the sugar cane factories .
after exhaus@@ tion , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until the sm@@ ells of steel and concrete remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ ig@@ ned and comm@@ utes daily to the factories which still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an who rises every day at 4 : 00 o &apos;clock in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which after a long in@@ active time are back in operation because they were received .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene seems to have heard that Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich would receive the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad administration decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the amount produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no news anymore .
why was the Cub@@ an sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old rail@@ road of the church already saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction in the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated and hardly competitive , they became unbe@@ ar@@ able for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tons .
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ au@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price increased over a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ au@@ os per pound , published according to the 2016 report &quot; Agricultural perspectives &quot; by the OECD and FA@@ O , the Agricultural and Food Organisation of the United Nations .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate around 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years the de@@ commissioning of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full salary for further education .
the same happened in the Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich sugar cane factory on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez has worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , the word he repe@@ ats the most is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fraud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents agree : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first year of closing , the first letters began to come .
these were officially recorded documents , which would differ only with regard to the parts that would be removed , addressing and the date .
all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility was taken over and the letters were getting more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the dis@@ mis@@ sal factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation , &quot; he asser@@ ted .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , is waiting for the retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved against his will at the shut@@ down of the factory in which he helped .
with each part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 years of work .
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important working group was extingu@@ ished .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for the jobs and services generated by the plants in the communities in which they were located .
we will never know whether during the mamm@@ oth speech of October 21 , 2002 , the former president looked into the eyes of the people who were present , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation , everything would go well .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
since 2004 sugar cane has been extracted only high by grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years the popular community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to mi@@ tig@@ ate them , they stopped counting on the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with an advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they became spare parts .
without any future prospects , many young people also left the region .
a food factory was created in the area , whose production does not even serve the care of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still imposing .

first Nations young people use hip @-@ hop to express themselves and preserve their own culture
recording a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo taken with permission from N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
young people of the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them . they do this using hip @-@ hop , thanks to a series of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour , workshop leaders have provided mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the educ@@ ator David H@@ od@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then with the Cre@@ e Hi@@ p Hop Group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
the workshop aims to ensure that young participants engage in discussions on topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; or whatever comes to mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagon@@ ists .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the tribal area of the Kit@@ um@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia tells , for example , the history of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a section in Western Canada , where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered .
the cases were largely un@@ solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs is important despite the influences of global@@ isation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people did not always dominate the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the refrain is sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved got a little help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ star Hi@@ p Hop Group , who gave them a drop in Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dialect .
on the fac@@ ebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an the verse is available in tran@@ script , as well a translation into English , which is translated into German here :
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to go on my days on Earth
this is the day when you will take our cry
because we have lost our way in life as a youth
but I believe that we will rise some@@ day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and move forward as well as our youth
so they can do what they have ordained to the Creator
in the comment section , the reader and advoc@@ ate of Cre@@ e language also contributes to Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au and adds the verse to sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ ian ( which is also published on his blog and is published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( from the mas@@ h ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan you can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant .
in order to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , they are displayed near the entrance to sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ gu@@ u ( and the &quot; Plas@@ tics Models of the Cour@@ ts &quot; ) are issued by any food that is served in this restaurant .
customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the to@@ ki@@ er district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a variety of small businesses producing plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them any more . however , a new trend changes them today in striking cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ omas , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new with plastic rub@@ bers decorated mobile tapes as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods were turned into kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in Tokyo Station .
the new boom in food ageing is becoming more and more complex .
in this case , a ca@@ ther@@ less @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was turned into a mobile stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
this part is also part of the exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is a great design .
and that &apos;s just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
some mobile stand and cell phone designers allow you to make your own work of art . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or salmon roe is used , a popular t@@ opping , served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there anybody who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now can I decorate my mobile with salmon che@@ ating ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appealing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest mobile stand has the shape of mel@@ ted ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and palm @-@ rib@@ bons made of dried salmon .
more sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le plastic dishes can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # to be the # fan@@ ati@@ cal .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is devoted to the supply of the restaurant industry .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
a Mexican project tells stories of the survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; in Mexico , the missing and poll@@ uted ones regularly only appear in statistics . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
the report on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , completely re@@ pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict in the background .
on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the gri@@ eving or the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
behind each bone , behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed .
that is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with the drug traffi@@ cking &quot; ) that will give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were in the struggle between the law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project like this :
organised crime not only causes us to fear our lives .
the effects are much deeper .
for example , when shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as cre@@ eping as milk .
pain of the victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how fear life changes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who is looking for secret tom@@ bs after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ gu@@ ez , who in only one day lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priest : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like every Sunday we are preparing ourselves again today for the task that we have set ourselves to go and search for graves , for the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 , when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13 he left the house .
on October 15th he should be back , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training .
there is also my mother who is here with me too .
at the moment it has no income .
you are the insurance of my father , but she doesn &apos;t get paid off because they require a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get there ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and governance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a writer of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have known disease and sensation@@ alism for several years now .
I come across every day of newspaper cli@@ pp@@ ings and see the front pages with pictures , which can actually only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from experts from specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cous@@ in thinks that he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug traffi@@ ckers ) when he is big . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of offen@@ ders when they walk through the streets .
for me it &apos;s as if they ridi@@ cul@@ ed those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a stati@@ stic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crime of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbouring village are justified by the fact that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wat@@ ered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they are trying to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies if they are not stir@@ ring and silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the capital district : how a family with threats has been pl@@ under@@ ed . &quot; in this she describes how an armed criminal month for month paid money from her business until she had destroyed not only the business but also torn her family apart .
you think of everything you &apos;ve lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain of it never passes , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the far@@ ther we are away from each other , the better .
she concluded her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when to kidn@@ ap or kill you .
in these terrible days , I wondered if wines were to dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by the organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them .
Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells him that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , potatoes , tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for each year .
but they are in@@ significant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and he had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day that his childhood had ended .
his childhood had already passed two years before , when he saw only a few blocks from his home , seeing the bloody dead body of his father , which had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , as violence caused by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of kill@@ ings according to the Government of the Government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office included 3@@ 103 kill@@ ings . this corresponds to 8,5 per day average .
these are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico 2015 launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose goal is to illustrate the complex information behind the failed battle against drug traffi@@ cking , which has tor@@ mented the country in the last four decades .
when a picture is worth a thousand words
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ TION : this contribution and the pages to which he links contain images on which violence is portra@@ yed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fact @-@ check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a ru@@ mor or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how is the years after something is di@@ pped up for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to make trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false link between image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there are plenty of careful reporting on events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ?
in 2010 , a tank truck crossed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country had been neglected for years and thus devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become dangerous paths full of po@@ thol@@ es that were difficult to navigate .
tra@@ gically , the tan@@ ker dropped to the victim .
public authorities described a fire@@ ball , which envel@@ op@@ ed dozens of houses including a cin@@ emas nearby , which was full of people who watched the football world championship .
houses burned and char@@ red cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to ignorance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a picture entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Das ist Nigeria &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur Users My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of that day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ red bodies that are lined up on the ground while persons watching it .
but here the story doesn &apos;t come to its end .
over the years , the same photo was raised several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , and wrong@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an towns of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dr@@ astic atro@@ cities in which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one left to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many had been sh@@ attered , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images the following time could be visually displayed .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerged from the DR Congo , wrong@@ ly presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of abor@@ tions ; Africa check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the picture was presented as a proof of mass kill@@ ings .
one step further , personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely mistakenly attribute the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media to provide arguments .
the picture from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash message published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee were pun@@ ches , rape and several dead , some caused by burning .
while others reported about the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts appeared like the following who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi @-@ Arab news page , which was fal@@ sely claimed by President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein being , monks and politicians would have participated in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to survey this information .
the original contribution , which was recently accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be viewed here .
other news organizations that called AF@@ P as their source were wrong@@ ly attributed to Th@@ ein being this statement , but had not associated with that the picture taken from the DR Congo .
the global reach of false information
traces of these false links go back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse image search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can exceed boundaries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an in@@ verse picture search with the search@@ engine Tin@@ der has found 3@@ 44 pictures ( as of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures , which are very similar to the said image from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mas@@ ch of private sites , social media and community and national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have re@@ directed incorrect reports , while others have attempted to expose fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have del@@ im@@ ited examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use and associated them with the respective countries on which side they were published . by doing so , we want to illustrate the reach more clearly than by the language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases also inter@@ connected ) several examples can be used for ab@@ u@@ sive use .
here are some cases that can now be fully resolved ( on the map in Orange ) :
map : News frames .
country examples of wrong coupl@@ ings of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers that are still available through the examples of for@@ geri@@ es or false al@@ erts .
the grey countries are examples which , according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ der , probably also show for@@ gery .
as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma / Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo has been posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from DR Congo , with a tweet that expresses sympathy with the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and , on the other hand , the attempt of a blo@@ gger to legitim@@ ize the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are being prosec@@ uted .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government published a judi@@ ci@@ ary on what it sees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inten@@ tional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings in Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this adjustment , published exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of sm@@ ells that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech operate and used by extrem@@ ist groups to set out that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and mig@@ rate ( which is often spread by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .

the DR Congo &apos;s image emerged with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve greater attention by their communities these events that took place in the name of Islam .
USA , 2015 .
the picture was weather@@ ed as proof of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and over 9,@@ 300 times ) . but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media reporting in comparison to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Vietnam@@ ese ) , 2014 .
after a message allegedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it a false sign .
from the embassy in which the image from the DR Congo was included , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ tin Mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dis@@ soci@@ ated .
there are other confirmed examples of incorrect use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) , Tin@@ eye also points out , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and tim@@ e- / dat@@ est@@ amps exist on the web craw@@ ler and isolated they have image data names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original title of 2010 , the picture may ultimately be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or frames that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the assass@@ inations of Christians by Muslims , or - for the defense of Muslims - the assass@@ inations of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth examining how images are used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question is , however , what happens when readers can no longer believe these images .
with social media , there are tens of people who have in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently taken part in drinking water around a tragedy .
this mood of false and false information suggests that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and em@@ bel@@ lish the real horror of what is actually happening in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the dissemination of violent images has already been deb@@ ated extensively ( for example ) .
one argument is that ref@@ using images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes , these pictures are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ ze readers and viewers and take the ability to emp@@ ath@@ ize emp@@ athy ( such as this study that investig@@ ates how violent media act to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss about violent portra@@ y@@ als in the news media , the fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
techn@@ ologists experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake News . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be used detached from the context or in a completely ab@@ u@@ sive way .
any investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons uses according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog called un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. irre@@ plac@@ eable ) endeav@@ ours to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or at all not to translate .
there are such words in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well @-@ known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ br@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly resist any attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not enough , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes a little context are necessary to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for a long time in an online list .
most of these lists handle Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird chose to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find for example words from the tax @-@ lap language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - P@@ ut yourself around your parents in recognition of how your younger years have tried . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after being war@@ med up in the sun during cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they def@@ ro@@ de other cultures , reveal other thoughts and aw@@ aken our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page even more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these little languages are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; speakers of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are highly appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favourite sw@@ ells here . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floo@@ ding and floo@@ ding catastrophe in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally starts at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have entered into 15 districts in the south and west of the country over the shore .
following an opinion of the disaster center of Sri Lanka of May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundreds of people were missed because of the floo@@ ds and mu@@ ddy winds .
over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100,000 people were brought to 304 safe places of residence .
the rainf@@ alls closed on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly decreased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
floo@@ ds in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to flood the flood .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floo@@ ds wor@@ sen the den@@ gue fever , warns save the children after further rainf@@ alls are already on the way .
today the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus stood in the flood , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded because of yesterday &apos;s water p@@ eg@@ els of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations , and another five are ready to transport emergency supplies to the inhabitants en@@ rolled in their flooded villages .
various organizations and startups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situation and humanitarian assistance .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ bat@@ ana .
please call the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 today if you need help in this area .
the tax@@ i@@ u@@ f @-@ app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ y Centre will be informed .
last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me launched a &quot; flood aid &quot; button which allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . they were then sent to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross for free .
they also introduced a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button , which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people trapped by floo@@ ds and land@@ slides .
the combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring people in need of security and make help .
this has prevented the loss of other lives , and the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to the restoration of norm@@ ality .
the Muslims that cannot be seen
the Women &apos;s March on January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
in January , I participated in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and a dear friend .
I trust in her four years old daughter , she entru@@ sts me her children ; she is my rock in the surf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in one minute we call for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over the next few years , we are adding rights to trans@@ gender .
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some keep the iconic picture of a woman with a head@@ sc@@ arf , bound from an American flag , others sk@@ inn@@ ed slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already taken this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who know me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar that they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their imagination .
they ent@@ ang@@ ed me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not all look the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves with being a Muslim , in a different way . but somehow we all are put into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , as I do not fit in there , are ab@@ duc@@ ted .
to be dis@@ car@@ n@@ ated
I &apos;m not alone .
this is even done to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images do you think of when you think about him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Koran , and the Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry until the day he died .
but in the Western conception the religion Rum@@ is was extingu@@ ished , as well as the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting constitutes a large part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another exists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have colon@@ ized Western books for centuries .
this entic@@ ing visual language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid laid the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these pictures stand out even today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to perpet@@ rate them .
I have worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful , flaw@@ ed fo@@ es dominate our news feeds .
this narrative over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed the reality that nine Muslim women have w@@ aged their countries over the past three decades , while the US could not even choose their first female presidential candidate .
this narrative fails to acknowledge that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings and su@@ cking Saudi Arabian , Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body , these are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group ex@@ erts its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who conduct movements for change .
it sees that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who had been brought here by slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this narrative has occupied our collective imagination so deep and flaw@@ ed that often Si@@ kh men and children become the goal of anti @-@ militar@@ ist attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
belonging to the 1.7 billion
in the news industry , we do more than just telling stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the sc@@ ary of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed to find out where seven million Muslims represent the highest grade &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one @-@ third of the entire Muslim population is Afri@@ cans .
six of ten American Muslims are among the first @-@ generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .

approved for use .
four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
my mother put her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then , when Khan re @-@ designed the world &apos;s sky@@ lines , my parents were absolutely Muslims and Americans .
but am I now a Muslim and American ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting my Muslim recipes or doing my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chief , which all Muslims bear in themselves - &quot; out of respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
I don@@ t , we don &apos;t carry all pocket @-@ kit@@ es with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or almost always be selected for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of emin@@ ent Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who try to combat widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubric@@ ated Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with bank@@ ers , think tanks and experts for false information which our already er@@ ron@@ eous picture of what a Muslim is , or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in more than just a stranger who breaks down the head of a woman .
or as the terri@@ fying map of attacks on mos@@ ques throughout the USA , see below .
screen@@ shot of the AC@@ L@@ U website .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ug@@ ly forms attacks our belonging . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it eng@@ ages our identity , which is so extensive , so versatile and complex that it cannot fit into a drawer .

I would like to explain that .
I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim was only born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they return to the following terms : faith , behaviour and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbor , would see my rock in the surf that I am Muslim , if it could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the evening ritual with my daughter when I wie@@ ge her in my arms and whis@@ per her the Arabic verses to the protection which seal the Qur &apos;an and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them I repeat three times .
I ask that she is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim membership is always part of my shadow .

approved for use .
belonging is the image of my grand@@ mother on my mother@@ ly side with her sisters ; how they win a competition of art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi for decades ago .
it is the image of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and un@@ finished paintings painted Su@@ fi @-@ saint ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
being Muslim means speaking the prayers that she had told me when I have a bad day .
being Muslim is how she taught me to refer to God : God Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a nation , which - for centuries - was colon@@ ized by an &quot; empire , &quot; which was founded by a company named Ven@@ erable Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord .
the author 1987 with her grandfather .
approved for use .
belonging means growing up and hearing that men do not cry , but at the same time see that my immig@@ rant grandfather cri@@ es .
in the meantime , while he writes books about modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , N@@ ana J@@ aan wept for his family in India , ruling K@@ ash@@ mir , family , which he was not allowed to close to his arms in half a century .
belonging is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have divided the Muslim world as at the play risk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; being Muslim means knowing that over the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; colonial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all up to four Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means knowing that the first pilot &apos;s bomb of history was thrown over a Muslim country a century ago .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , c@@ ash@@ mere descend@@ ant of the British empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mos@@ que in England .
before there were air@@ planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I had ever been and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

to my Muslim Tri@@ b@@ une of the 1,7 billion , go deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ born story .
it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops scattered across each continent apart from the Antar@@ ctic , went to Iraq to pursue mass destruction weapons that did not exist .
it means knowing more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried beneath the w@@ reck@@ age of war .
being an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy hits the USA and the susp@@ ects wearing a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ ination .
it means knowing that four hundred years ago the first call of prayer , called Az@@ aan , was called by a liber@@ ated black slave named Bil@@ al .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago , an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people over@@ crowded the airports to fight against Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ist , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple junc@@ tions , but to fail to communicate them to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the narrative of the 1,7 billion holds more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reducing duality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
being a mother means caring for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is made up of Muslim registri@@ es which began with President Bush and expanded under President Obama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists of the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in a country that exclu@@ des its borders towards people from just the countries that are bombing it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ fly @-@ list &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which largely targets Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars we lead and the bombs that we take to Muslim lands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study called A@@ scent of Man , scientists at the Nor@@ th@@ western University showed a scientifically accurate picture and asked them to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 with respect to evolution .
Muslims were given the lowest score .
the conversations we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deeply advised to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enth@@ use &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stand back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the flaw@@ ed and dangerous impressions we have in our news editorial offices .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims in the media industry , which attempts to grasp our often marked identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast Lake Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ Feed ; the vir@@ ale video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square on black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sch@@ ust@@ ers Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increase Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this makes me hope .

col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned about this difficult global timing in which we are .
and this moment has consequences that exceed 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ or@@ ist who existed in the dark corners of the Internet now lead the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years before , they had not yet given them ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history I was not aware of when I was as old as my daughter is now , but who today made me an unden@@ i@@ able Muslim .
things I left here as a bread@@ crum@@ b in my speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; things that may evoke memories , for in all the inter@@ sections that make up our humanity , there may be a story where someone is made to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversations will take place during the 8th Annual Meeting on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred academ@@ ics speak about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually take in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars will be led and people have been moderni@@ zed by the creation of the &quot; others &quot; in public presentation , four decades ago , was the scientist of Stan@@ ford .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of it , consciously and un@@ consciously to soli@@ di@@ fy the &quot; other . &quot; just as my girlfriend and I have done in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have no president , the chocolate cake is being bombar@@ ded , while he has already broken lands and &quot; other made &quot; human beings , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity
story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , the creation of stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the insur@@ moun@@ table blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and honour the diversity of languages of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has been running events since 2015 , there is a risk that small and not quite small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
for the makers of the project applies :
the mass mort@@ ality of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where residents don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening often is connected to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; understand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to appreciate , feel , touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers present their story first in their own language and then translate or explain them in English .
even if the participants are not a professional story t@@ eller , their dedication and representation contribute to the fact that the audience takes care of it .
they evoke laughter and emotions , as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso that is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller Ras@@ si@@ dat@@ ou also sei@@ zes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art in her country .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ ara tells the f@@ ables of the rab@@ bit and the Bab@@ oon in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after explaining the meaning of his f@@ ables , John Ny@@ am@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a broad gr@@ in he shares his sense of inclu@@ si@@ veness :
you have listened !

Puerto Rico demands US re@@ establishment of public debt
with the aim of re@@ viewing the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounted to 72 million US dollars , various religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration on April 3 , 2017 ; the march started with the gr@@ ati@@ cal cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went to Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ an .
it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Front for the Ne@@ ural Ex@@ am@@ ination of Deb@@ t ) and the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Assembly of Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of re @-@ fixing the debt also filed a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people Puerto Ric@@ os claim that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debt will be held ac@@ coun@@ table for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we demand a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions appropriate remuneration that acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are pressed and oppressed .
the people Puerto Ric@@ os refused to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to reconci@@ le with sin@@ king pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not integrated into the territory of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy &quot; is propos@@ ing a non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto Ric@@ os requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure .
measures imposed from outside will be je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed without the participation and conviction of citizens to be rejected by the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration brought the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Night watch for light and truth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions he made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : Public@@ a , the annual conference on digital culture , which is hosted in Berlin , an event dedicated to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign .
MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the French @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , managing director of Book S@@ prints , produces excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective Inqu@@ iry ( The Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective Night Research ) .
the book , published last year and is available here license @-@ free , contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it says :
this book wants to discuss how mo@@ tions for free knowledge are built up and what the real costs are with which this is connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create a sense of our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been det@@ ained in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was removed from the directory of the A@@ dra Pr@@ ison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about his current state or residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice , who want to push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , instantly .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have let us start thinking about their own destiny , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we decide for ?
what have we given up in this process of temporary extreme convic@@ tions ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody for Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred to an unknown place from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military establishment .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; military police bass was taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that on 12 November 2015 , they were contacted by persons who presented themselves as the in@@ sider of the Assad government and notified them of an alleged death sentence against their husband .
but its place of stay and condition remains unknown .
a pioneer of creative com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria .
Bar@@ ry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Basel &apos;s cultural prototypes was more pro@@ spect@@ able than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important arch@@ eological sites in the world , was the intersection of numerous civili@@ zations and here combines Greek @-@ Roman architectural styles with local traditions and Persian influence .
at that time Bass@@ el was not able to know that ten years after he began work , the IS would make everything possible to extingu@@ ish this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Syria , but of the world .
this expedition into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be inv@@ alu@@ able for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
stran@@ gely , Bass@@ el has not been able to complete this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life with it , dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was in jail .
I have learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked . he taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of waiting ( waiting ) , a pro@@ stitute that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in custody .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for a year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English .
the book is available free of charge .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is happening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happens at every visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace ,
that every danger doesn &apos;t matter to me ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guar@@ dians
I forget the j@@ ail@@ ment of prison
and I will enter into every detail of your voice and words .
which I am with passion with me ,
when your eyes bid farewell
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I return quickly to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to bring back all the moments ,
and over your absence to cry and smile .
I witness myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the detention of Bass@@ el , G@@ haz@@ i wrote :
a year passes , my soul
during the period of time
I am in your cage ,
and you are still in the cage of the monsters
Bas@@ le &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those arrested or disappeared under the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in detention until 2016 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
today , we repeat our demand in the hope we have to do for the last time .
Mozambique : back to previous post due to corruption @-@ judging Director after release
with anger , Mozambique re@@ acted to a corruption incident where a government member returned after half of his prison sentence to the state apparatus in which corruption was committed .
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 together with four other defend@@ ants for an em@@ be@@ zz@@ lement of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( about 800 000 Euro ) .
the money came from public money from the airports of Mozambique , whose advice was Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 due to good leadership and immediately called for his res@@ etting to the company , which happened on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General &apos;s Office of the Republic who submitted the application , there would be no obstacle to Cam@@ ba@@ za to return to his old post because the company did not undergo disciplinary proceedings after his detention .
however , many people don &apos;t know the action well .
in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Int@@ egri@@ da de P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , condemned the decision of the company to res@@ ign the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and exemp@@ li@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step backward with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we are aware of is that even the company should have initiated a disciplinary action against the offen@@ ders .
however , the company apparently held no reasonable legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Moz@@ am@@ bic@@ anian social media , also re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disgu@@ sting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent type , he would be a consultant , after being sentenced to a prison sentence and half of whom had served .
he could keep paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company he helped to harm .
consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is happy to be paid for his silence .
contradic@@ tory !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil , says the director has no moral :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was rewarded by the State because he was insul@@ ting him , I can &apos;t believe someone in such a way rewarded the state so mas@@ sively .
Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks morality and to serve the state * he had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but only served himself by the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible fund of money and the state itself became tired of this man who was pre @-@ loaded and sentenced to a long prison term .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ us pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remind a th@@ ief in prison :
thi@@ eves are part of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison , not only for the first independent president , but also as sharp , single @-@ tail@@ ed and - by the way - proph@@ etic speakers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of his most famous oral representations was when he vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious man is capable of all , including fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest , for sale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that he is not that way . he changes tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious man is at the same time criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he was 10 years old and was free .
and today the company , in which he rep@@ ents money , sets him under contract again . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ than@@ is - blu@@ epr@@ ints ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) May 12 , 2017

&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users wrong@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or sp@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts out of the net , because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although it is still discussed about the origin of the word , it is usually used to refer to people of Eastern indi@@ an origin or generally be used as an adj@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook is cens@@ oring the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mas@@ ked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese writing ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ating conn@@ ot@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with racism , but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that even po@@ sts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubt for their use have been cens@@ ored .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with fundamentally different mean@@ ings that have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair on Bur@@ scar@@ is also written &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ei@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ king A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because it contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he had asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a p@@ un .
the sentence ku la - &quot; He@@ aling &quot; + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ mes@@ an - resembles the rac@@ ist expression much , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet believes that she will reduce hate speech by radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook needs to be more analytical before it destro@@ ys all the posts that are suspected of spreading racism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook does not delete the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; manually . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it automatically filters the word .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on Fac@@ be@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the remaining words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , receive a fairly good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who dissemin@@ ates hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy will not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks simply begin to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to clear his posts when he wanted to let his friends know that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new policy of Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is closed .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from posting , posting and sharing content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; posted the Facebook Community Standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speeches of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech removed from Facebook .
in the post , the author expressed his opinion on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism are bad in the country .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asking for advice :
Facebook likes a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma by its platform , but it does not work .
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pe@@ as curr@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied Po@@ sts .
if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a great deal of sales , that would be great .
Facebook &apos;s automatic cens@@ orship has provided a lot of spam among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and deliberately write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken off the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that didn &apos;t contain any hate speech but were nonetheless removed :
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese lyrics are &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as curr@@ y and watch an Indian movie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to try out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kal@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you then heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should hei@@ gh@@ ten violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where conflicts between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his failure to bring out the balancing hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese sides .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it would have been better to focus more on context than focused initiatives and learned from them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is finished with the chil@@ dr@@ ens
a wedding ring in the sand .

the to@@ dd@@ lers are now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law to ban this practice , so that the age of marriage is now 18 .
at that time , Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the Inter@@ religious Organization ( I@@ RO ) , a group called representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere , as that , age , does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contractual partner of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Rights of the United Nations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defining the min@@ ors as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every person under the age of 18 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children already married to 15 in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago was 2.8 percent , and with 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married under 19 of 1997 @-@ 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements endeav@@ ored to aboli@@ sh laws for children &apos;s marriage followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this result .
nevertheless , not everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms to say to the critics of the chil@@ dr@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; they were supposed to take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition provided tension in this actually un@@ complicated case , and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the draft law at all .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill against the chil@@ dr@@ ens &quot; marriage was decided - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who ab@@ stained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
now only the president of the country must agree and let the law be proclaimed .
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ An@@ n Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ ag@@ ram again :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the chil@@ dr@@ ens was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and not one single against it .
having previously decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of social media users were enthusiastic because the laws had finally been changed for the children &apos;s marriage .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is a Minister of Education in the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk , which disgu@@ ised the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is worth almost every price .
while Abel Jackson was the opinion , it was definitely long enough to aboli@@ sh the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally arrived :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , Excell@@ ent news !
the marriage network has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 on the other hand ! ! ! ! &quot;
F@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group , which openly spoke openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted :
the age of marriage in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now 18 years , independent of religious affili@@ ation .
the draft for the amend@@ ment of the marriage network was decided today , on 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 of them were present in the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all de@@ pu@@ ties opposed to the law have voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chil@@ dr@@ ens &apos; marriage is no longer permitted by law in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ marri@@ age@@ bed@@ dab@@ use .
many thanks to all the activists who fought him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our MEPs .
however , a potential hook occurs in the form of Sat @-@ Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the well @-@ known Hin@@ du organization of the country .
months ago , Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take legal steps , the law should be adopted , and he seems to redeem his promise now .
during the General At@@ tor@@ ney General , Paris Al @-@ ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said it was quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj wanted to act against the law , most social media users desired the debate on the subject differently .
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion so broad@@ ly , in a way that we , to invite the state into our bedrooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; simply pur@@ pos@@ efully say that the state , our daughters , protects them from being ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men that are opposed to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would you be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to a legal action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where children are legal or still the norm in various levels , although there are laws which they under@@ line .

although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to use b@@ ypass tools for blocked websites ( a recent article by the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence of the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia since 2008 , as described recently in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
after China Turkey is the second most known country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked there are now several mirrors ( pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform laid down all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( computer calcul@@ ator connections ) , which does not rely on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
the content is available despite legal prohibition .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after listening to the messages ( via the block@@ age of Wikipedia ) , we used everything to place sn@@ apshots from Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . so there is the possibility to read the contents on de@@ centralized and distributed way .
this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org itself .
IP@@ FS has also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it only deals with screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni of Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a mirrors page from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that anyone can use to host similar mirrors , if in the respective country Wikipedia is banned .
con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member as well as staff at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a proxy address , a mirror .
you access a different URL that is not the original . that what you see is from Wikipedia .
in essence , the server sends the request to the right Wikipedia page , so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey .
this is done by a server which is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for conservation
a succ@@ inct r@@ hin@@ oc@@ eros , ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ red with poorly positioned motifs and well @-@ washed colors .
this motivated him to carry a camera and try to stra@@ igh@@ ten the situation .
back then he was a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to bring Nepal &apos;s wildlife to the international stage .
and his hom@@ etown , right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention on Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this prime situation helps in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wild animal photographer ! !
I just rested at home when I suddenly called me to Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan Lake ) . he had received a call from my father that would be a le@@ op@@ ard on the banks of the Rap@@ ti River .
the dam is only a few minutes from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard found itself and I immediately started to bend pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to cooperate with the authorities to gain global recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he should know &#91; it &#93; ; for he was already face to face to Tig@@ ers :
a tiger cannot be bo@@ thered by the mind of the sheep during sleep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the bu@@ zz@@ ing appeared . he immediately sat down , we look at him and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! !
&quot; &quot; &quot; to promote the protection of wild animals Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I click for conservation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , his passion for promoting Nepal &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and usually lived in a tent to make recordings of Ot@@ ters at the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds who live near the tourist arri@@ vals .
take a look at some of these photos below .

years after the wedding , Indian women dare to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands for the first time

this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally appeared on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organisation from India .
a revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India women have the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead they use a pron@@ o@@ omen or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h women admit that due to social pressure they should respect the husband , as well as fear of the consequences they should use the norm to keep this practice alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted by the Indian State of O@@ dish@@ a and rejected by her family and the village community after addressing a married relative with names .
the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives also not by name is widespread also among men . however , they have far less assurance to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the P@@ une district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel and house@@ wives , joined a unique club and became the main theme of the city .
it is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
as one of 56 clubs there are in 13 Indian states , he is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign , which is operated by the Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er community and advoc@@ ates for the removal of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ist has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera at the discovery of practices , such as children &apos;s marriage to the exile of HIV and AIDS infected , and leads this club .
she tells us how these clubs create a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her panel discussion was of women who did not call their hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this subject because she wanted to open up the discussion about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
not to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands as lou@@ dly , is a custom that they all maintain and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and desires a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is considered a dec@@ eit@@ ful woman , a woman without mor@@ als .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about it until this discussion .
Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband at the beginning , wanted to try out at home , how it works .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband kept silence for a long time after the video ended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him by now on his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini started her first discussion with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
then she asked all , &quot; If we can &apos;t say the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equal ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day on which they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ist from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about breaking a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women can never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so shy that she was only taking care of herself during the whole exercise , and another decided to release the whole gra@@ ined fru@@ stration with him and his family by cursed him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in the rush of adren@@ alin to have broken with an age @-@ old custom , the women decided that they would actually attempt at home to call their hus@@ bands on behalf .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received a large number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put the woman in her head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner in front of the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation escal@@ ated in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ no@@ cent red dot on the forehead , which indicates the Eh@@ est@@ atus :
why do women only need to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would wear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot if he did it too .
he laugh@@ ed , and I stopped wearing it .
the other women have not stopped completely with it , but think they are now in a better position to choose to not wear it on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip to each discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
usually we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their life ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never really talked about some things , such as our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say certain things loud , no matter how small they happen to you .
in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothes .
some women in the group have been wearing sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most , that &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a sage @-@ kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants , they haven &apos;t dar@@ ed .
after much dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own choice of clothes , morality linked to the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled her own couple of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion , so that the women could wear them .
next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will do it .
Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly rolling in the five months since the first lu@@ b of the discussion :
so far we have only made small steps .
some women tried it a few times , but then stopped to tell the name of their husband .
some , including me , make it , but only if they are alone and there are no other members of the family .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini declares :
each of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am it too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a memorial day
the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
on June 29 this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was to be found in the jap@@ an@@ ese Twitter Trend , where many fans ex@@ changing memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a turning point in the Japanese culture of the post@@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who was exclusively inter@@ viewed in London in 1964 , re@@ marked the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just under five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
people here have become quite quickly aware that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many well @-@ known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the cult band &apos;s music is &quot; more than just a universal language , &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
good morning ! today is the Beat@@ les memorial day in Japan .
still today songs are sung by the Beat@@ les in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English tuition in Japanese medium schools .
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les out@@ lived everything .
today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doll should represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as it belongs to fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the well @-@ known places associated with the band .
if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places you absolutely must visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( Memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 ) ( From the Link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be bizarre enough :
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
in 1966 the Beat@@ les arrived in Japan for the first time .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .
we did the same last year .
and of course , some companies also use the fan base in terms of market terms , such as the R@@ amen Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen !
and what could that be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; today I will listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is how the day will run today .
so , we hope you are there !

gli@@ b men will be ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia warned the population that gli@@ b @-@ headed men could be in Mozambique &apos;s target of attacks .

a new system of kidn@@ apping of rough @-@ headed persons for organ traffi@@ cking , probably for believing ends , worries the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ le , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was found de@@ capit@@ ated and some of the organs were taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently conf@@ essed that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi are used .
there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a gli@@ mmer man can unlock gold or bring wealth , the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia said to the BBC .
it is the first time that successive ass@@ aults on gli@@ b @-@ headed men were registered in Mozambique .
another group , the goal of sub@@ missions for ob@@ sk@@ ure purposes , is people with Al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the UN to carry out a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania where the government developed campaigns to combat these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who are going to travel to the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who go to Mozambique travel bald men in Mozambique are the aim of ritu@@ alistic attacks , warned the mos@@ ambi@@ an police following the latest assass@@ inations of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange where the kill@@ ings took place .
hus@@ hed Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and inhabit@@ ant of the city of In@@ ham@@ b@@ e in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police have already followed the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and murder of sli@@ pping @-@ headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala , province of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also indicates that a belief exists , according to which the victims had power in the head power generating wealth .
in the last days three men with hair loss problems were murdered in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared on Facebook the chron@@ icle of B@@ log@@ gers poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who indicated that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique :
I M@@ Ã@@ CH@@ TS like TO BE Mos@@ ambique , TH@@ AT I am ashamed of a country where the people would be ashamed to demand sex against good marks , and others would not hurt others or even take their lives to earn their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald heads are hun@@ ted for un@@ believers or &quot; black magic . &quot;
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some of the opportunities for mac@@ ab@@ ren hum@@ our could not be missed .
Zen@@ aida Mak@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter users , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the boss of the district Mor@@ ru@@ mb@@ ala , Pedro Sap@@ ange , and the police spokesperson Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zi@@ as , In@@ Ã¡@@ cio D@@ ina , both are gl@@ atz@@ kÃ¶@@ ping :

a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria , active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) played a key role in expanding public access to the internet and open knowledge .
he was a close friend of many from the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in our meeting in the Arab B@@ logger in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ tia &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she was contacted by people who were themselves in@@ sider of the Assad government .
they reported that their husband was sentenced to death , but gave no further information .
Bas@@ tia &apos;s stay and constitution remained unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials discovered that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , Bass@@ el &apos;s works as a pioneer of the open web movement prove the honour .
and we appreciate the efforts of all the people and organisations who have been campaig@@ ning for his release over the last five years .
since 2011 and the beginning of protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have van@@ ished , the Syrian Network for Human Rights .
countless of those arrested by the regime were subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
between 2011 and 2016 , no less than 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have been put to death in awareness , such as the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International .
the fate of many people remains unknown .

free Bass@@ el : ne@@ tizen &apos;s Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and dis@@ sident Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably just recently made .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has drawn attention in the international community after his attorney announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized for liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o calling for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Department in China has referred Li@@ us case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal affair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and a narr@@ ator says he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not deemed necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless China continues to appeal calls from the international community , Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to release or allow him treatment abroad .
while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out of the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
united nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a speaker refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow a treatment abroad for Li@@ u .
Norway - Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and foreign minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway was st@@ alled after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government ha@@ st@@ ened that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were res@@ um@@ ed until December of last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon exports to China , as exports have been largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his prize .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union - European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately release Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for China to release Li@@ us , as stated in a statement on 30 June :
at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife and family members .
they should meet and receive all the visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wish him that he has the opportunity to treat him abroad insofar as he can help him in his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the US embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced on 27 June that the message agency AF@@ P asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest .
the demand for the US embassy attracted a fur@@ ious response from China , with the utter@@ ance of the State Department that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared with the fact that China should offer the following to the couple :
protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice , to which it claims according to Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .
I urge China to un@@ condition@@ ally release Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o in order for him to embar@@ k on proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany and Germany
German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hopes that &quot; Li@@ u &quot; gets all the medical support he needs and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July .
previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing reported to the news agency Reu@@ ters that China had great qual@@ ms about whether the vor@@ tex around Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit in Hamburg .
Canada and Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked China to provide Li@@ u with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ u At@@ tor@@ ney told AF@@ P before that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that it is not allowed Li@@ u to talk and contact someone outside , including his lawyers .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to release the rights reserved to the exercise of these rights .
France and France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry requested China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons in a declaration on 29 June :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him .
although the news station France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there will be no further information whether France will ultimately record it .
Taiwan and Taiwan
the Council of continental seats in Taiwan called on China on 27 June to release Li@@ u and show a greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu M@@ ei @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , expressed himself very much in a statement on 28 June around Li@@ u and admitted that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us well being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives which he took and for whom he had been strictly punished would have led to a more harmonious , more stable and aff@@ lu@@ ent China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may seem foolish since Singapore is recognised as an independent state at an international level .
but according to Minister of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , Singapore was to be considered a city .
this remark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of meeting the international branch of the New York Bar Association , the Minister noted that many people critic@@ ised Singapore &apos;s only political party because they compared Singapore to other countries .
he supported Singapore to be regarded as a city .
... no one has asked whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o blog accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; twist the logic &quot; to defend the existing authorit@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore .
and then , after all our efforts and efforts to create this precious land , we can say that we are not a country in the end .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you &apos;re not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons given by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of it , he inevitably appeared un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he has defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities which are permanently run by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core of the subject , the good old ly@@ re emerges from the authorit@@ arian rulers who pret@@ end to be democr@@ ats , leave the distorted logic , as it fits better to their power .
in the end , the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am gave answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judicial system , our political system really non @-@ responses .
he disgu@@ ised the corresponding questions with non @-@ answers ration@@ ally .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls on Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am to clarify his opinion , since she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
when Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am would take the trouble to clarify this point as long as he was paid up to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by publishing his comment on the blog , An@@ on points out that he should start reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference so that one can better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said Singapore is rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections are so un@@ even important even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the US ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be no country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , the leader of a growing generation that makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice said of Singapore ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard that expected me - if I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , a member of the new generation of political leaders in Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it , and is aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review de@@ compos@@ es the weaknesses of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am committed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good faith &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian interpreter ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only seen as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , what country will the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
as he plays an important role within the government cabinet , Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am &apos;s statements are of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapore do their military service , do they defend their city but not their country ?
who must pay our Prime Minister bills ?
what is the value of our Pink Person@@ nel Training ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; journey of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and was always a city : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapore ...
nobody ever said Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country above all &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the myth of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice Canadian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home country or your home country ?
your answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series that revealed ru@@ mo@@ urs about certain parts of the world and to show another fac@@ et .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question I asked most in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live in Japan again and again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions .
on my clari@@ fication most of the time the standard response follows : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans perhaps cook internally against anger when they are held for Americans , but I don &apos;t bo@@ ther me .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that Can@@ adi@@ ans differenti@@ ate us from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans make a Canadian flag visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand ... .
so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and September 11 .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried little map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free healthcare !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excuse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant country against ethnic groups .
we are not as these guys south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends , whom I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter if you were confused with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first of all : being called &quot; nice &quot; means to be ze@@ al@@ ous - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders of &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has its own Canadian double @-@ worker ) .
if Canada really were a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing at which one can stum@@ ble .
being harmless , means to be in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and do not deserve attention .
this can be something good if you want to remain un@@ noticed in the background , far away from the things that happen around you .
I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone is a main feature of Can@@ adi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence with the neighbours .
we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau went on stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister made Canada almost sexy .
music Video of a Pop @-@ Band par@@ o@@ dic@@ ts Thailand &apos;s Jun@@ ta
a pop band , famous in Thailand , has published a music video that par@@ o@@ dic@@ ts the j@@ un@@ ta , which seized power in 2014 and , despite its promise , re@@ inst@@ alls the civil government , continues to rule the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new song &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man telling what regulations his girlfriend makes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although not explicitly political , the music video refers indirectly to the continuing military rule of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video for the song was a huge success .
in the first three days alone , the video uploaded to Facebook was shared 1,@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists called the public to watch this video . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as it relates to the situation of the country under the j@@ un@@ ta rule .
take a look at these photos of the video that relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persist@@ ently followed over the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional Constitution , which gives the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army an absolute decision @-@ making authority over important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your mind@@ set &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; setting @-@ up &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people considered by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other revi@@ e@@ wers of the state .
for this purpose , a new unity was set up in the army that monitors online content and accused persons accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thailand sets a strict sense against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; read Maj@@ esty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black v@@ ans before putting them into an intern@@ ment store , another problem .
some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long sentences , they should ins@@ ult the monarchy .
meanwhile the te@@ aser of the band showed members of the band who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Hunger Games Tri@@ bute , &quot; which was used by Putin &apos;s opponents during the 2014 protests .
life continues in the ruins of the gh@@ ost cities in eastern Ab@@ ch@@ asia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission .
the post @-@ war society only slowly reco@@ vers in East Asia , especially in the T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al district .
over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ sic war has been officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still very visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ kh@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ Ã­@@ ava are located in the basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , write @-@ downs , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together on Soviet sites in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today , most of the Russians and rab@@ bits live in the area .
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost cities in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period more than 10.000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ ost cities .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district was 16@@ ,000 people after barely a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ ch@@ uk@@ ow@@ kas stand symbo@@ lically for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings have fallen down and are rarely inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha village I met a native older man .
he starts talking and it is difficult for him to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why speak ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is still un@@ ambig@@ uous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were municipal centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , all of which served the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded magnific@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty residents live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ us@@ h@@ ch@@ ow@@ kas that still house one or two families can be seen on the balconies , where linen is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately withdraw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother has forbidden us to be photograph@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her girlfriend and suddenly she leaves the destroyed house and disappears .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ Arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( farming of agricultural products for self @-@ consumption ) such as animal hus@@ band@@ ry , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation .
it &apos;s difficult to get over the rounds .
in winter the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini &quot;
about ten years ago , an elderly woman named Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her oldest daughter living in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave Ab@@ ch@@ asia in order to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain in Ab@@ ch@@ asia forever , &quot; she says .
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very hard to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells her that she and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
when holidays are , we visit us .
but we can &apos;t do this all the time - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot;
as she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tells T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could build zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day , it reminds us of the village life before the war .
despite the relatives living in central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ ch@@ asia just broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) .
we want to build a house there , but it will take some time , &quot; she explains .
Nat@@ ascha receives approximately $ 9 child allowance for each child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has their own farm .
near the house , where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chi@@ ckens .
she tells us that it was a very sc@@ ary situation at first when many people left the village after the war .
but over time , she lost her anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark street or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war , there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right .
every day I remember how the city and the war were once . &quot;
when our conversation comes to an end , a little boy runs over to us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him behind .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now tracks the ball scre@@ aming .
while they run , some of them throw stones on the abandoned buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood , which are responsible for in@@ security in their lives .
they do not know it differently .

Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places for their hospitality are known . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink spectacle frame and gold @-@ colored earrings in ted@@ dy bear form .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about $ 2.@@ 50 the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - but there are hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , Ms Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells , people come in full small buses and from the upper part of the coast they start calling : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; where are you Mama Africa ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept outside on cardboard boxes .
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anyone .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , she bu@@ ys them drugs that they cannot pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently .
I asked him if M@@ um Africa was a reasonable nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family Sebas@@ ti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gurt sta@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to come to Boston to find her husband and the three children there .
you have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tells that the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel along the route and that Afri@@ cans are already talking about W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived beforehand in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the football world championship .
when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will contact Ms Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our Mother and we never leave her going , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers , smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells her that her guests send her often text messages when they have gone to greet her or tell her about the course of her journey .
she declares that her Christian faith is the pro@@ pul@@ sion of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken like in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps well @-@ known here , but she is not the only spark hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken migrants in their small house .
he is polic@@ eman and found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
he started to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela declares that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing .
I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people can help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
after he lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job .
the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula come from Central America , others also open the doors of their homes for them .
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children , who wanted to squee@@ ze money from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and a stranger , a single educ@@ ator , offered him her roof .
a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go next .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests .
in the cor@@ rid@@ ors , travellers still consult their phones .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part from Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also no@@ stal@@ gic because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grand@@ mother she leaves her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair lich@@ ens she has made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly as she introduces her to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she repe@@ ats every time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have already gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
a check point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter users will be out of the line .
the residents of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority in western China , are forced to install sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on July 10 , mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of the town of Uru@@ m@@ qi were given a mobile notification in which it instruc@@ ts the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the announcement , the app is said to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities also used the app to use the app for more than fighting terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because they , shortly after having installed the app , had exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
in the communication of the police , the app was able to detect and track the sources and distribution channels of terrorists along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main feature is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network .
this app with the filters for min@@ ors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while reporting about digital cens@@ orship in China is mostly focused on the experience of users in major cities in the east and south , reality is very often dark for those who live in remote , crowded areas of ethnic minorities such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs .
the media outlet based on Twitter , &quot; Images from mainland China , &quot; published cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where polic@@ emen checked the residents in@@ discrimin@@ ately to see if they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official j@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use devices intended for older people .
this is a form of imprisonment by the rest of the rest .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; ( out of the scale of the world ) also published a j@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can raise the password request of a Windows operating system and thus receives un@@ restricted access to the hard drive of the computer .
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones will become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang .
the Reg@@ ulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content .
all government branches , government agencies and affiliated institutions including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office when operating their computers and communication devices .
a recent report by Freedom House , a U.S. human rights organisation , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Uru@@ m@@ qi to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; by the local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Uru@@ m@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole series of other possible off@@ ences , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or Death , Part 1 : everything scre@@ ams after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sle@@ ep or Death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian jail . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world you look at yourself and make sure you are alone in a place where everything is important .
everything has resolved gradually and reveals a truth that is clearly recognis@@ able from inside and outside .
one that makes all honour to her name .
one that has settled in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
but when the reality cat@@ ches you back and you look behind the scenes - beyond the actor , the beautiful scenes and the actors - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood , and everything scre@@ ams after death .
all doubts settle in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even when the Earth is spinning on the axis of the evil . you realize that you are trapped between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone built around stone .
they arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to &quot; learn &quot; my lesson , as the head of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest such as we@@ eds .
it was enough for the city to cr@@ ush the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ams .
all the districts cov@@ eted , only my own .
for the first time it was silent , un@@ ra@@ vel@@ ing , at the wrong time , even if I did not raise any high demands on a city that has been stuff@@ ed up into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accompli@@ ces .
in the third night things had a little cal@@ ming down after the power supply stopped in the district .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke the silence by shou@@ ting several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice echo through silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to gather together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we joined a grand picture that filled my expectations fully and fully .
at such a moment , you realize that you liber@@ ate the mind from the lamp , but it &apos;s just not interest you in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make you ready , we meet at the military safety building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ amed them all the way up to the security service office .
I arrived there .
the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an was there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear how you shou@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or you are brave enough to cry when we are not near . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes focused on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you don &apos;t dare to look at my eyes and not on the floor ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was in my foo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps at the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so certain to my cause when I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t think you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest of entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I do not regret a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement and with his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is the same with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cursed sentence is up to this day in my nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a mental torture that I was exposed for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I walked through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
then back through the farm and into the second office that leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I remember all the details before I was in charge of the room .
otherwise they probably assigned me a bigger cell this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share them with only one more prisoner , and I must put them immediately without waiting for their permission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I grab@@ bed an old @-@ time communication method : beating against the wall with fist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell @-@ mate was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; det@@ ain@@ ee &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation , he finally answered me .
apparently in none of the surrounding cells there was a prominent middle aged man who looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in perfect darkness there are no markings on me , and doctors do not exist here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers deny its existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I remain .
li@@ ars .
I would have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive out all these crow@@ s , which lab@@ oured in the fruit of the garden of my head .
from the distance I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cri@@ es rang out every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the colour of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that showed us the horror in person : the ra@@ ad ( for example : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; all@@ usion to 13 S@@ ure of the Koran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the secret was lifted : in order to protect the state security against us and prevent us from releasing the betra@@ yer and the terrorists in us , they speak in the Albanian dialect - so they played their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ list and betra@@ yed the narrow view of their world view .
this is not a house that is not a country here ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero .
I enter the audi@@ torium and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and stock@@ y man ; at least he seems to me so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that are der@@ ailed to him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join those ro@@ dents and protest on demonstrations that will soon come to an end anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I am used to not responding .
I can &apos;t say exactly when ins@@ ults and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary communication medium after a friendly conversation .
when and how it happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to get used to the punishment of being punished , even though I had done nothing to deserve this punishment .
on punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe which probably stems from the clo@@ aking .
your exec@@ ution@@ er shall delight in your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure with him , and you cannot with@@ hold your cry .
my cri@@ es were not yet enough , which is why they exchanged the tube through a cable .
at my first arrest , I asked myself if the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a refuse collector or if that belonged to normal work equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables in order to present us the great invention of a giant cable from their point of view .
within a single hour three of them changed while I was still in the row .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I heard crying out .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and didn &apos;t take pleasure in it , which is why he picked up an electrically charged rod .
electricity flow@@ ed my whole body , enough to supply all my quarters .
my half @-@ naked body , stretched out on the floor , was the perfect conductor .
the de@@ af@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours passed , which happened to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am answering the voice of an exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father must make himself fear@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and move , you will be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and opposition
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time indoors ; sometimes he locks to his canvas , sometimes to his computer , sometimes to his couch .
but what one can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips spotted with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives on the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family to flee out of their village in Palestine in which they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ es ( about : Far@@ mer ) .
for six years now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist opposed to the conservative majority and questioned her old @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ es@@ eed .
with his music , which often deals with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world .
with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his mind , and he can sympath@@ ise with the people who suffer from the disa@@ strous consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not openly admit it , he har@@ ms a special reluc@@ t@@ ance against US foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , have anything to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees of the second generation , &quot; he den@@ otes himself , even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think so because of my own living circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so because I am a human being &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he poured in water sol@@ dered Nes@@ cafÃ© in two cups . it &apos;s the holy month Ram@@ adan , in that time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a sen@@ sing hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the mu@@ cks speak lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the ra@@ kes of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose primarily of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air , especially when one thro@@ ws a glance into neighbouring countries .
therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan - drink water - in order not to land in jail .
recently , the interior ministry of Jordan has announced a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian Bran@@ ch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual front @-@ singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o contradic@@ ts the country &apos;s cultural and traditional norms and the main reason for the concert evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pu@@ ties and former press secretary of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been cancelled because of the singer &apos;s sexual orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many also claim that the band &apos;s commitment in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which puts the old @-@ proven legitim@@ acy of authorit@@ arian regimes in the entire region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la appreciated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to advoc@@ ate for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement probably should not be shallow rhet@@ oric , but in fact reflect an increasingly clear cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b retired traditional gender norms by educ@@ ating his vision of the fate of Arab women having pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently tr@@ ampl@@ ed unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust .
in recent years , the number of &apos; Hon@@ orary Mor@@ de &apos; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside of the country .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of Hon@@ orary Mor@@ de reached its zen@@ ith in 2016 ; however , it is even more difficult that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way .
according to a crime law on crime in 1954 , women who are exposed to the risk of domestic violence can &quot; remain in prison in@@ definitely , &quot; and for their release there is often a long @-@ term bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee on the part of the family that nothing will happen to the woman .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from issues that have long been tab@@ oo in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was informed about politics , &quot; he says .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b tackl@@ es the question of Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are political at the core can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse repeatedly repe@@ ats itself :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of the song , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market in which , in his words , &quot; that can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ gen@@ eity or homosexu@@ ality .
he noted that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of ga@@ ys and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals were still cens@@ ored up until 2014 .
in 2014 H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya in order to later notice that his comments were torn out of context , distorted and his opinion had been cens@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Youtube , it was uploaded without cuts , but was only a edited version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b acqu@@ ires openly for the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als does not correspond to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , which still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ what , who should work later on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the H@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom there is nothing new anymore that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian intelligence service established several former government officials and members of the teacher association , argu@@ ing that they were critical of the problems linked to the corruption @-@ rooted corruption in comment@@ aries on social media .
in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
Jordan has prevented M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - this is H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thought and inner changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
ultimately , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without any intervention from abroad .
he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of &quot; experiencing it . &quot;
perhaps the region will be approached with a genuine and fundamental openness by means of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions , and artificial demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes that .
until the time has come , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and consequently resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ or dolls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
one suppos@@ es that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the ar@@ mo@@ ons , drums , and dancing come from a time when armies of West Japan mar@@ ched into the north @-@ east to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , to its knees .
we are at Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to snap some great seats , so we have a super view .
one can hardly imagine how big these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) .
I have been looking for the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time now : two fe@@ e@@ ders are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and yet another breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ uch@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 @-@ metre @-@ tall compact car was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

outer appearances and body care were rarely so important as in this story , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate profession as those of the hair@@ dresser .
El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are everyday .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - experienced an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to more and more regular citizens to go into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers that can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the dres@@ sings of the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 .
there experts compete against each other to show who of them can create the most ec@@ centric look , as you can see in the following video ( more videos about current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to persu@@ ade young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to get an education in the hair@@ dressing art instead of poor advice that allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the possibilities that offer , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the school year which began in March and reported some of its successes :
in 1995 we were the only school in the community and the district , which we are very proud of , because of love for the children we have built up this educational community .
Colombia : love Let@@ ters to guer@@ illa fighters

&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the article entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lovers of guer@@ illa fighters &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; published by the international online magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
isn &apos;t it even more important to accommodate people who feel vent@@ ured to counter@@ act affection ?
this was exactly the question of the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ ra@@ ga of the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la ar@@ li@@ aciÃ³n ( Let@@ ters to Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ liation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
only recently their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part to it : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government signed a peace treaty with the guer@@ ri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Defense Forces of Colombia ) , which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
internationally , the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian President JosÃ© Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services .
before the Colum@@ bi@@ ans , however , there is still a long way until one can speak of real reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters who have lived in illegal detention for many years , exposed to a war rhet@@ oric and carrying out their weapons around the clock , must now re @-@ integrate into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , which had accustomed itself to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , must now take it into its ranks and support it in building a new life .
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bi@@ ans had to join together and help in the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back into society .
the goal of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters who are to be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to talk briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more .
he plans to share his love with people this year , who needed the most urgent response .
so the plan was to write letters of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now have to find their place in society and build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
up to now , more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ .
&apos;@@ i never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on March 19th .
a group of 40 students of the University Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bog@@ ota traveled to the camp to personally transfer the letters .
the members of the F@@ ARC set up as they had done earlier in order to accept the orders of their leaders .
but this time they received no commands , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything between them , &quot; said the political student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former warri@@ or led me through the camp of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters live ) I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ Gran@@ at@@ laun@@ cher , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty Battle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hello , what are they doing right now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am answering a letter that someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very beautiful and hop@@ eful letter .
never in my life has someone written something so beautiful , that &apos;s why I answer it . &quot; suddenly tears ran to me about the che@@ eks .
I hu@@ g@@ ged him completely and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
perhaps he was also tired of the war , was sorry to be all the years of faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life as a war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers before star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside there waiting for us with open arms .
so far I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
but now where peace prev@@ ails , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new Vo@@ ices
to begin with , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC agreed to a discussion .
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC already acted in secret .
for this reason , the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organisation , their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the State imp@@ acted upon the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can help shape society in this country just more equ@@ itable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of them said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
those people who have never heard hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I often seen as monsters and even hated even people with beautiful feelings that have been turned around by their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me .
but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ Ã­@@ o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i , following letter :
the Colom@@ bian was prophes@@ ied that after the dis@@ armament peace would rule .
but this is not the case .
as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people willing to take up arms , rise up and protest for their rights . and that is also fully justified ( ... ) .
we of the F@@ ARC are now putting on peace , on a policy without weapons .
therefore , we call upon all the def@@ enders of peace - no matter which race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will endure many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

hom@@ os@@ exual and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers such as discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with terror , activists have witnessed the reporting of recent months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the threat that hangs over the LG@@ BT@@ Q community above the local LG@@ BT@@ Q community has not been created overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual wife from Gro@@ z@@ y who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the republic .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines several months ago after reports have been published that address the deportation , torture and killing que@@ er men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who captured que@@ er men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have brought a monster to the world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans @-@ woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
since her childhood she felt she was actually a woman .
when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow .
after a group had experienced Ch@@ ech@@ ens of the sex equ@@ ation of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
out of fear for her life she ultimately moved to the USA .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from D@@ age@@ stan , a trans @-@ woman who was in trouble .
she had no money so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them everywhere on the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can remove this shame ? &quot;
after that the photos of my documents took the lap through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked .
when I was doing a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here &apos;s a gift for you from your unc@@ le . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you still honor the family , you Sh@@ and@@ stain ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital at the end of the day .
apparently , some women had brought everything together and started to scre@@ am .
the man had fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two cat@@ ches in my right lung .
OC Media : in which ambul@@ ances were you placed - in which of the men or the women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
I am very thank@@ ful for that .
when I read his name for the first time at his office , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out as a good person .
I am grateful to him for being respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month at the hospital .
last February I got threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they asked me to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all was a lie .
they set absurd demands : some said to me that I must prove it by running above without through the streets ; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Gro@@ z@@ ny and say that I had not changed my gender , that all was only bad talk , and Photos@@ hop .
I have KÃ¶r@@ mend size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some elderly people once spoke my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world , which has corrupted not only your family , but the whole Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we can &apos;t touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my mother was too much , and she lay down a rope around his neck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
fortunately the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number plate with a 95 mm plate under the window .
after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that something was la@@ zy .
my human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you work ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to reveal their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help I left the country , but then something unexpected happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought them without registering , without ID , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage .
arrived and checked in the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I received a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe , you &apos;re sure , just because you have left the country ?
our people already know in which hotel you plug . you even know your room number .
just to prove it to you : it is number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we do not talk about gender equality , that is a tab@@ oo subject .
some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian items still carry me in me .
as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera , I really don &apos;t give any trouble to look at the person they remember from their past - in other words , my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who have been d@@ ort@@ aged ?
Sab@@ rina : last week I submitted a report to Washington .
for him I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who had been in the gun for a half and a half months .
he told that no people were arrested and tor@@ tured during Ram@@ adan , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not shut up a new wave .
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
in doing so , I mean , they probably invite relatives , these take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end they require evidence that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are there still gay men arrested in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there would not be so many .
if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to face Kad@@ y@@ rov &apos;s judgment .
as far as I know , they are held there , so that they can later be presented as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim that they have attacked any village or a military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , but deliberately sub@@ merged in order to radic@@ alise .
OC Media : is this only a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown .
there has been nothing new from them ever since .
they just took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself when these people were taken .
until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there were no reports yet . we suspect that such actions are possible .
why else would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know whether these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation already took place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known all over Gro@@ z@@ ny , when I still lived there - and I never had any problems .
in serious !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was considered , I had never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
Russia was originally intended to bring us to the &quot; Ci@@ vili@@ zation , &quot; but in the end it has thrown us back into the Stone Age .
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had dy@@ ed eyel@@ ashes , wore tub@@ ular jeans and short tops .
the security ministry of Sh@@ aria has never cur@@ bed me even a hair .
before the Russian Theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met .
it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we have never been offen@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ie not over the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is often said to be children , when people make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were ill ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never offen@@ ded me , never hun@@ ted and never struck .
OC Media : how long did this time of grace stop ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ rov stepped on the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began talking about morality on television .
he did not speak about us per se , but primarily about the behavior of women .
nevertheless , one could feel how people began to change in the city .
those who had smil@@ ed and laugh@@ ed beforehand looked at you at once with suspici@@ on .
in the meantime I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home I could feel how the situation in the Republic deterior@@ ated steadily .
OC Media : which activity do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ws , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get food cards .
I don &apos;t have a c@@ ents for it for a long time .
I discovered these people myself when I picked up some species of breeding .
I am Muslim and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ den@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s sil@@ ly .
so nature is , it has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens who want to prophes@@ y with foam in front of the mouth that there are no ga@@ ys with them .
the ro@@ dents have which the Cab@@ ard@@ ins have , the Russians have also which ; on the whole planet they exist , but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear such things .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
you know , many think of transi@@ ence to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be exact , different life settings .
for me , it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry I &apos;m so personally here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all , I simply know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase of suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab ancest@@ or community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the last months there is a strong increase in suicide .
the photograph of Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 drew the desperate situation of the Arab ancest@@ or community in Iran , which is marked by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness to be able to rise to his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and want to remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had kind@@ led himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could not do anything any more .
he died short time later .
it was not the only suicide which happened in August in the Arab ancest@@ or minority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take their lives .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have been imposed .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers who felt hel@@ pless and in@@ capable of nour@@ ishing their families and doing a safe work because of the persecution from the Iranian government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Arab &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ah@@ wa@@ zi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot; &quot; &quot;
the region in which most of the Arab ancest@@ or community living in Iran has been sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to deny their livel@@ ihood .
a century ago , the Arab ancest@@ or was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy took over power and in 1925 took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable agricultural areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population receives only little from this wealth .
it is often victim of untreated diseases , hunger and priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime has been systematically ref@@ using the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Arabs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s that diver@@ t water from the Arab territories into the Persian areas , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie .
these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen@@ ing the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness in the region , and destroying local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industries .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ k young@@ sters has increased to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director of co@@ operatives , work and social welfare , stated that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job , completed the primary school , 55 % completed a secondary school and 45 % have university degrees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian human rights activ@@ ist living in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men .
for this reason , a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination .
since function@@ aries and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers , the local Arab ancest@@ or is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livel@@ ihood outside their home country of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their first name and sur@@ name to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and thus be hired , since even Arab names are not tolerated at the workplace , let alone the speech of the Arabic language or the wearing of Arabic clothes .
in view of the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi has to endure , human rights activ@@ ist alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking notice of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is prev@@ ent@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I don &apos;t identify myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the statement published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as website .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a femin@@ ist and why we should generally be all feminine * inside .
for example , despite the same education , women still earn less money than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms always make sure that women sooner or later encounter a glass ceiling in various areas of life and that discrimination based on sex is still spreading across the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced and I am suffering double and triple .
I am a black woman .
and yet : if I come to talk on skin colour , on racism , on black women women , black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been mis@@ used in racial se@@ gregation and discrimination , both in and out of femin@@ ist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to remain silent .
however , they all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift up their voices and to sing &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; to achieve equality ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to talk about that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is an institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist @-@ motivated violence , that we are exposed to black women in two ways .
or that black women and women of other ethnic groups and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with mig@@ r@@ atory backgrounds are often referred to school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that women in black spheres and women with migrant backgrounds are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of any skin colour to have the same rights ; on the other hand , as a black woman , I cannot join a movement in which the white woman stands , who refuses to take into account in@@ equi@@ ties in her mind , referring to the gender as well as the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained in her speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman in a historical sense is a de@@ mented and margin@@ alized being . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropri@@ ation in order to drive their eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c program forward .
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overl@@ apping skin color and gender . for some of them continue to silence the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them a better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different origins a home and differenti@@ ate themselves from the white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name .
I prefer to release myself completely from femin@@ ism and join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of using myself for a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradigm that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana possibly : claims ( for example : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : as we rec@@ laim ourselves ) speaks of the fact that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces where they can be completely safe and in which the cultural , mental , emotional , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped that make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself of the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the femin@@ ist movement that the black woman is concerned .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women from other cultures , for in this paradigm I exist .
I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment in which my life neither passed , nor ignored , nor refused .
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this post by To@@ d@@ d Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here again .
again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled to Iraq in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern of the Kurdist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains to us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a kid , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the NGO Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summar@@ ises the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and edited for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , Iraq @-@ based documentary film and multimedia journalist .
the focus of her work is on persecuted , little attention @-@ grab@@ bing sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of co @-@ operative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with the help of supp@@ ressed communities that can tell their stories in their own way .
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women portra@@ ys &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain over women &apos;s mur@@ ders in the country and the region and to show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Ag@@ ainst Women in Paraguay &quot; by Kur@@ tural . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # female ) reported on the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected people .
a police inspec@@ tor told A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ member , who had become violent against her .
since the end of their relationship some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done .
when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena due to mal@@ treatment , A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez &apos;s accurate display of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez did nothing .
a few days later the second woman res@@ um@@ ed her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
women generally do not receive support from the State .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence should contact the law enforcement authorities at all .
content 1 pun@@ ches and statistics 2 un@@ seen abuse and a legal system that does not compromise 3 Paraguay &apos;s laws : good approach , lack of implementation impacts and statistics
it is hard to determine how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ Studios , a socio @-@ scientific research institute in Paraguay . &quot; there are various information and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
however , the numbers available are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , 9@@ 600 advertisements for domestic violence took place in the District At@@ tor@@ ney Office . 70 % of these were violence against women .
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 advertisements due to domestic violence in the peace courts . 86 % of the ads of women came here as well .
in the ads 40 % of women said they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; on every woman , who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay for psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of 2014 , two women who do not do this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not a separate crime , the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 alone , journalists included at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country .
the co @-@ ordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to her estimates , every ten days in Paraguay dies by men due to violence .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that under@@ takes nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z became the solid friend of Carlos Vera , he insist@@ ed that she named him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning , she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then after . this should always repent .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos . but for two years she inherited the psychological violence on his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult one :
I never thought that I would be a victim of abuse .
when I read about it , I always thought that only women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they let themselves be fo@@ ol@@ ed by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse caused by Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote articles on Facebook where she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she liked the so long of Carlos and didn &apos;t leave him earlier .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least would have a certain complic@@ ity .
Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner ab@@ used her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ o te Cre@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; network ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) composed of women , all of whom are victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case , everything started with psychological abuse .
her aff@@ lu@@ ent partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Victoria &apos;s ads with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , they received no support .
it led a process against its former partner , who developed into an un@@ man@@ age@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of their former partner .
Paraguay &apos;s laws : good approach , lack of implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the abuse of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
a draft bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament on 10 August 2016 , known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # Prince ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os Movement ( # Non@@ on@@ ess ) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law stipul@@ ates that fem@@ inists declare to be an independent criminal off@@ ence and to punish har@@ sh@@ er as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the legislative text was changed in some ways in order to also gain de@@ pu@@ ties for the law that feared that the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions is banned , currently banned in Paraguay and is pun@@ ish@@ able by up to five years &quot; imprisonment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the original draft law had provided the majority of ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs , which must bear the victims of violence at present themselves , if they simply furnis@@ h an ad and would like to receive a safe accommodation to impose the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it : &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Paraguay , mal@@ treatment is seen as a part of inter@@ personal relationships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here a re@@ thinking must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who is silent in the face of these facts , makes himself guilty and contributes to the fact that the offen@@ ders get away stra@@ igh@@ ta@@ way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must reimbur@@ se for such a long time until mi@@ stre@@ ated is no longer considered to be normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate was adopted . previously , parts of the law had been changed . among other things , a passage was canc@@ eled , calling the partners in cases of domestic violence to reconci@@ le .
opinions on the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the cancellation of words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from parts of the law is considered a major set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media in Oman one year after the ban on a newspaper still exposed to attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was closed on the basis of a resolution of the Information Minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is read on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Japanese authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for their reporting on corruption in the Sult@@ an .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison where he served a one @-@ year prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and tried , but later released .
Oman has been ruled by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after losing his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat .
since then , along with his role as the only sult@@ an , he has held the most important positions in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sult@@ an &apos;s rule is characterized by the persistent efforts of the security forces , especially domestic secret services , civil liber@@ ties , including press freedom , clos@@ ets and human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists to torture , intim@@ id@@ ate and det@@ ach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights systematically and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the attack on Az@@ am@@ n , their closure and the imprisonment of three of their editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper which has been reported since its inc@@ eption in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties to bind the hands of justice &quot; in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 .
in the report , government officials were accused of having pressur@@ ized judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to impose a judgment in an inheritance dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n from July 26 , 2016 with a report on the front page with the heading : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind the hands of justice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the editorial committee , was invited by the ISS to the special department and arrested on his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , ISS played the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief , You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper was prohibited on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i took place in Mas@@ k@@ at on 26 September 2016 .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned , among other things , to distur@@ b@@ ance of public order , &quot; abuse of the internet , &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the pres@@ tige of the state . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of viol@@ ating a prohibition of publication and of slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of imprisonment and fin@@ es of 3,000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . moreover , a year @-@ old ban was imposed on the two journalists .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year of imprisonment and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of the use of an information network to spread material that could pose a threat to public order .
for Al @-@ Abr@@ i a security deposit of 5000 U.S. Ri@@ al ( 13@@ 000 US dollars ) was set and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the Appe@@ als Court cleared Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari sentenced to six months in prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after the loss of his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ k@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he served his one @-@ year prison sentence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Appe@@ als Court also raised the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the court &apos;s decision to admit Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper still faces attacks by the government of the United States .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of Az@@ am@@ n was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and with which the Minister introduced himself another time against the decision of the Appe@@ als Court to restore the publication of the newspaper .
the permanent closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where the freedom of the press was viol@@ ated in Oman in recent times .
further injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation .
due to the permanent closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ ani authorities are still not ready to end the extensive violation of the freedom of the press .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) demands :
1 . liber@@ ate You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j promptly and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2 . create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3 . to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . in all circumstances , to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have un@@ hin@@ dered their legitimate human rights work without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation measures , including legal har@@ ass@@ ment .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( including independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and the right to gather , support and protect themselves peac@@ efully .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or even mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on site : on the one hand , many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent are missing .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more serious implications in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment in the investigation of these diseases by the phar@@ ma companies is a major problem .
secondly , research carried out by African scientists is helping to build their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role in science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Central Laboratory at the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , in the 1990s , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic showed the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus before deciding to go back home to support the Serbian health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about the mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( disclaim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment , the focus of my work is on the application of research results . in doing so , I support the Serbian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I just started a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
GV : what do you think of the important current science topics in your country and in Africa in general ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always remain a receiver instead of being a maker yourself .
the solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GV : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are promoted differently .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here because funding and development chances are better in other countries .
GV : what is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research work you don &apos;t have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GV : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is already an interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , exploration of space , health care ( non @-@ communic@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GV : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of living as a scientist in Africa vis @-@ Ã  @-@ vis western countries based on your experience ?
RW : often it &apos;s the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that challenges challenges .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system that magazines can only make articles accessible against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pay@@ back &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) limits the amount of information available and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website of En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mort@@ on has been cultiv@@ ating salad in the USA since the 1980s .
his company offers 114 sorts , such as Out@@ lan@@ geous , the first plant that has been grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was limited only by its own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many salad kinds he can get .
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding .
the patents applied not only for individual types , but also for certain properties , such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or ch@@ ained leaves .
over the past few years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as crop or car@@ rot varieties . based on this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of old tradition , Mort@@ on always gre@@ ets let@@ tu@@ ce , but he needs longer since his work becomes more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s as if in a river a b@@ oul@@ der is lying to which I have to p@@ addle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we must do that now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that these patents go too far on salads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand in court , nobody can breed a new kind of salad , because all the features are already patented . &quot; so he goes on as well as possible and tries to breed those features that he wants .
however , he is very careful and stri@@ ves to not use any material protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the US and anywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red ro@@ asts of the Out@@ sh@@ utter variety in the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; of the station . there , it is tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is not by chance that this name sounds rather as if the movement comes from the IT sphere and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; open source &quot; seeds ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
it was created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus are permanently usable for plant breeders .
as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US breeders can undertake to freely use the seed they have bred .
this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and they can sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders only allow others to breed their seeds to breed their own varieties , and not immediately sow - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
for the Professor at the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i @-@ Management Board , Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control of seed and the ability to breed new plants is important for food security and environmental protection .
according to seed , seed plays a role in greater coher@@ ence , such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphasizes that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not deal with genetically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seed , &quot; he says , and takes on the increasingly common mer@@ gers in the global agricultural industry , whose recent examples are the mer@@ gers of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Mon@@ san@@ to and Bayer . &quot; those who want to buy good , locally and sustain@@ ably produced vegetables should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed initiative are committed to making their seed available free of charge . thus , their approach is contrary to patent seed and plant characteristics .

O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered as the available gene pool , due to the ever increasing intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always available , shr@@ inks continuously .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has engaged in her PhD work with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all the car@@ rot characteristics are protected as intellectual property , making it impossible for plant breeders to use either at all or only complic@@ at@@ edly .
for other plants , there are no such estimates , but experts such as Lu@@ by suspect that large @-@ scale crops such as wheat are patented in even bigger style than let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots .
a question of perspective
plants are bred in such a way that they have specific desirable characteristics - from those through which their taste or colour improves to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and can withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing through more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the altered conditions are much worse predic@@ tible by climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Agricultural Ministry of the United States , the company is committed to maintaining genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it contradic@@ ts , however , that intellectual property has other breeders &apos; clos@@ ets , since &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expi@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to get the same result using another method .
such protection does not in@@ hibit innovations , but rather encourages them to provide more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
Mort@@ on looks different : 20 years to wait until a patent exp@@ ires , he certainly does not promote innovations .
and if you have to wait so long to breed plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you have already lost the fight .
however , the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain : &quot; independent plant breeders do not have the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive for us .
we want to facilitate their work to farmers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what motiv@@ ates us , and it is impossible for us to continue using the best and most recent genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in total Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept of pat@@ enting plant characteristics : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really create the features ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plants form themselves and as a bree@@ der we have no idea how the plants do that .
a mystery of nature . &quot;
for Caro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant breeders in the US state of O@@ reg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; he who breeds a variety breeds his own values in her .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , for whose cultivation it needs to be used masses of herds , breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is just contrary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to ) have patents , they create most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case .
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mort@@ on is looking for salads in his breeding garden .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Mort@@ on also believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it looks like I &apos;m working with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I constantly need new material for my catalogue , because I know that my ri@@ vals will sell my varieties for a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent you are protected against competition for 20 years , making it very easy for my opinion . &quot; worldwide resonance
although the US seems to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , implements a &quot; open source &quot; seed programme . to preserve the seeds of traditional crops , the Centre works with farmers and helps them breed new varieties that meet certain requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German organisation Agre@@ col is working on an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i obligation for breeders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( regulations for breeding differ from country to country , therefore the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot simply be adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declares that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able , thus speaking against the current practice of the European Patent Office that allows patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants .
however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is in the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the pat@@ enting of seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; Programme for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , for which the official start signal should be scheduled next year .
a combination of environmental protection and development assistance groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has put together a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a report in September . it believes that farmers have the opportunity to come to seed , to exchange and improve the seed policy so that stable supply of food can be ensured .
the report also highlights the importance of a diverse local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a context that Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes that more people will soon be recognized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has mainly taken care of where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that even more is behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest cens@@ orship goals in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities are still blocking content on the internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ GE@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports about the above .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in August , the network published a statement on Facebook in which it sharply critici@@ zed the Egyptian authorities and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Arabic network for Human Rights information remains true despite this attack and the ridi@@ cul@@ ation of the Egyptian right and the constitution by the authorities who should defend the law , to expose the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world . even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals , it has never been as important as it is now .
AN@@ GE@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era network from Qatar for alleged &quot; support for terrorism . &quot;

in addition to AN@@ ICA@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the distribution of columns and articles that he writes for websites and media not accessible to Egypt .
now the blog , which he set up to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , became the target of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider in which also Zi@@ adas blog is given a home , on the other hand , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video about how the police exercised physical violence against two students .
his articles mainly revol@@ ve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada vo@@ iced himself to the blocking by the government and reflected what this meant for him :
to lock blogs is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and although the block of blogs may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) It is possible for them to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege ; an arrest , an attempted murder , sum@@ mons to the National Security Council , the blocking of blogs as well as any other website for which I was working .
2 ) They have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words : my words have influence , albeit only to a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used to post items to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship .
but now that they have locked him and that they &apos;re afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the brave move the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Ex@@ pression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August . this resulted in technical tests on networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , V@@ od@@ af@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at .
af@@ te also documented the block@@ age of providers , through which Internet cens@@ orship and private surfing was possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
she reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12th we noticed how the blocking of web pages that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offered began .
such a practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter contents on which Egyptian users could have access .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation is additionally wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are taken behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis with which it can act in court against these actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .
the Brazilian army was deployed in the fav@@ el@@ as in Nit@@ er@@ Ã³@@ i , a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro , during the government crisis .

day after day newspapers in whole of Brazil report dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old was shot in school , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves ro@@ b pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tim@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Navy and air af@@ ee to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ government organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become common and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; known for detailed coverage of violence in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which it announced a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the newspaper explained the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city on the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual abuse , etc . everything , however , devi@@ ates from the civili@@ sed standard and what happens only in Rio , will be published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative , so that as journalists , we do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , stated that this decision was not a cause for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war at all .
in the same video , a newspaper journalist explains that according to the Institute of Internal Security Studies in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the paper continues :
we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distorted , can also be used to obsc@@ ure the atro@@ cities of the police , who only shoots and then asks questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; War &quot; har@@ ms more than it benefits ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , ar@@ gues that violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is in their opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to account@@ ability in the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as it has shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ compl@@ acent negl@@ ect of public service .
as a reminder , the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than only its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most violent place in Brazil &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is wrong : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the latest available data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we look at the mur@@ ders per state , Rio is on No@@ .@@ 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
extra belongs to Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , like Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for years .
these security policies also included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit imposed by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer a fav@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police custody and permanently station@@ ing a unit there .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent death cases . for a number of years , however , after several reports about har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit , the U@@ PP was increasingly under attack .
on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ Ã£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles from the year 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also draws serious consequences for human beings .
this requires the state to use resources and ways that are typical of war . this includes intru@@ sion into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a Zi@@ vi@@ ist is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; irr@@ ored balls . &quot;
war hin or forth , the fact is that the residents of the fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio .
a week it is now time for the police to cl@@ en@@ ch the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ ar@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : Syrians learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades primarily by the Assad regime towards loyal troops .
according to victories World@@ watch , a joint initiative of the peace organisation PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , are in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ li@@ b currently about one million Syrians in a state of siege .
the East Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly affected when an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition are assuming that the Assad regime &apos;s massacre was perpet@@ rated by the United Nations and other human rights organisations .
since 2013 , these areas controlled by rebel forces outside of Damascus have been under siege , leading to the fact that local residents are instructed locally or through tunnels and control points .
through the years of block@@ ages , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a return , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of Eastern Gh@@ out@@ as how they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; food @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
fung@@ i do not belong to the common foods planted in Syria and are only rarely part of the Syrian kitchen . however , their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed east Gh@@ out@@ a .
the Direc@@ tion of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we chose to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expressed his relief that it is now more and more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gaining popularity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to give 125 families knowledge of planting mushrooms , says Dr. Lei@@ la zu Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12.@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ do until Monday , the 4th of September 2017 .
the initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel shortage , locally produced fuels are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they started &quot; production of mushrooms &quot; from the regions before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption .
then they planted a small mushroom grav@@ eyard in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tank . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after 3 months they have spread fung@@ i everywhere in the East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom cultivation for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : breaking the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency , by using food residue ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new foods .
creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are tied to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea throughout the world so that our success and our fight against hunger and siege will become visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Portuguese demand justice for the victims of 2017 &quot; &quot; &quot;
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many district capital cities in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires that r@@ amp@@ aged in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government proclaimed a state of state last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
bran@@ dies were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain , where there were 4 dead persons .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire breaks spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forest monitoring system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite photos , around 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can get a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .

numerous videos spread on the net and show images that allow better insights into what is happening :
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
the aim of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wondered why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ Ã£o Sover@@ al from the Con@@ federation of farmers of Portugal declared the paper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
according to Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of open streets surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have happened in June as the streets were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned .
a far @-@ reaching proposal on the turn of the forest , which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law which allowed building activity from case to case if the applicant had funds for self @-@ defence - that was an open back door , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jo@@ Ã£o Sor@@ val in the same article of the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of readily inflamm@@ able wood , become , as in a vi@@ cious circle , spread further on in fires of this kind .
these problems are caused by the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when people sought information or tried to contact relatives , offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : they used their own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by Jo@@ Ã£o P@@ ina &apos;s developer in order to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was so crucial on this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers didn &apos;t stand up to the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users that followed the fires : the website counted more than half a million hits .
even the founder asked for help :

the way from Afghanistan to a successful entrepren@@ eur

in one night in the fall of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
two years before , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . Afghanistan has become a country of terror and despair .
exactly at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , has spent the last time together with his family at dinner in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan .
even if his mother did not say it then , she knew that she would not see her son for a long time - maybe never again .
at dawn the boy should break .
his unc@@ le would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

Ab@@ du@@ l Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e Wah@@ habi party , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess .
the Taliban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af res@@ ig@@ ned in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal pit . the work was difficult and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his low wages , and went to Iran . once again , he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and drag@@ ged sacks with mort@@ ars which were heavier than himself , in order to earn his livel@@ ihood .
at the time of today , Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran were characterized by misery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af rec@@ alled in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we also worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no services and no heating there . we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we did not freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and landed on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ eh came to Italy in 2002 .
some time , A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church twice a day distributed food to needy people .
true , Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high acceptance rates . it is true , however , that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers find in the country are disa@@ strous .
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers are housed in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian law asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially placed an application for asylum - which can still be drawn after the registration of the asylum application for months .
until then , people who don &apos;t have money for an accommodation can either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ restra@@ ined thread of life helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
after several years of working in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice .
this went so well that after a while , he opened a second hostel and a snack bar .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now subject to the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are only a few of the obstacles .
according to the official estimates , some 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years some Afgh@@ ans run businesses , including dres@@ s@@ making , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the dining card of the restaurant tells the story of her trip to Italy through the different Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes .
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the restaurant peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ qi &apos;s objectives extend far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and the retail trade and aim back to the country which he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where a risk is , there are also possibilities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily if I know my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af also for@@ ges plans to open a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end there is stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this road .
citizen report : bill dra@@ fts from Egypt enable the dis@@ connection of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in custody .
he reported on the clearing of the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya camp in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the de@@ composition of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ tizen Report is an international snapshot that illustrates challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights
the Egyptian parliament reviews a bill that fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after a registration with a government authority .
users would have to register to use social networks within six months following a successful legislative decision on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and ID number .
those who miss this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or the enti@@ t@@ lement of a pen@@ al payment .
the law , which was promoted by sixty members of parliament , is currently ahead of the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May , another member of Parliament submitted a legislative proposal to be introduced in the tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the ins@@ ult of the President or a high officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the law proposition , such action would , however , be punished with prison and fin@@ es , as legal experts of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law is passed , this may mean up to three years imprisonment for the convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photograph@@ ed Egyptian polic@@ emen while demonstrating violence against prot@@ esters who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of elected president Mohamed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting , as more than 700 protest participants , who had been arrested at the same incident , four years in detention to a trial date .
recently his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May because according to human rights groups , the prison management failed to bring the defend@@ ants from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threatened the death penalty as a result of one , so many human rights groups agree , include a floo@@ ding of arms , illegal assembly , murder , and attempted murder .
in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iza presented the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting on the pro @-@ Mor@@ si session block at Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the Court also reduced the punishment of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the aforementioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunisi@@ an activists inter@@ cep@@ ted to scanned documents
in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who co @-@ founded the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly inter@@ rog@@ ated with an in@@ ert plan of action . said Plan comes from the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , explicitly supports a controversial bill of bills which would ensure the business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption if they return all un@@ justi@@ fi@@ ably preserved funds .
the document published on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at on April 21 , casts a light on how the preventive plans for supporting the bill look like .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the mention of his sources under specification of Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press code , which journalists have the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he appeared in the district court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness .
will China force the users of social media to submit their identification ?
according to the new provisions of the Information Bureau of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need permission before they write or share messages in social media .
in the provisions , it is also stated that registration will be required with the full real name .
analysts assume that by doing so , the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks should be reached . it is unclear to date how the authorities will apply these rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to enforce these regulations only selective in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and independence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; do we see ourselves in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
not in Russia !
in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register with the State Government as the &quot; organis@@ er of the dissemination of information . &quot;
this term is part of a law from the year 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for removing content and to force them on request to susp@@ end user data .
these web pages currently include websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ xi@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the email service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court has ban Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ordered the Wiki@@ pedi@@ as ban in Turkey , after Wikipedia ad@@ ministers refused to clear two English @-@ language articles , the particulars , Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication abandoned the site because it became &quot; a source of information that collabor@@ ates with groups to join a political diffusion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is therefore , among other things , China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
UK may not cease to sni@@ ff
after this week @-@ fed documents , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor programs that dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services with regard to the proposal , but has launched other technology companies and the civilian population outside .
despite all this , the consultation runs until May 19 . reactions and suggestions on the part of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior .
