<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, listened to American music, read American authors and run his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly a journalist because of an American movie.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, covered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate, who wanted to occupy the supreme federal court with judges who were inclined to his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free to Method Man," "" "I was as if this is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona had only reinforced my admiration for the United States.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said, "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it's easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had written a very blackish love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then came Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how to deal with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops in his opinion on the mountain, as you say so nicely.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague expressed it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, the people have responded to his statements and tuned in pairs for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican preselection was the highest number ever achieved by the party nominee.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigoted person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't reconcile Trump and his electors with the people I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">Like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, which takes people from all over the world, a deeply believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, Trumps Weltanschauung did not agree with the present editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer," the present editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the" "" "Phoenix Suns" "" "at the game." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fought for the environment for a long time, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits the engagement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wiser advice helped me a lot during my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values represented by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump broke his way to the Republican presidential candidate, she offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">It turned out, however, that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly whites, the presidency, gave a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump because they shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters as Rassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful, and indicates an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of whom have voted for Trump, because they want to regain control of a country they have disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say they are still important in America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, you can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commits the cruel decision to raise a man looking down with contempt on those who look different than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "Whitelash" "" "(OB.: as much as" "" "referring to the whites against all other ethnicities" "" "; word play in white in allusion to the Whites and Whiplash, which means so much like Schleudertrauma), as the big Van Jones described, has killed exactly what America has made so great." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world value the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - what faith or background one may have, America is welcome everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyanist, whose story as he himself says nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election of Donald Trumps, however, a huge part of America's white America promises this promise and says: to Hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "the crowd answered with a loud" "" "no!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "roared the crowd." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "have Latinos a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried, and their voices became louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "would anyone who is not like you, a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a unanimous and loud" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, that is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land for which his son was fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is Trumps Land now, the message said.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan might find no place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>
<seg id="68">Picture of Flickr user OEA-OAS (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0).</seg>
<seg id="69">What did the Mexican Music School of the Vicente Guerrero community in the Oaxaca province share with the children of the Paraguaean city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">The fact that the music played at both places has not only changed the lives of children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music, which lives with the trash</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca and # 8212; an old colonial town which is very popular among tourists - but worlds away from the nearby preColumbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now, the La banda de Música (music gang) plays in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, located in one of Mexico's poorest provinces, is known for its drug abuse and gangs violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot, who launched a musical project and offered a rare hope for the youth.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI writes:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They come always laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the hustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, Piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, Waldhorn, Pauline, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Waste</seg>
<seg id="82">The children of Cateura play more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero - a village that is practically on the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprocessed instruments made of local solid waste materials produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers began to convert pieces of waste into instruments under the direction of Favio Chávez.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments mimic violin, viola, cellos, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all made of the trash.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and musical teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the early days:</seg>
<seg id="87">At first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage. the children didn't know any music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a violin produced from waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra that plays instruments from reprocessed material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentation called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic Müllerponie) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces about one billion tons of rubbish every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with Him and from Him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they transform it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">The Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played its music before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries demonstrate how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports about international, practical solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">Re-publishing takes place as part of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">Back then in West Africa, it was known that this ship had already run illegal fishing in Liberian waters before it looked for the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a breakwater of this species on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comes, Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to launch one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly, the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything," "" "Remember Benedict Kiilu, a leading employee of the Kenyan Fisheries Authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at that time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it was unable to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the end, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of looting the fish stocks of the country.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and safeguards resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 founded by NRO Stop Illegal fishing (Illegal Fisheries Stop).</seg>
<seg id="107">In addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries, who then had expelled the prime minister from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "we have eight countries that are like minded and work together. they exchange information and stand together for illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charitable Trust Project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project provides FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to detect. thus illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">The deliberate disregard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected can harm the illegal fishing ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">However, while actions against illegal fishing were hampered by bureaucratic obstacles, and also through the snail pace that circulated information between individual countries, the actions happen nowadays in real time, with trackable at FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also closely monitors the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in prohibited areas. also, suspicious routes may be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship loads the caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">In an ideal case, such investigations can show whether the involved ships have a fishing licence, where they were on the road and possibly also if they have a penal code.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such vessels in their ports, which means that ships cannot sell their cargo, and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "it is about significant financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is not worthwhile financially." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and that's what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, head of NFDS Africa." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The previously mentioned platform was created to recover an estimated 20 million USD in lost revenue, which are losing the eight members of the HISH-i network every year because of the illegal fishermen that enter into East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, therefore the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Among other things, actions include sailing under false flag, fake licence documents, specification of fantasies, fish protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non-complete organized control system," "" "says Long." "" "in the past, a ship could fishing illegally and a country could say" "" "You can't start my harbor." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. 'and exactly this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used multiple fraudulent identities and it has tracked and found escaping ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority for combating crime, FISH-i can share and preserve information on illegal fishing across great distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, helps to detect the illegal ships that like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fishermen use highly sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position," "" "says Duncan Copeland, Chief Analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NGO that also deals with fishery data and provides technical support for FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">For example, some of the ships switch off their automatic identification systems, so they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland helps build a system that combines different levels of information with each other. FISH-i will help to find criminal-acting ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">Yet FISH-i's team of African nations can actually influence the unquestionable global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NGO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Marine Protection Organization Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by means of the position of each tracking ship in the world.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "join with the neighbours to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources for investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this at a global level." "" "" "" "Pew Charitable Trust has a similar project in which a global system allows the persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities do not only detect criminals but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that used to confiscate without licence and had hardly reckoned with consequences, know now that they are being observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i have now reached a 33% increase in fishery sales since fishing boats buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i had helped to track Greko 1, the inspectors found towing nets where they were banned.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that now also other countries are copying," "" "says Kiilu." "" "we are a study object." "" "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars annually disappear by illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">"" "there, six countries joined forces in 2015 to go to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they are now fighting illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i." "" "safety is the goal of even more such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions," "" "says Copeland." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently FISH-i's youngest member country Somalia was able to announce its first big triumph: in October, it made Greko 1, a ship that was under a false flag. and not only was the ship traveling without a license and were used drag nets, which are now banned.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also invaded into forbidden waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "taking measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time proof that such a special, collaborative way of working for the protection of the oceans actually works in the entire world sea.

<seg id="153">The road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are considered a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the inauguration of the President Nicolás Maduro.</seg>
<seg id="155">This image of María Alejandra Mora shows a close-up of the demonstration in Maracaibo in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="156">Released under the Creative Commons license.</seg>
<seg id="157">After the government of Venezuela rejected the opposition's motion to a referendum on a referendum, Venezuelans reacted in whose eyes the negotiations on the country's political and economic crisis ran into the void while gathered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (for example: the suppression of Venezuela), pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them can be found.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also being conducted in other parts of the country - including in the lowland area of Barinas, in the Andes Mountains Mérida and Táchira, in the central-north of the Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country deteriorates continuously, which makes itself felt in the daily life of Venezuelans by an acute lack of food and medicines.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw in the inauguration of the current President Nicolás Maduro the chance of a fundamental change; in the end, however, the reluctance to re-election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, contributor to Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">As part of the social, political and economic crisis, in which the inflation and the rate of inflation are among the highest in the world (inflation rate is estimated at 500% for the annual financial statements), and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine is the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance Mesa de la Unidad Diamrática or short MUD (about: round table of the Democratic Unity), in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together, called for a mass rally on the 27th of October, and a march to the Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan government headquarters, was planned to continue to block the referendum on office.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter, among other things, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">It is so far Venezuela: morning National Assembly, Friday national strike and on November 3rd all to Caracas to the Miraflores palace.</seg>

<seg id="171">The images of the marches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country, but also confrontations with policemen and supporters of the government.</seg>

<seg id="176">On Twitter, pictures that tell of disputes, as well as reports of repression and mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="177">Especially large waves struck the news about police repression in the centrally located town of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">There the protesters moved back to the local cathedral to protect themselves according to their own testimony to the police and armed proponents of the government.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they could safely leave the cathedral, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some demonstrators tried to stop police forces, including this woman in the Andean State of Táchira:</seg>
<seg id="181">The women in Táchira have no skirts, because otherwise one could see something that many nation-gardeners do not have!</seg>
<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic makes the round, which reflects the extent of repression per day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship has suppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the demand for a term of office, which has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="185">Myteks Media Labs added:</seg>
<seg id="186">Nicolás and Diosdado testify that 1% of the signatures are falsified.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here is your office!</seg>
<seg id="188">On the street!</seg>
<seg id="189">Others evaluate these protests as a further step in the fight against a government that has taken little against the disastrous economic crisis and would rather have dealt with critical voices:</seg>
<seg id="190">They took us so much - but also the fear!</seg>
<seg id="191">Marches are increasing in frequency and intensity.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview by Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 in Día a Día, an Argentinean news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to take a look at the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentine city of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano now said in the course of the great La Perla-Ribera process in the province of Córdoba, against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he retained his family secrets.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time I thought it was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years of age, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time, I could not see that my father was a thief, a torturer and a murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarmeriebeamter. during the Argentinian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 in La Perla prison.</seg>

<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos's son, a man who, over the years, recognized the extent of atrocities he had seen as a boy and who testified before a federal court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose for himself a path of redemption.</seg>

<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen objects were parked and kept me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>

<seg id="345">The photo was distributed in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="346">Review of the original photos by Joshua Levine.</seg>
<seg id="347">In the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can prolong his driving license, witnessed in the last month witnessed a particularly missuccessful translation.</seg>
<seg id="348">"" "on a sign, the Japanese word, the" "" "older motorists" "", "has been translated, wrongly - but perhaps also with malicious back thanking & # 8212; as" "" "terrible motorists" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read from September 1st to 20th on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Edited by Joshua Levine, which has been widely shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was the translator Julian Holmes, a citizen Kyotos. he was also the one who made the local newspapers aware of it.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun, which is published in Kyoto, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "" "" "how could it come to such an English translation?" ""</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"" "this is an insult to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable," "" "said Holmes." ""</seg>
<seg id="356">The flawed English translation was initially removed. the name "Hart drivers" (German: "terrible motorists") was later replaced by the more appropriate, albeit grammatically correct designation "elder drivers" (German: "older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The Kyoto prefecture apologized for the translation error. furthermore, it explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its correctness before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows about the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we are sorry that older people felt offended by insufficient correction (translation) on our part," "" "said the police." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News was a little more detailed with the phenomenon of "fearful" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"" "the word" "" "terrible" "" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents at the national level is quite a concern." ""</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture, for example, in 2005 1,941 of 19.460 accidents were caused by seniors. this corresponds to a share of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, senior citizens caused 1,803 of a total of 11,850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">Thus their share rose to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents has decreased overall, the share of accidents caused by seniors has risen in the same period.</seg>
<seg id="366">In the article published on Yahoo, the name not mentioned in the article published comments to the light which show what prejudices some Japanese ostensibly against older motorists:</seg>
<seg id="367">The article on Yahoo about translation errors has, among other things, the following comments:</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To translate, you need two important skills: passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and proactive language skills to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. in general, the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the source language - should be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ English as a native language, which could make translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost reasons or the relatively low number of English native speakers that learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that do not have foreign employees can still make translations in-house. then, the Japanese worker, whose English skills are evaluated as the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Automated translation is also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The confusing and puzzling sentences, produced by mechanical translations, show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time. this applies to some languages quite special.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the enigmatic imprints, which often adorn t-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable as jewelry or at least harmless. but from large corporations or by government who have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for their translation.</seg>

<seg id="391">Main page of the portal "Navegar con Libertad" (Free Surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, April 7, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they had no access to the online broadcaster Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later other users wrote that the internet presentations of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer available.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online broadcasters also recorded footage of the protests in Caracas organized by oppositional groups that oppose the government Nicolás Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began at the beginning of April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court themselves.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was appalled and recommended the users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Zensur: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet pages of Venezuelan providers are once again locked.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the page of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular with the Venezuelans with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been hesitant in reporting on protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission threatened them with fines and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw this as a "call to violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels I signed up at @ vivoplaynet again.</seg>
<seg id="403">Amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEinfiltrattro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay is inaccessible by blocking the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online channels. this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transmits its sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous investigations by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique by which the DNS servers answer certain requests of certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server replies faulty or refuse the request when calling such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third locked channel, the transmission was stopped on Thursday, April 6, when the VPITV camera man Elvis Flores, who carried the protests in Caracas live was captured.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went on stream again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it has also been reported that the government regulates Internet connections, making the Venezuelans access to multimedia coverage of the current events in the country more and more difficult.</seg>

<seg id="416">The following article is the shortened version of a structural report published by Global Voices with kind permission of the authors.</seg>
<seg id="417">The article is part of a series entitled "Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen," which is edited and republished by Global Voices in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "the one who has become something," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga has never been treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old, she began to work as Criadita for the family. in Paraguay, the more than 46.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money passes their underage son or her underage daughter to another, rich family. in exchange, the child receives food, training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">However, what is not mentioned here is that the children must pay for it countless days of housework that can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice called Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay due to participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She talked with Crimean tas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected witness testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call things in the name, because the feeling of gratitude that cries the Crimes assures in general silence.</seg>
<seg id="429">"Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family, which their daughter finds in the belief that they complete their training, improve their position in society and "make something out of themselves" can go to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family who assimilates the girl and justifies its exploitation by faith means giving someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and perhaps even starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The Sacrifice of Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is mistreated, his family will learn about it many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never experience it.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016, the hitherto relatively unknown phenomenon, which takes place in seclusion in the Paraguayan households, has a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín came to the hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed signs of violent blows. shortly afterwards she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military officer Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín was living with them in their home in Vaquería, a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometres east of the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016, Ferreira joined Marín as long as she suffered fatal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later, the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organisations such as UNICEF or Callescuela were deeply involved in the paraguayan society's practice of Criadazgo's death for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">"" "they described the Criadazgo as" "" "a modern form of slavery." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came to protest demonstrations and demanded that there should be "no further Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photos were widely spread in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"more cows are registered in Paraguay as children," Tina Alvarenga complained.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers it is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbors of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for rapid investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was their Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes to court, the case of Carolina Marín could be trend-setting - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Criadazgo comes to court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Crimean tas are not only exploited as workers, they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, where her father worked, had to register and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers had to work all the way and started selling sweets on the street or on the market in order to earn money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital Asunción as Criadita.</seg>

<seg id="461">She had to share her time in such a way that she still had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She got up every morning at five o'clock and prepared breakfast for her employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">Fridays, for example, cleansed the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was over, she went home again and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The sooner she finished learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But even this time was limited because they had to have dinner for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she never had to starve but also didn't get unlimited food. "I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge," she remembers.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well-equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathisant of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party that was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">At some evenings the owner Alvarenga forced to stand beside him and read editorials from opposition magazines such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">He tried to persuade them to not give faith to the reports of the official media about the dictator's regime.</seg>

<seg id="473">Her gentlemen feared that they would lose the education they had made possible again, explained them.</seg>
<seg id="474">But she was fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them, with her hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">"" "Alvarenga was also discriminated in the school." "" "a thing that is almost never spoken of is bullying and harassment exposed to Crimean when they go to school." ""</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anyone to come home. I didn't have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood.</seg>

<seg id="505">Within six months with the adoption of the law, users must register on the site of the site with their proper names and ID numbers in order to be able to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it failed to do so, this could involve a sentence of up to six months imprisonment or a fine fine.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill that consists of six paragraphs and curated in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent defines social media as "any application that is running and used over the Internet to communicate with others by voice, video alignment and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is not clear how the law will be enforced when it is accepted as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should impose the registration. it is unclear how they should make up those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies.</seg>

<seg id="515">In my opinion, they imagine that just as they are forcibly controlling physical public and private spaces, it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I take them seriously, it means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who request permission or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor people's activities and also to bring them to a court process.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not realistic - but everything is possible in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="518">"" "" "" "in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed in the Parliament's legislative and constitutional committees before it comes to the plenary debate." ""</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether its adoption and enforcement be successful or not, the draft is in line with a pro-military mindset in the parliament, in whose sense the control is maximized and that no deviating narration on the image surface is present, "says Raoof.</seg>

<seg id="526">A subtype of the larger family of leopards, which roams through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus alto saxicolor). they are endangered by Wilderei, the loss and fragmentation of their habitat and since they find less and less loot.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"" "as Raza shows in the video," "" "the Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" "" "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depend on a large predator." ""</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard in the wild is low and goes against zero. as the team in the video therefore states that they have a record of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in sheer joy.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School to Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by tsunami on 11 March 2011 and still the region is occupied with reconstruction.</seg>

<seg id="544">In the beginning of March 2017, the Kahoku Shimpo, responsible for northeastern Japan, documented the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple disaster" of March 2011. a huge earthquake, a tsunami and an nuclear accident in Fukushima had caused the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its seat in Sendai, which is located in the Prefecture of Miyagi. Miyagi Prefecture was a popular prefecture in Japan's Northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring counties of Fukushima and Iwate were forcibly evacuated, because the tsunami had caused entire coastal towns to disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">Even so, the prefecture of Fukushima had a nuclear accident, and that's why 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">From a local point of view, the Kahoku Shimpo report shows what progress six years later have been achieved to rebuild the lives of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">"" "" "" "the detailed report of the newspaper includes statistics from the Japanese rebuilding authority and survey results of those affected themselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing situation in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned substitutes will be completed in the Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was able to record the biggest success among the three prefectures, where 80 percent of the planned substitutes were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima forms the final light with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">Nevertheless, even six years after the catastrophe, evacuated by habitation shelters (from the mash, kasetsu Yutaku) are still trying to settle into final substitutions.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe almost 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 360,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate still lived in such dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the Evacuated from Fukushima in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuated families, who were haughing after the disaster in shelters, were resettled into final homes.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the number is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper could determine, 1074 of 1100 schools, which were affected by the misfortune, opened their doors by December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 percent of fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 per cent of the fishing ports have resumed their operations in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident, in the three prefectures of agrarian country, have been heavily affected.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 per cent of the agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland can be used again in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 acres of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farmland from Fukushima are located in the "nuclear zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but Fukushima remains well stricken here as well.</seg>
<seg id="567">The number of tourists in Miyagi and Iwate is up to 90 percent on the same level as before the misfortune. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only have 75 percent here.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the disaster nearly half of the coastal people find it more difficult to earn their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine an overall picture, the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and evacuated by the evacuated people. she asked her about the status of reconstruction and how her empathy has changed vis-à-vis the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction to the article the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents had taken measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of those surveyed find that still not enough in terms of disasters prevention has been done.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it is about those who had to be evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its edition to commemorate the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the Evacuees from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to witness not only the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also witness to the worst, catastrophic, nuclear disintegration that Japan had ever had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">From 160 000 Evacuees from Fukushima nearly 63 000 people were relocated to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 a little more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, have been relocated to permanent substitute homes.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the 2017 stand there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside of their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the catastrophic areas, most of the Evacuees, who still live in shelters, are older than 50 years old. they are well-known because efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima will have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people meet people from other countries that speak a different language, the differences seem to be larger than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often realises that one more than it seems at first glance.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important, as they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look closely at these global connections. in our Into the Deep Podcast we deal with issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember a moment in which they felt very strongly connected with someone about language and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Krikoni talks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Tori Egherman explains how the love for music has overwhelmed the lack of common language skills during a journey in rural China; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week: last Friday, a police officer took him up against his head during a demonstration in Goiânia. millions of demonstrators took part in a protest march against austerity measures.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, studied Social Sciences at the federal university of Goiás, suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated on this Saturday and have now moved him into an artificial coma.</seg>

<seg id="599">The local photo journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, which quickly spread in Brazil within a few days.</seg>

<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police announced in the Brazilian state of Goiás that Sampaio was suspended until the end of the investigation of the incident from the active ministry.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officer how he hits the face of the student Mateus Ferreira in Goiânia (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer was beaten by a demonstrator and landing on the intensive care unit, his face would be on TV for six months and the entire repression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desmissializador," a media channel by media activists from Goiânia, shared the video recorded by Luiz da Luz, in which one can see how Mateus is attacked by the police officer and rushing several paramters to him shortly afterwards.</seg>

<seg id="606">In the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mateus starting at the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the Mateus family, who lives in another state, Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian real reais (approximately 2,700 euros) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay at Goiânia while he is in hospital.</seg>

<seg id="626">With the launch of Álvaro Reynoso's law, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories all over Cuba joined the doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The popular community of Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - Spanish sugar mill - despite the fact that there are no appreciable sugar harvesting on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It was two years ago when the activities were paralyzed in the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After exhaustion, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until the smells of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commutes daily to the factories which still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran who rises every day at 4: 00 o'clock in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which after a long inactive time are back in operation because they were received.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene seems to have heard that Mañalich would receive the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, the low market prices, inefficiency, bad administration decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the amount produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are no news anymore.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railroad of the church already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction in the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated and hardly competitive, they became unbearable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Centauos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price increased over a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centauos per pound, published according to the 2016 report "Agricultural perspectives" by the OECD and FAO, the Agricultural and Food Organisation of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate around 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will certainly go into history," "" "these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavander." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years the decommissioning of a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people received their full salary for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the Gregorio Arlée Mañalich sugar cane factory on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez has worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">"" "when Nene, as he is known as a soldier, talks about the closure of the factory, the word he repeats the most is" "" "fraud." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents agree: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first year of closing, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">These were officially recorded documents, which would differ only with regard to the parts that would be removed, addressing and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was taken over and the letters were getting more and more frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the dismissal factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation," he asserted.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, is waiting for the retirement in another facility, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved against his will at the shutdown of the factory in which he helped.</seg>
<seg id="667">With each part he removed, he disassembled one of his 31 years of work.</seg>

<seg id="690">Recording a song from "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people of the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them. they do this using hip-hop, thanks to a series of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour, workshop leaders have provided mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the educator David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then with the Cree Hip Hop Group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop aims to ensure that young participants engage in discussions on topics such as "cultural identity, language, debate, love, self-acceptance" or whatever comes to mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the tribal area of the Kitumkalum First Nation in British Columbia tells, for example, the history of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a section in Western Canada, where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs is important despite the influences of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people did not always dominate the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song, that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the refrain is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got a little help from Gary Jolly from the Northstar Hip Hop Group, who gave them a drop in Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the facebook page of N'we Jinan the verse is available in transcript, as well a translation into English, which is translated into German here:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will take our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we have lost our way in life as a youth</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise someday</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and move forward as well as our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they have ordained to the Creator</seg>
<seg id="713">In the comment section, the reader and advocate of Cree language also contributes to Kevin Brousseau and adds the verse to syllabian (which is also published on his blog and is published here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">In order to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu, they are displayed near the entrance to shokuhin sanguu (and the "Plastics Models of the Courts") are issued by any food that is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the tokier district of Kappabashi, there are a variety of small businesses producing plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them any more. however, a new trend changes them today in striking cell phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matomas, the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new with plastic rubbers decorated mobile tapes as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods were turned into kitschy collection objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin fridge magnets for a new exhibition in Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food ageing is becoming more and more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, a catherless-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was turned into a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">This part is also part of the exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that's just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile stand and cell phone designers allow you to make your own work of art. in this case, ikura or salmon roe is used, a popular topping, served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there anybody who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now can I decorate my mobile with salmon cheating?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I'll be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appealing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile stand has the shape of melted ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (onigiri), earrings and palm-ribbons made of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">More skurrile plastic dishes can be seen at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag # to be the # fanatical.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, then this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, which is devoted to the supply of the restaurant industry.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the notorious "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the missing and polluted ones regularly only appear in statistics. however, these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">The report on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the head of the Sinaloa cartel, completely repressed the stories of the victims of the conflict in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the grieving or the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind each bone, behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret tombs, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">That is why the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "with the drug trafficking") that will give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were in the struggle between the law enforcement authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime not only causes us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much deeper.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as creeping as milk.</seg>

<seg id="777">KYHB, a writer of Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have known disease and sensationalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come across every day of newspaper clippings and see the front pages with pictures, which can actually only come from a textbook for criminology or from experts from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks that he wants to become Narco (German: drug traffickers) when he is big. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic deeds" of offenders when they walk through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it's as if they ridiculed those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the crime of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbouring village are justified by the fact that they were" "" "watered." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to convince themselves that they are spared from such tragedies if they are not stirring and silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the post "Four months blackmail in the capital district: how a family with threats has been plundered." in this she describes how an armed criminal month for month paid money from her business until she had destroyed not only the business but also torn her family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you've lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain of it never passes, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are away from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when to kidnap or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">In these terrible days, I wondered if wines were to dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article" "" "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: a Generation of Violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by the organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care about them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a orphan and he tells him that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, potatoes, tortillas warm and "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and he had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day that his childhood had ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood had already passed two years before, when he saw only a few blocks from his home, seeing the bloody dead body of his father, which had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, as violence caused by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of killings according to the Government of the Government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor's office included 3103 killings. this corresponds to 8,5 per day average.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal Político 2015 launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose goal is to illustrate the complex information behind the failed battle against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country in the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>

<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charred bodies that are lined up on the ground while persons watching it.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story doesn't come to its end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo was raised several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, and wrongly attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of the Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian towns of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastic atrocities in which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one left to count corpses," "" "said a Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many had been shattered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images the following time could be visually displayed.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unsolved, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of Boko Haram to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerged from the DR Congo, wrongly presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of abortions; Africa check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases, the picture was presented as a proof of mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further, personal comments such as this example falsely mistakenly attribute the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash message published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee were punches, rape and several dead, some caused by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported about the violence against Rohingya, Posts appeared like the following who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi-Arab news page, which was falsely claimed by President Myanmars Thein being, monks and politicians would have participated in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from the DR Congo to survey this information.</seg>

<seg id="917">USA, 2015.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the assassinations of Christians by Muslims, or - for the defense of Muslims - the assassinations of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth examining how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question is, however, what happens when readers can no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are tens of people who have inadvertently taken part in drinking water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">This mood of false and false information suggests that actual atrocities are untrue and embellish the real horror of what is actually happening in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The dissemination of violent images has already been debated extensively (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that refusing images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes, these pictures are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images desensitize readers and viewers and take the ability to empathize empathy (such as this study that investigates how violent media act to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss about violent portrayals in the news media, the fact is that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake News." they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be used detached from the context or in a completely abusive way.</seg>
<seg id="940">Any investigation of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog called untranslatable (e.g. irreplaceable) endeavours to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or at all not to translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">There are such words in every language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well-known today (like the famous Portuguese saudade) and others rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sobrmesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all stubbornly resist any attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression is not enough, which is why a complete explanation and sometimes a little context are necessary to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for a long time in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists handle Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird chose to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find for example words from the tax-lap language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"" "" "" "vakasteglok" "" "- Put yourself around your parents in recognition of how your younger years have tried." ""</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The comfort or laziness that you feel after being warmed up in the sun during cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They defrode other cultures, reveal other thoughts and awaken our curiosity.</seg>

<seg id="1135">Story telling, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the creation of stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the insurmountable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and honour the diversity of languages of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland in the United States, where TLS has been running events since 2015, there is a risk that small and not quite small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project applies:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where residents don't have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening often is connected to" "" "understand" "" "these events instead" "" "listening to appreciate, feel, touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers present their story first in their own language and then translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional story teller, their dedication and representation contribute to the fact that the audience takes care of it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions, as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso that is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou also seizes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art in her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamara tells the fables of the rabbit and the Baboon in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the meaning of his fables, John Nyamara is asked: "how is it to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" with a broad grin he shares his sense of inclusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">Until now, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and organizers hope to extend this. all those inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own storytelling.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of reviewing the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounted to 72 million US dollars, various religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration on April 3, 2017; the march started with the gratical capitol, the government building of the capital, and went to Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juan.</seg>

<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the French-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, managing director of Book Sprints, produces excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a Collective Night Research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, published last year and is available here license-free, contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it says:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to discuss how motions for free knowledge are built up and what the real costs are with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create a sense of our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was removed from the directory of the Adra Prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about his current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice, who want to push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, instantly.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have let us start thinking about their own destiny, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we decide for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of temporary extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody for Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred to an unknown place from the Adra prison, a non-military establishment.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "military police bass was taken on the basis of a" strictly secret "command of the military court from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that on 12 November 2015, they were contacted by persons who presented themselves as the insider of the Assad government and notified them of an alleged death sentence against their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">But its place of stay and condition remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of creative commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basel's cultural prototypes was more prospectable than the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archeological sites in the world, was the intersection of numerous civilizations and here combines Greek-Roman architectural styles with local traditions and Persian influence.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time Bassel was not able to know that ten years after he began work, the IS would make everything possible to extinguish this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Syria, but of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedition into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Strangely, Bassel has not been able to complete this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life with it, dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English, even when he was in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked. he taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of waiting (waiting), a prostitute that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together in the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English.</seg>

<seg id="1249">Those arrested or disappeared under the regime were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">According to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International, at least 17.723 Syrians have died in detention until 2016.</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mozambique: back to previous post due to corruption-judging Director after release</seg>
<seg id="1255">With anger, Mozambique reacted to a corruption incident where a government member returned after half of his prison sentence to the state apparatus in which corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 together with four other defendants for an embezzlement of 54 million Metikal (about 800 000 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public money from the airports of Mozambique, whose advice was Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 due to good leadership and immediately called for his resetting to the company, which happened on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General's Office of the Republic who submitted the application, there would be no obstacle to Cambaza to return to his old post because the company did not undergo disciplinary proceedings after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many people don't know the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">In an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integrida de Pública, short CIP), condemned the decision of the company to resign the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and exemplifies the lack of transparency and is even a step backward with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that even the company should have initiated a disciplinary action against the offenders.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company apparently held no reasonable legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"" "Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mozambicanian social media, also rejects this behaviour and considers the case as" "" "disgusting" "" ":" ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent type, he would be a consultant, after being sentenced to a prison sentence and half of whom had served.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could keep paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has consented to be reintegrated into the company he helped to harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Consequently, it is obvious: Cambaza is happy to be paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Contradictory!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil, says the director has no moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the State because he was insulting him, I can't believe someone in such a way rewarded the state so massively.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks morality and to serve the state * he had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but only served himself by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as it was an inexhaustible fund of money and the state itself became tired of this man who was pre-loaded and sentenced to a long prison term.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts out of the net, because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although it is still discussed about the origin of the word, it is usually used to refer to people of Eastern indian origin or generally be used as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook is censoring the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or the" "" "masked" "" "(in Burmese writing) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciating connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that even posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubt for their use have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with fundamentally different meanings that have the same character sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair on Burscaris also written 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae', 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kaleiaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooking Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because it contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he had asked his friends in a witty way if they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The sentence ku la - "Healing" + the question word (la) on Burmesan - resembles the racist expression much, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet believes that she will reduce hate speech by radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook needs to be more analytical before it destroys all the posts that are suspected of spreading racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "Facebook does not delete the word" "" "Kalar" "" "manually." ""</seg>
<seg id="1306">It automatically filters the word.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism will not understand what you write on Facbeook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the remaining words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">"" "for example," "" "Kalar Htine" "" "and" "" "Kalar pae" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists, who spread hate speech, receive a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to everyone who disseminates hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy will not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks simply begin to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to clear his posts when he wanted to let his friends know that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new policy of Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is closed.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from posting, posting and sharing content for 24 hours, because the post "posted the Facebook Community Standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speeches of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech removed from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author expressed his opinion on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism are bad in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community asking for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma by its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "peas curry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsified Posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a great deal of sales, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook's automatic censorship has provided a lot of spam among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and deliberately write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken off the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that didn't contain any hate speech but were nonetheless removed:</seg>

<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children already married to 15 in Trinidad and Tobago was 2.8 percent, and with 18 it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the country's statistical office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1,300 boys were married under 19 of 1997-2007.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements endeavored to abolish laws for children's marriage followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring about this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, not everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "a Hindu leader, for example, had no qualms to say to the critics of the childrens" "", "they were supposed to take care of their own affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition provided tension in this actually uncomplicated case, and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the draft law at all.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the bill against the childrens "marriage was decided - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent who abstained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country must agree and let the law be proclaimed.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators gave a status update on Facebook, which Leslie-Ann Boiselle posted on Instagram again:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the childrens was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and not one single against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">Having previously decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were enthusiastic because the laws had finally been changed for the children's marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who is a Minister of Education in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It took too much time and unnecessary talk, which disguised the core of the matter, but do you know what? the children's marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that is worth almost every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson was the opinion, it was definitely long enough to abolish the practice, Lara Quentral-Thomas was overjoyed that the day was finally arrived:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public status update on Facebook by Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which says:, Excellent news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The marriage network has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, voices - 35 for it - 0 on the other hand!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Fade Mutota, which belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group, which openly spoke openly about how important the adoption of the law was, noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The age of marriage in Trinidad and Tobago is now 18 years, independent of religious affiliation.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft for the amendment of the marriage network was decided today, on 9 June 2017.</seg>

<seg id="1373">Congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="1374">A thank you to our MEPs.</seg>
<seg id="1375">However, a potential hook occurs in the form of Sat-Maharaj, the Secretary General of Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the well-known Hindu organization of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago, Maharaj has announced his intention to take legal steps, the law should be adopted, and he seems to redeem his promise now.</seg>
<seg id="1377">During the General Attorney General, Paris Al-rawi, a proponent of the law, said it was quite legitimate if Maharaj wanted to act against the law, most social media users desired the debate on the subject differently.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">"" "" "" "dear Sat, if we, instead of discussing the discussion so broadly, in a way that we, to invite the state into our bedrooms," "" "simply purposefully say that the state, our daughters, protects them from being abused by large, hard-boiled men that are opposed to them," "" "would you be ready to continue the discussion?"

<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But whether it comes to a legal action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where children are legal or still the norm in various levels, although there are laws which they underline.</seg>

<seg id="1390">By mirroring websites, Turkish users can again watch Wikipedia content</seg>
<seg id="1391">The English-language Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright law in the United States, internationally obscured.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month now Turkey has been blocking the popular and crowdsourcing principle of Encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day becomes more clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blockage.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech-savvy Internet users are used to use bypass tools for blocked websites (a recent article by the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence of the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia since 2008, as described recently in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China Turkey is the second most known country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked there are now several mirrors (pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), as the platform laid down all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (computer calculator connections), which does not rely on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is available despite legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After listening to the messages (via the blockage of Wikipedia), we used everything to place snapshots from Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. so there is the possibility to read the contents on decentralized and distributed way.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org itself.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS has also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it only deals with screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a mirrors page from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that anyone can use to host similar mirrors, if in the respective country Wikipedia is banned.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member as well as staff at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access a different URL that is not the original. that what you see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server sends the request to the right Wikipedia page, so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">This is done by a server which is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with poorly positioned motifs and well-washed colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then he was a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar strives to bring Nepal's wildlife to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown, right next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention on Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this prime situation helps in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wild animal photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when I suddenly called me to Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Lake). he had received a call from my father that would be a leopard on the banks of the Rapti River.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The dam is only a few minutes from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard found itself and I immediately started to bend pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to cooperate with the authorities to gain global recognition for Nepal's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know [it]; for he was already face to face to Tigers:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be bothered by the mind of the sheep during sleep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the buzzing appeared. he immediately sat down, we look at him and he stares me through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">"" "to promote the protection of wild animals Sagar places the logo" "" "I click for conservation" "" "(lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos." ""</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for promoting Nepal's nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and usually lived in a tent to make recordings of Otters at the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds who live near the tourist arrivals.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This article was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and originally appeared on video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organisation from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was once again published as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India women have the greatest care to pronounce the name of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "instead they use a pronoomen or say" "" "father of my child" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh women admit that due to social pressure they should respect the husband, as well as fear of the consequences they should use the norm to keep this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted by the Indian State of Odisha and rejected by her family and the village community after addressing a married relative with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of naming their wives also not by name is widespread also among men. however, they have far less assurance to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the Pune district, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel and housewives, joined a unique club and became the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs there are in 13 Indian states, he is part of the # KhelBadal campaign, which is operated by the Video Volunteer community and advocates for the removal of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paist has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera at the discovery of practices, such as children's marriage to the exile of HIV and AIDS infected, and leads this club.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She tells us how these clubs create a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her panel discussion was of women who did not call their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this subject because she wanted to open up the discussion about the patriarchy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to pronounce the name of their husbands as loudly, is a custom that they all maintain and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and desires a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is considered a deceitful woman, a woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about it until this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">Rohini, who had never called her husband at the beginning, wanted to try out at home, how it works.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband kept silence for a long time after the video ended.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him by now on his name." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started her first discussion with this self-confidence in the luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked all, "If we can't say the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, does that mean they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equal?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day on which they brought the name of their husbands over their lips," says Rohini Paist from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about breaking a centuries-old tradition in which married women can never pronounce the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she was only taking care of herself during the whole exercise, and another decided to release the whole grained frustration with him and his family by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the rush of adrenalin to have broken with an age-old custom, the women decided that they would actually attempt at home to call their husbands on behalf.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini received a large number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put the woman in her head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini said I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation escalated in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinnocent red dot on the forehead, which indicates the Ehestatus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only need to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would wear the zinnoberred dot if he did it too.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed, and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not stopped completely with it, but think they are now in a better position to choose to not wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make a trip to each discussion club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Usually we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to worry about who could hear," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their life; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never really talked about some things, such as our identities to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say certain things loud, no matter how small they happen to you.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have been wearing saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most, that's okay, but some wanted to wear a sage-kurta, a wide shirt over a pants, they haven't dared.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own choice of clothes, morality linked to the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled her own couple of Kurtas (Oberhemden) into a discussion, so that the women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will do it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Rohini confirms that things are slowly rolling in the five months since the first lub of the discussion:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have only made small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then stopped to tell the name of their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, make it, but only if they are alone and there are no other members of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberrot on their foreheads at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the haggling for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini declares:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1554">Many well-known Japanese sizes had reached their zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The cult band's music is "more than just a universal language," said Ryuichi Isaka, president of the retail giant Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review.</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping of rough-headed persons for organ trafficking, probably for believing ends, worries the police of Zambézia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month, three men were killed in the district of Mille, a few kilometers from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was found decapitated and some of the organs were taken.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently confessed that the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi are used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There is the local superstition that the head of a glimmer man can unlock gold or bring wealth, the police spokesman of Zambézia said to the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive assaults on glib-headed men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of submissions for obskure purposes, is people with Albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the UN to carry out a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with Albinism is common in other countries of Southern Africa, especially in neighbouring Tanzania where the government developed campaigns to combat these superstitions and prejudices.</seg>

<seg id="1595">He warned those who are going to travel to the country:</seg>

<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Milange where the killings took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Hushed Algy Adamo, student and inhabitant of the city of Inhambe in the south of Mozambique, said that the local police have already followed the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of the bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of slipping-headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morrumbala, province of Zambézia, has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans, which also indicates that a belief exists, according to which the victims had power in the head power generating wealth.</seg>

<seg id="1602">Angela Ferreira Samantha shared on Facebook the chronicle of Bloggers poor Snaippa, who indicated that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique:</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, probably just recently made.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo has drawn attention in the international community after his attorney announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized for liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto calling for democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the State Department in China has referred Lius case as" "" "an internal affair" "", "and a narrator says he" "" "is not deemed necessary to discuss this matter with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless China continues to appeal calls from the international community, Nobel Peace Laureate and his wife, poet Liu Xia, to release or allow him treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely wiped out of the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a speaker refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow a treatment abroad for Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway - Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and foreign minister Børge Brende have refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway was stalled after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government hastened that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed until December of last year. only in June, Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon exports to China, as exports have been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his prize.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union - European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately release Liu and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called for China to release Lius, as stated in a statement on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Lius's wife and family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They should meet and receive all the visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>
<seg id="1651">United States of America</seg>
<seg id="1652">"" "U.S. Ambassador Terry Branstad told that the Americans" "" "wish him that he has the opportunity to treat him abroad insofar as he can help him in his recovery." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman of the US embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced on 27 June that the message agency AFP asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu, but also to free his wife Liu Xia from house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The demand for the US embassy attracted a furious response from China, with the utterance of the State Department that "no country has the right to interfere and make irresponsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley shared with the fact that China should offer the following to the couple:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom, such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice, to which it claims according to Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1659">Germany and Germany</seg>
<seg id="1660">German government spokesman Steffen Seibert wrote on July 3, Berlin hopes that "Liu" gets all the medical support he needs and that a "humanitarian solution for Liu Xiaobo should be the highest priority."</seg>
<seg id="1661">Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on the G20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing reported to the news agency Reuters that China had great qualms about whether the vortex around Liu could overshadow the visit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada and Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum asked China to provide Liu with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu Attorney told AFP before that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that it is not allowed Liu to talk and contact someone outside, including his lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues to tell:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada calls on China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and to release the rights reserved to the exercise of these rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France and France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's Foreign Ministry requested China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons in a declaration on 29 June:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he needs, regardless of where, needs. furthermore, his wife and his family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news station France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the State Department announced that there will be no further information whether France will ultimately record it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan and Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of continental seats in Taiwan called on China on 27 June to release Liu and show a greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislator Yu Mei-nu from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, expressed himself very much in a statement on 28 June around Liu and admitted that many have asked him to pray for Lius well being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives which he took and for whom he had been strictly punished would have led to a more harmonious, more stable and affluent China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, signed Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 domain Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem foolish since Singapore is recognised as an independent state at an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam, Singapore was to be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of meeting the international branch of the New York Bar Association, the Minister noted that many people criticised Singapore's only political party because they compared Singapore to other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported Singapore to be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has asked whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The Cavalierio blog accused the Minister of Justice to "twist the logic" to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and efforts to create this precious land, we can say that we are not a country in the end.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you're not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons given by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of it, he inevitably appeared undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he has defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities which are permanently run by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the core of the subject, the good old lyre emerges from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leave the distorted logic, as it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, the last week of Shanmugam gave answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judicial system, our political system really non-responses.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He disguised the corresponding questions with non-answers rationally.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls on Shanmugam to clarify his opinion, since she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">When Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clarify this point as long as he was paid up to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his comment on the blog, Anon points out that he should start reading the entire transcript of the conference so that one can better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said Singapore is rather a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "he explained why the Singapore elections are so uneven important even if we enjoy free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the US (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said Singapore" "" "be no country," "" "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, the leader of a growing generation that makes such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice said of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard that expected me - if I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of political leaders in Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it, and is aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review decomposes the weaknesses of Shanmugam's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "did Mr. Shanmugam committed a" "" "good faith" "" "or was it a Freudian interpreter?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only seen as an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, what country will the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">As he plays an important role within the government cabinet, Mr. Shanmugam's statements are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapore do their military service, do they defend their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay our Prime Minister bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our Pink Personnel Training?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>

<seg id="1729">"" "" "" "I didn't say what I said..." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have annoyed many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"" "I can understand that we often hear statements like" "" "the defense of the country above all" "", "but that is not quite correct." ""</seg>

<seg id="1745">On my clarification most of the time the standard response follows: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many Canadians perhaps cook internally against anger when they are held for Americans, but I don't bother me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know, there is little that Canadians differentiate us from Americans.</seg>

<seg id="1796">One of the problems the Junta continues to pursue is to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black vans before putting them into an internment store, another problem.</seg>

<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period more than 10.000 people lived here, today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost cities.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic for Tkuarchal.</seg>

<seg id="1815">In 1989 about 43.000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about $2.50 the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - but there are hundreds of African and Haitian migrants here.</seg>

<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city, a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have taken migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He started to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night.</seg>

<seg id="1946">After he lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula come from Central America, others also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children, who wanted to squeeze money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and a stranger, a single educator, offered him her roof.</seg>

<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check point for personal communication devices in Xinjang from Twitter users will be out of the line.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The residents of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority in western China, are forced to install spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, mobile users in the Tianshan district of the town of Urumqi were given a mobile notification in which it instructs the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the announcement, the app is said to" "" "prevent access to terrorist information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities also used the app to use the app for more than fighting terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because they, shortly after having installed the app, had exchanged messages with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the communication of the police, the app was able to detect and track the sources and distribution channels of terrorists along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, pictures, books and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwang's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main feature is blocking pornographic websites, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the filters for minors is intended to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While reporting about digital censorship in China is mostly focused on the experience of users in major cities in the east and south, reality is very often dark for those who live in remote, crowded areas of ethnic minorities such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The media outlet based on Twitter, "Images from mainland China," published censored news in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where policemen checked the residents indiscriminately to see if they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use devices intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of imprisonment by the rest of the rest.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" (out of the scale of the world) also published a jingwang product description, from which the software can raise the password request of a Windows operating system and thus receives unrestricted access to the hard drive of the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang, computers and mobile phones will become electronic handcuffs in Xinjiang.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The Regulations in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, government agencies and affiliated institutions including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office when operating their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report by Freedom House, a U.S. human rights organisation, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities published a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards" by the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos." however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a whole series of other possible offences, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and opposition</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors; sometimes he locks to his canvas, sometimes to his computer, sometimes to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what one can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips spotted with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives on the top floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaibs family to flee out of their village in Palestine in which they lived as felahyees (about: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years now, Hdaib has been a passionate activist opposed to the conservative majority and questioned her old-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapeseed.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his mind, and he can sympathise with the people who suffer from the disastrous consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not openly admit it, he harms a special reluctance against US foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, have anything to do with his identity as "Palestinian refugees of the second generation," he denotes himself, even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine before.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think so because of my own living circumstances," "" "says Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so because I am a human being" "" "while he poured in water soldered Nescafé in two cups. it's the holy month Ramadan, in that time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a sensing hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the mucks speak lukewarm coffee and the rakes of the Kent-cigarette in the nose primarily of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air, especially when one throws a glance into neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan - drink water - in order not to land in jail.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the interior ministry of Jordan has announced a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian Branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front-singer Hamed Sinno contradicts the country's cultural and traditional norms and the main reason for the concert evening.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"" "the deputies and former press secretary of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert" "" "just" "" "had been cancelled because of the singer's sexual orientation." ""</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the band's commitment in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which puts the old-proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila appreciated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," who continue to advocate for an intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement probably should not be shallow rhetoric, but in fact reflect an increasingly clear crystallizing reality in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib retired traditional gender norms by educating his vision of the fate of Arab women having premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an apparently trampled unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In recent years, the number of 'Honorary Morde' has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of Honorary Morde reached its zenith in 2016; however, it is even more difficult that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a crime law on crime in 1954, women who are exposed to the risk of domestic violence can "remain in prison indefinitely," and for their release there is often a long-term bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee on the part of the family that nothing will happen to the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaib's music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from issues that have long been taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">I was informed about politics, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib tackles the question of Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb," the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political at the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song entitled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse repeatedly repeats itself:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market in which, in his words, "that can get what you want" - be it faith or non-belief, heterogeneity or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noted that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gays and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals were still censored up until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014 Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya in order to later notice that his comments were torn out of context, distorted and his opinion had been censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts, but was only a edited version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib acquires openly for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance towards homosexuals does not correspond to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, which still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuwhat, who should work later on behalf of the caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou 'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the Hashemite kingdom there is nothing new anymore that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian intelligence service established several former government officials and members of the teacher association, arguing that they were critical of the problems linked to the corruption-rooted corruption in commentaries on social media.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaibs's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">Jordan has prevented Mashrou 'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - this is Hdaib - consists of slow, thought and inner changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without any intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of "experiencing it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will be approached with a genuine and fundamental openness by means of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, cluster munitions, and artificial democracies. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until the time has come, Hdaib will continue to rap and consequently resist.</seg>

<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warrior dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One supposes that it is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the armoons, drums, and dancing come from a time when armies of West Japan marched into the north-east to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, to its knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to snap some great seats, so we have a super view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can hardly imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking for the Meguro Gajoen for a long time now: two feeders are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the journey to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and yet another breathtaking way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebuchaFestival.</seg>

<seg id="2167">Outer appearances and body care were rarely so important as in this story, because they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate profession as those of the hairdresser.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, close to the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate, where street robbery and illegal drug trafficking are everyday.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - experienced an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to more and more regular citizens to go into the experienced hands of hairdressers that can recreate these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the dressings of the hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been held since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There experts compete against each other to show who of them can create the most eccentric look, as you can see in the following video (more videos about current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to persuade young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to get an education in the hairdressing art instead of poor advice that allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the possibilities that offer, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops before the school year which began in March and reported some of its successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only school in the community and the district, which we are very proud of, because of love for the children we have built up this educational community.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love Letters to guerilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the article entitled" "" "lovers of guerilla fighters" "", "published by the international online magazine" "" "Tea After Twelve" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Isn't it even more important to accommodate people who feel ventured to counteract affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This was exactly the question of the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga of the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Cartas por la arliación (Letters to Reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part to it: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government signed a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary Defense Forces of Colombia), which forms the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">Internationally, the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services.</seg>
<seg id="2188">Before the Columbians, however, there is still a long way until one can speak of real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters who have lived in illegal detention for many years, exposed to a war rhetoric and carrying out their weapons around the clock, must now re-integrate into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, which had accustomed itself to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now take it into its ranks and support it in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians had to join together and help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back into society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The goal of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla fighters who are to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share his love with people this year, who needed the most urgent response.</seg>
<seg id="2198">So the plan was to write letters of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now have to find their place in society and build a new life. "the letters will show that Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Up to now, more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on March 19th.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students of the University Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation Bogota traveled to the camp to personally transfer the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC set up as they had done earlier in order to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no commands, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it's unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything between them," said the political student Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down because next to him on the bed was a MGL-Granatlauncher, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty Battle.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I said," "" "Hello, what are they doing right now?" "" "he said," "" "I am answering a letter that someone has written to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very beautiful and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life has someone written something so beautiful, that's why I answer it. "suddenly tears ran to me about the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and sat down beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was also tired of the war, was sorry to be all the years of faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life as a war. to join the FARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers before starvation. "I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside there waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">So far I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace prevails, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New Voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">To begin with, students and some leaders of the FARC agreed to a discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">For this reason, the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organisation, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the State impacted upon the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can help shape society in this country just more equitable.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "the goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles," "" "one of them said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Those people who have never heard hearing and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I often seen as monsters and even hated even people with beautiful feelings that have been turned around by their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, hurts me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the city of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian was prophesied that after the disarmament peace would rule.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people willing to take up arms, rise up and protest for their rights. and that is also fully justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC are now putting on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">Therefore, we call upon all the defenders of peace - no matter which race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will endure many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "then I heard a sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" "" "how long will you still honor the family, you Shandstain?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital at the end of the day.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently, some women had brought everything together and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had two catches in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which ambulances were you placed - in which of the men or the women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out as a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for being respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month at the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They asked me to send me back to Chechnya to prove that all was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They set absurd demands: some said to me that I must prove it by running above without through the streets; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Grozny and say that I had not changed my gender, that all was only bad talk, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have Körmend size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "You have brought a monster to the world, which has corrupted not only your family, but the whole Republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">We can't touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">"" "" "" "my mother was too much, and she lay down a rope around his neck." ""</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with darkened windows and a number plate with a 95 mm plate under the window.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that something was lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you work?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to reveal their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help I left the country, but then something unexpected happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought them without registering, without ID, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I received a message: "you don't believe, you're sure, just because you have left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you plug. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it to you: it is number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we do not talk about gender equality, that is a taboo subject.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional Caucasian items still carry me in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I really don't give any trouble to look at the person they remember from their past - in other words, my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends, those who have been dortaged?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: last week I submitted a report to Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For him I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who had been in the gun for a half and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that no people were arrested and tortured during Ramadan, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not shut up a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">In doing so, I mean, they probably invite relatives, these take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end they require evidence that the so-called "honor" has experienced through blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are there still gay men arrested in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there would not be so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to face Kadyrov's judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there, so that they can later be presented as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say:" "" "if they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim that they have attacked any village or a military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, but deliberately submerged in order to radicalise.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this only a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was himself when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, but there were no reports yet. we suspect that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know whether these persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation already took place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known all over Grozny, when I still lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In serious!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was considered, I had never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">Russia was originally intended to bring us to the "Civilization," but in the end it has thrown us back into the Stone Age.</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had dyed eyelashes, wore tubular jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security ministry of Sharia has never curbed me even a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian Theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me met.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks stood, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"" "in the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is," "" "Lie not over the misfortune of another." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to be children, when people make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were ill?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never offended me, never hunted and never struck.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this time of grace stop?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrov stepped on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began talking about morality on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not speak about us per se, but primarily about the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless, one could feel how people began to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had smiled and laughed beforehand looked at you at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the meantime I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home I could feel how the situation in the Republic deteriorated steadily.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: which activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teetrews, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have a cents for it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I picked up some species of breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hiddenab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature is, it has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens who want to prophesy with foam in front of the mouth that there are no gays with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The rodents have which the Cabardins have, the Russians have also which; on the whole planet they exist, but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it is unpleasant for me to hear such things.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus here.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think of transience to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be exact, different life settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me, it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry I'm so personally here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all, I simply know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last months there is a strong increase in suicide.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27 drew the desperate situation of the Arab ancestor community in Iran, which is marked by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness to be able to rise to his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who work in Ahwaz and want to remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had kindled himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors could not do anything any more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide which happened in August in the Arab ancestor minority, and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take their lives.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - have been imposed.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers who felt helpless and incapable of nourishing their families and doing a safe work because of the persecution from the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2410">"" "Arab" "" "Ahwazi" "" "suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination" ""</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region in which most of the Arab ancestor community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to deny their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab ancestor was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy took over power and in 1925 took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable agricultural areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population receives only little from this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victim of untreated diseases, hunger and privation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime has been systematically refusing the Ahwazi Arabs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a variety of dams that divert water from the Arab territories into the Persian areas, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to worsening the devastation caused by dryness in the region, and destroying local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industries.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawk youngsters has increased to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general director of cooperatives, work and social welfare, stated that 5% of Ahwazis who are looking for a job, completed the primary school, 55% completed a secondary school and 45% have university degrees.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"" "a" "" "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian human rights activist living in London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" of the number of suicide among young Ahwazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">For this reason, a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since functionaries and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers, the local Arab ancestor is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livelihood outside their home country of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first name and surname to hide their affiliation to the Ahwazi and thus be hired, since even Arab names are not tolerated at the workplace, let alone the speech of the Arabic language or the wearing of Arabic clothes.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In view of the given circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi has to endure, human rights activist alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking notice of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought-out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all feminine * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, despite the same education, women still earn less money than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms always make sure that women sooner or later encounter a glass ceiling in various areas of life and that discrimination based on sex is still spreading across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I am suffering double and triple.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: if I come to talk on skin colour, on racism, on black women women, black women in the LGBTIQ community or black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have always been misused in racial segregation and discrimination, both in and out of feminist movement, many white feminists decide to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">However, they all agree that women - all women - should come together to "lift up their voices and to sing" Kumbaya, my Lord "to achieve equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about that in addition to sexualised violence, there is an institutionalised form of racist-motivated violence, that we are exposed to black women in two ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnic groups and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with migratory backgrounds are often referred to school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"" "" "" "or that women in black spheres and women with migrant backgrounds are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of any skin colour to have the same rights; on the other hand, as a black woman, I cannot join a movement in which the white woman stands, who refuses to take into account inequities in her mind, referring to the gender as well as the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "in 1851, Sojourner complained in her speech:" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman in a historical sense is a demented and marginalized being." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropriation in order to drive their egocentric program forward.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlapping skin color and gender. for some of them continue to silence the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to teach them a better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different origins a home and differentiate themselves from the white feminism, there is still the word "feminism" in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to release myself completely from feminism and join the movement of Womanism, which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of using myself for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson Weems, the author of the book Africana possibly: claims (for example: Africa-Womanism: as we reclaim ourselves) speaks of the fact that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces where they can be completely safe and in which the cultural, mental, emotional, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped that make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself of the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement that the black woman is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment, I can lift black women and women from other cultures, for in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment in which my life neither passed, nor ignored, nor refused.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abbreviated and edited version of the article "The Wave of Violence Against Women in Paraguay" by Kurtural. the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# female) reported on the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected people.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police inspector told Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-member, who had become violent against her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman showed Balbuena due to maltreatment, Ada Báez's accurate display of Ada Báez did nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later the second woman resumed her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">Women generally do not receive support from the State.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence should contact the law enforcement authorities at all.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Content 1 punches and statistics 2 unseen abuse and a legal system that does not compromise 3 Paraguay's laws: good approach, lack of implementation impacts and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is hard to determine how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y EStudios, a socio-scientific research institute in Paraguay. "there are various information and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the numbers available are alarming.</seg>

<seg id="2495">In the ads 40% of women said they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>

<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos. but for two years she inherited the psychological violence on his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult one:</seg>

<seg id="2509">When I read about it, I always thought that only women who are too subservient because they let themselves be fooled by violent men.</seg>

<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse caused by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming names, she wrote articles on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she liked the so long of Carlos and didn't leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least would have a certain complicity.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture takes place with his consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or even mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on site: on the one hand, many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent are missing.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious implications in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment in the investigation of these diseases by the pharma companies is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research carried out by African scientists is helping to build their own research capacities in Africa. a greater role in science and technology can only be conducive to economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Central Laboratory at the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in Lusaka, Zambia, in the 1990s, just as the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched the HIV virus before deciding to go back home to support the Serbian health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about the misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment, the focus of my work is on the application of research results. in doing so, I support the Serbian national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I just started a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what do you think of the important current science topics in your country and in Africa in general?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always remain a receiver instead of being a maker yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are promoted differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here because funding and development chances are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What are the obstacles in your routine research work you don't have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money, a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is already an interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">How large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on, and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special scientific training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, exploration of space, health care (non-communicable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of living as a scientist in Africa vis-à-vis western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often it's the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that challenges challenges.</seg>
<seg id="2626">"" "the system that magazines can only make articles accessible against payment (the so-called" "" "Payback" "" ") limits the amount of information available and the speed of research." ""</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website of Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been cultivating salad in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">His company offers 114 sorts, such as Outlangeous, the first plant that has been grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by its own ingenuity and the question of how many salad kinds he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents applied not only for individual types, but also for certain properties, such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or chained leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as crop or carrot varieties. based on this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia of old tradition, Morton always greets lettuce, but he needs longer since his work becomes more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it's as if in a river a boulder is lying to which I have to paddle." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we must do that now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think that these patents go too far on salads." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand in court, nobody can breed a new kind of salad, because all the features are already patented. "so he goes on as well as possible and tries to breed those features that he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very careful and strives to not use any material protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the US and anywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red roasts of the Outshutter variety in the "glasshouse" of the station. there, it is tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is not by chance that this name sounds rather as if the movement comes from the IT sphere and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "open source" seeds) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was created to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus are permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can undertake to freely use the seed they have bred.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and they can sell it. "open source" breeders only allow others to breed their seeds to breed their own varieties, and not immediately sow - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-Management Board, Jack Kloppenburg, control of seed and the ability to breed new plants is important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">According to seed, seed plays a role in greater coherence, such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasizes that the "open-source" movement does not deal with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seed," he says, and takes on the increasingly common mergers in the global agricultural industry, whose recent examples are the mergers of ChemChina and Syngenta and Monsanto and Bayer. "those who want to buy good, locally and sustainably produced vegetables should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed initiative are committed to making their seed available free of charge. thus, their approach is contrary to patent seed and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered as the available gene pool, due to the ever increasing intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always available, shrinks continuously.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has engaged in her PhD work with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all the carrot characteristics are protected as intellectual property, making it impossible for plant breeders to use either at all or only complicatedly.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, there are no such estimates, but experts such as Luby suspect that large-scale crops such as wheat are patented in even bigger style than lettuce or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of perspective</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are bred in such a way that they have specific desirable characteristics - from those through which their taste or colour improves to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and can withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing through more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the altered conditions are much worse predictible by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto acknowledges Carly Scaduto that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Agricultural Ministry of the United States, the company is committed to maintaining genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "it contradicts, however, that intellectual property has other breeders' closets, since" "" "patents and protection of plant varieties promote innovation." "" "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to get the same result using another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection does not inhibit innovations, but rather encourages them to provide more material and know-how to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks different: 20 years to wait until a patent expires, he certainly does not promote innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to breed plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you have already lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">However, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain: "independent plant breeders do not have the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to facilitate their work to farmers.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what motivates us, and it is impossible for us to continue using the best and most recent genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">"" "in total Morton interferes with the concept of patenting plant characteristics:" "" "we don't really create the features ourselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form themselves and as a breeder we have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeders in the US state of Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "he who breeds a variety breeds his own values in her.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation it needs to be used masses of herds, breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is just contrary." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto) have patents, they create most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"" "Morton also believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents:" "" "it looks like I'm working with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2682">I constantly need new material for my catalogue, because I know that my rivals will sell my varieties for a few years, "he says." with a patent you are protected against competition for 20 years, making it very easy for my opinion. "worldwide resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the US seems to be a leader in the "open source" breeding, the concept is now spreading rapidly around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture, which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, implements a "open source" seed programme. to preserve the seeds of traditional crops, the Centre works with farmers and helps them breed new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest censorship goals in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities are still blocking content on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 05.August, the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANGEI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports about the above.</seg>
<seg id="2724">"" "" "" "in August, the network published a statement on Facebook in which it sharply criticized the Egyptian authorities and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region." ""</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic network for Human Rights information remains true despite this attack and the ridiculation of the Egyptian right and the constitution by the authorities who should defend the law, to expose the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world. even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals, it has never been as important as it is now.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANGEI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arab-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network from Qatar for alleged "support for terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human Rights Organizations of the wave of the web side lockouts fallen victim. @ anhri one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANICAI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the distribution of columns and articles that he writes for websites and media not accessible to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he set up to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government, became the target of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider in which also Ziadas blog is given a home, on the other hand, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video about how the police exercised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles mainly revolve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada voiced himself to the blocking by the government and reflected what this meant for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">To lock blogs is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and although the block of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It is possible for them to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege; an arrest, an attempted murder, summons to the National Security Council, the blocking of blogs as well as any other website for which I was working.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) They have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words: my words have influence, albeit only to a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used to post items to circumvent the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now that they have locked him and that they're afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave move the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August. this resulted in technical tests on networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Afte also documented the blockage of providers, through which Internet censorship and private surfing was possible, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">She reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12th we noticed how the blocking of web pages that VPNs offered began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the government's intention to continue to block and filter contents on which Egyptian users could have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "the situation is additionally worsened by the fact that the censorship decisions are taken behind closed doors, which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis with which it can act in court against these actions." ""</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day after day newspapers in whole of Brazil report dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "" "" "14-year-old was shot in school," "" "Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro" "", "" "" "Thieves rob pharmacy with military weapons," "" "President Timer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, Navy and air afee to Rio." ""</seg>
<seg id="2756">"" "" "" "in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level in Rio for 10 years." ""</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-government organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become common and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "the newspaper" "" "Extra" "" "known for detailed coverage of violence in Rio" "" "This is not normal" "" "in which it announced a new section called" "" "War in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The newspaper explained the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city on the world like murder, robbery, sexual abuse, etc. everything, however, deviates from the civilised standard and what happens only in Rio, will be published in the section "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative, so that as journalists, we do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, the editor-in-chief of the newspaper, stated that this decision was not a cause for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war rubrik in a country that doesn't recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a newspaper journalist explains that according to the Institute of Internal Security Studies in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the paper continues:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to obscure the atrocities of the police, who only shoots and then asks questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "War" harms more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist Cecília Oliveira, on the other hand, argues that violence as a "war." this is in their opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to accountability in the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and bad planning - as it has shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and self-complacent neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">As a reminder, the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than only its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2778">None of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "when we look at the murders per state, Rio is on No.16," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">Extra belongs to Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, like Cecília, has been repeating the state's security policy for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">These security policies also included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit imposed by the state of Rio in 2003, whose aim is to conquer a favela by deploying a massive police custody and permanently stationing a unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decrease of violent death cases. for a number of years, however, after several reports about harassment and repression against the poor communities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit, the UPP was increasingly under attack.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist João Paulo Charleaux cited one of his articles from the year 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also draws serious consequences for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This requires the state to use resources and ways that are typical of war. this includes intrusion into the territory of a "enemy," in which a Ziviist is an unsharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for "collateral damage" and "irrored balls."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War hin or forth, the fact is that the residents of the favelas continue to suffer in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2788">A week it is now time for the police to clench the mountain with the favela Jacarzinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence this incident also made headlines: a fruit salesman died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades primarily by the Assad regime towards loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories Worldwatch, a joint initiative of the peace organisation PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, are in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib currently about one million Syrians in a state of siege.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The East Ghouta region is particularly affected when an attack with chemical weapons on August 21, 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition are assuming that the Assad regime's massacre was perpetrated by the United Nations and other human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these areas controlled by rebel forces outside of Damascus have been under siege, leading to the fact that local residents are instructed locally or through tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through the years of blockages, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a return, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teaches the inhabitants of Eastern Ghoutas how they can plant their own mushrooms as "food-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Fungi do not belong to the common foods planted in Syria and are only rarely part of the Syrian kitchen. however, their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged east Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Direction of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we chose to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2814">To collect money for the initiative, we use the humanitarian crowdfunding platform Cando in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to give 125 families knowledge of planting mushrooms, says Dr. Leila zu Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of around 12.700 €, but will continue to collect donations to Cando until Monday, the 4th of September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the fuel shortage, locally produced fuels are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they started "production of mushrooms" from the regions before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption.</seg>
<seg id="2820">Then they planted a small mushroom graveyard in a tub. when this succeeded, they used a larger tank. and so on.</seg>

<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the government proclaimed a state of state last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hezb-e Wahhabi party, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara suddenly felt defenceless.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred of the Hazara, came closer and closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf resigned in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal pit. the work was difficult and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his low wages, and went to Iran. once again, he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortars which were heavier than himself, in order to earn his livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At the time of today, Afghan refugees in Iran were characterized by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"" "" "" "it was really hard," "" "Asharaf recalled in an interview with Global Voices." "" "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we also worked." ""</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services and no heating there. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we did not freeze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered shipwreck and landed on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Ashareh came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time, Asharaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church twice a day distributed food to needy people.</seg>
<seg id="2897">True, Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high acceptance rates. it is true, however, that the conditions that asylum seekers find in the country are disastrous.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that the system "suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000" "" "special reception centres." "" "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially placed an application for asylum - which can still be drawn after the registration of the asylum application for months.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who don't have money for an accommodation can either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unrestrained thread of life helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After several years of working in the construction industry, Asharaf put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while, he opened a second hostel and a snack bar.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis success story is now subject to the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian Luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film received the Venice City Award in 2017, which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are only a few of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to the official estimates, some 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years some Afghans run businesses, including dressmaking, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience, where the waiters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The dining card of the restaurant tells the story of her trip to Italy through the different Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the restaurant peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Asharqi's objectives extend far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and the retail trade and aim back to the country which he forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "where a risk is, there are also possibilities," "" "says Asharaf with a smile." "" "I want to invest in Afghanistan." ""</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I can't live happily if I know my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">"" "Asharaf also forges plans to open a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques." "" "so they can sell their crop surpluses on the market and improve their financial situation," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end there is stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharaf has made this journey himself. now he wants to help other Afghans on this road.</seg>

<seg id="2929">He reported on the clearing of the Raba'a el Adaweya camp in Cairo, which protested against the decomposition of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>

<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen Report is an international snapshot that illustrates challenges, victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament reviews a bill that foresees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after a registration with a government authority.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users would have to register to use social networks within six months following a successful legislative decision on the authority's website, stating their full name and ID number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who miss this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or the entitlement of a penal payment.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was promoted by sixty members of parliament, is currently ahead of the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "in May, another member of Parliament submitted a legislative proposal to be introduced in the tougher penalties for the insult of the President or a high officials." ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under the law proposition, such action would, however, be punished with prison and fines, as legal experts of Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is passed, this may mean up to three years imprisonment for the convicted.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"" "" "" "moreover, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years." ""</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian policemen while demonstrating violence against protesters who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of elected president Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan was waiting, as more than 700 protest participants, who had been arrested at the same incident, four years in detention to a trial date.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently his trial was postponed to 20 May because according to human rights groups, the prison management failed to bring the defendants from prison to the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan threatened the death penalty as a result of one, so many human rights groups agree, include a flooding of arms, illegal assembly, murder, and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a criminal court in Giza presented the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their reporting on the pro-Morsi session block at Raba'a al-Adawiya square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The Court also reduced the punishment of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the aforementioned incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activists intercepted to scanned documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, who co-founded the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy Project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was mainly interrogated with an inert plan of action. said Plan comes from the President of the Republic, who, according to the plan, explicitly supports a controversial bill of bills which would ensure the businessmen and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption if they return all unjustifiably preserved funds.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on the website of Nawaat on April 21, casts a light on how the preventive plans for supporting the bill look like.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia rejected the mention of his sources under specification of Article 11 of the Tunisian press code, which journalists have the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, he appeared in the district court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Will China force the users of social media to submit their identification?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to the new provisions of the Information Bureau of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China need permission before they write or share messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">In the provisions, it is also stated that registration will be required with the full real name.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts assume that by doing so, the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks should be reached. it is unclear to date how the authorities will apply these rules.</seg>
<seg id="2956">"" "" "" "Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to enforce these regulations only selective in order to protect citizen journalism and independence." ""</seg>
<seg id="2957">"" "do we see ourselves in" "" "WeChat" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">In May, the state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">According to Roskomnadzor, WeChat failed to register with the State Government as the "organiser of the dissemination of information."</seg>
<seg id="2961">This term is part of a law from the year 2014, thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that organize the "publication of information." the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for removing content and to force them on request to suspend user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These web pages currently include websites such as Vkontakte and Odnoxiniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the image board 2.ch.hk, the email service mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court has ban Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court ordered the Wikipedias ban in Turkey, after Wikipedia administers refused to clear two English-language articles, the particulars, Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">The Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communication abandoned the site because it became "a source of information that collaborates with groups to join a political diffusion campaign against Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website. it is therefore, among other things, China, one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">UK may not cease to sniff</seg>
<seg id="2968">After this week-fed documents, the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor programs that decrypt data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecommunications companies and intelligence services with regard to the proposal, but has launched other technology companies and the civilian population outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation runs until May 19. reactions and suggestions on the part of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
