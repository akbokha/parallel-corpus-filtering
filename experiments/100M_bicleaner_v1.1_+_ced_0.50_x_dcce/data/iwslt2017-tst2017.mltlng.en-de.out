that is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times re@@ porter .
long before one of Edward Snow@@ den had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that the N@@ SA has illeg@@ ally listened to teleph@@ ones of Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation , in which the CIA was literally giving Iran sket@@ ches for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter did not like at all ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years , the government has been investigating Ris@@ en and called on him to call his alleged sources .
in this turn he became a symbol of the pattern of government , whist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to condemn and spy on journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous ones that they give .
so when the government kno@@ cked on the ris@@ ons , he did something that many courageous re@@ porters did before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to jail .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to prison .
but then , just days before the process , something unusual happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , although they stated for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government in Ris@@ en were dropped . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , the re@@ porters and sources can always hide less .
instead of failing and releasing ris@@ ers , that could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , hid his telephone records secretly ,
just like his email data , financial and bank information , his credit return , and even travel information with the list of flights .
in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whist@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ ens supposedly source .
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised with his accession to protect whist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary has more than condem@@ ning all US governments .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whist@@ leb@@ lower to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we therefore put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional amend@@ ment , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just as technology allows the government to b@@ ypass the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and they can do so from the moment they contact , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness .
today there is communication software that did not exist when ris@@ en wrote his book , and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls .
such a technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source revision system for whist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and today has been further developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation .
instead of sending an email , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post here .
there you can upload documents or send information , just as with any contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government can no longer obtain information secretly , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset .
but Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new pi@@ on@@ age technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze us all .
it is important to us to ensure that not only techn@@ ologists such as Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to bear their wrong@@ doing . it is just as important that we protect the next whist@@ leb@@ lower ,
who knows about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the supply of soldiers and wants to report from over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environ@@ ment@@ alist who al@@ erts the alarm to contaminated water from F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street insi@@ ders who warns us of the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes , but to protect our constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 , the biggest data le@@ ak of history was published . &#93; &#91; Panama Papers &quot; reveal that rich and powerful &#93; &#91; enormous sums of money have hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to have an explanation . &#93; this week we were informed of news about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ bag Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set it up ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has already resulted in very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ ig@@ ned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has brief@@ ed companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is claimed that a track of $ 2 billion will lead to Russian President Vladimir Putin , a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ list .
now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others waiting nerv@@ ously for the next release , and to the next enth@@ r@@ alling documents .
now it sounds like the plot of an agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should that happen to us ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
media and leading politicians all over the world discuss how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide and veil their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people are very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ yo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these signs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is also interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the USA .
presumably because there were no prominent Americans until now , who in these revelations came to this sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but by the principle behind which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ bag Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a le@@ ak of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , in some U.S. states you need less information to provide less information to start a company than to get a library card .
this kind of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a concealed investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 Bar Associ@@ ations in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator turned out to be an African Minister who wanted to bring susp@@ icious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
it really shocked us that all of them had suggested a lawyer to our investig@@ ator how he could transfer his money .
none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course no one was given money to anybody , but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as individual cases .
it is not about a single lawyer submitted to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator proposals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not about a single leader , involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about how the system works , through corruption , ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to cope with this , we have to change the rules of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior harder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that may sound very tri@@ b@@ ably as if we could do nothing about it ; as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist I see that things have begun to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last few years we have seen violations of more transparency in terms of the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU is in central registers at national level , who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls them .
one of the uncomfortable facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
representatives of both parties have introduced a draft law in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to provide more transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who get angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bog@@ us companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy that stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders who recognize the problem and use laws to end this kind of in@@ transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together we can finally end the transparency that now allows this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story of how I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a ticket sale .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my things .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me about how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake asking him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing even worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , man !
what am I doing now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans this . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I lay in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what did I rock in ?
a wild stranger sleeps in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what if he is mad ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got such a fear that I stepped out of the bed on toes to the door , and my bedroom door closed .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art that he had bought from me hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
that was my first experience as a host . it changed my point of view completely .
perhaps the people who were sold to me as foreigners were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered ?
to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s make a jump , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost pl@@ ough , my room@@ mate draws out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all the hotels were fully booked .
I believe creativity can create it to transform fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I think about how we could earn something . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , plus a mattress and breakfast each morning .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and established &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep on wooden floors for 20 dollars on the air mattress .
they found it super , and we also .
I am sure our cheese ham quin@@ tet ta@@ sted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed .
had we just discovered that we were at the same time finding new friends and paying our rent ?
things came rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if we could make a business concept from it .
so we presented to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when you visit .
over the internet , they can invite foreign people to stay with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this will be the next big thing ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were waiting for the missi@@ le to ign@@ ite .
but they did not .
nobody , who is still in con@@ sol@@ ation , would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in homes of other people .
why ?
because we as children all have learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you are contempl@@ ating the things you can do well . we were able to design .
at the Academy of Art , we had learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before .
can design make something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree of confidence we asp@@ ire to .
it &apos;s a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left sitting neighbour .
this quiet touch of panic you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in his hands ?
most people feel the responsibility .
so most of the guests feel that they stay overnight somewhere else .
only for this reason can our company exist .
just like that , who now actually has Al Gor@@ es mobile ?
could you please announce on Twitter that he is chann@@ eling for the office of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had imagined with his name ; if he had told wh@@ ence he came from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine that you would have 150 jud@@ gements that everyone says : &quot; he can really hold on very well @-@ sprung hand ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to hand off your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust decisi@@ vely .
in the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for people to give negative jud@@ gements .
finally , we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had submitted their assessments before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are about age and residence .
not surprisingly we trust the people who are the most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting when you add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by jud@@ gements .
if you have less than three assessments , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation bl@@ ends common ground .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
in addition , we learned that trust depends on how much you get from yourself .
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too much , such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal level of openness , such as &quot; great works of art in your apartment ! I will go on holiday with my family . &quot;
how can you create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
what we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down those prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
first , incredibly good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third , a need that had not been covered before .
the business is running very well for us .
of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate parties or have devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have let guests stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I only think about it .
the dis@@ appointment that we hear in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million spent nights had a problem .
for people were right to trust each other .
if trust functions , it can be wonderful .
one of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attacks because of se@@ d@@ entary actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save lives , even though they don &apos;t know at all .
you go to the hospital in your own car when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want to feel lonely , they bring books past .
they can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , not every stay will exp@@ ire .
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
it is about economic trade here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now just call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing doesn &apos;t do justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people lay out a part of themselves , and that changes everything .
if you travel nowadays , it &apos;s easy to compare with fast food . it &apos;s efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what if travel would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if in any place you visit , a group there would wait to fill you thoroughly and show you a pub craw@@ l quarter , of which one has never heard before ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to shape apartments from scratch ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of common participation ?
I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships , rather than lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking lots owned by the government ,
were now offered residents . students who were looking for a stay ,
were taught to people whose children were withdrawn . incub@@ ator programs were started ,
to be able to finance new start @-@ ups in the share economy . today overnight 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guests with a stranger or even host .
the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
hospitality has been there before .
there were similar sites in front of us .
so why did our work just work ?
apart from happiness and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find it amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da goes past me .
we know , of course , that design cannot solve every problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use in the future .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or oppressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in the che@@ que che@@ que at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t blame you for your negative impressions .
so the media portra@@ y people who look like me .
one study found that 80 % of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : the Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a Mön@@ cht@@ eg@@ ern @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born so .
I have decided to do so .
when I was 17 , I made the decision to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual man , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time , it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , compared to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only adopted the faith of my parents .
I have strug@@ gled with the Qur &apos;an .
I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted and finally believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was trust and slow devotion , which deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
have you ever felt that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , you fully understand , and yet loves you ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I married and started , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot;
then came the aw@@ ful morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast in the end , looked up on the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breaking News &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , planes flew in buildings , people jump@@ ed out of the buildings .
what was this ?
an accident ?
a technical distur@@ b@@ ance ?
my shock turned quickly into ou@@ trage .
why should one do such things ?
I changed the television channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; Eastern ancest@@ ry ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; was bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh my God .
not only has my country been attacked , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others transformed me from a citizen into a susp@@ ects .
on the same day we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and start the post@@ graduate course .
I remember , as we drove in silence -- so deep it went to my seat , and I was afraid of being recognized as a Muslim for the first time .
we moved this night into our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ay in well @-@ lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t be sam@@ pled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed indoors all week .
then it became Friday in that week -- the day Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive reporting .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard from attacks on Muslims , or by people that were held for Muslims , drag@@ ged into the free and struck .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have war@@ med the anger of the people onto the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to have to explain itself constantly .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nowadays we can actually say people say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as of a tumor in the body of the USA .
it is only the question : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only kept under observation .
the alternatives are fu@@ tile , because the question is wrong .
Muslims , like all other Americans , are not a tumor in the body of the United States , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , hel@@ pers and Olympi@@ ans .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America more secure ?
there will perhaps be a few parking places free , but not stop the terror .
the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to look more toler@@ ant to people of other fai@@ ths , and to show greater ci@@ vic participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told me : people are actually not radic@@ alized in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alized in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
in the case of the radic@@ alisation process , one has found that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from her church , even from her family , so that the extrem@@ ist group can do a bra@@ in@@ washing that causes the people to believe that the terrorists are true Muslims , and anyone who abh@@ ors their behaviour and ideology is a tra@@ itor or fallen away from faith .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we have to stop people to go to the mos@@ que .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imag@@ inations if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , like the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups assert their ideology in their &quot; holy book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when you look at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scriptures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that makes them read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she preferred to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy with whom she spoke , she sil@@ enced and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that would make sense of her anger , she was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised her a solution .
this Ima@@ m made the connection with God and her church again .
instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia is concerned with me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ logical studies -- show that if we fear , at least three things happen .
we rather accept an authorit@@ arian system of governance , conformity and prejudi@@ ce .
a study shows : if you submit messages that have been reported neg@@ atively about Muslims , they rather vo@@ iced military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumc@@ ision of American Muslim rights .
this is not only an academic problem .
if you look when the mood against Muslims flow@@ ed upward -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq War and during two periods of election .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to raise the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all .
when referring to collective guilt , it is not only about having to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
he was talented at the faculty of denti@@ stry , promising , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when is such an accomplished young man from my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as in a execution , after he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot eight times in De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or were we safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about which America we want to surrender to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely ex@@ ert our religion .
we decided for the mos@@ que .
with our son in our children &apos;s seat , we drove sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took him out , pulled my shoes off , went to the hall of prayer , and what I saw let me keep .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assemblies were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at this moment I am collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had preferred panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be sure to go number safe ?
or you will join those who think : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what you say to those who may claim that you &apos;re holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a mind@@ set with drau@@ ght , work in a pos@@ h think factory , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ a@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t dec@@ eive myself . I am completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
if you look at Muslims around the world , and I did this with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I &apos;m not an exception in any way .
when people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ a@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a multi @-@ billion dollar business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the potential applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before blowing air pack@@ ets into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the F@@ RAC Centre in France has built a six @-@ metre high tower of 1 500 tiles live in front of the audience . some years ago , they began to fly with ropes .
by connecting , air units reach high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test space .
you can also build self @-@ reli@@ able structures .
they have learned to bear burdens , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally react to natural laws .
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to transc@@ end the limits of possibilities in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it must be collectively known where mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at the ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects , which enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new localization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine the calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available on the highest flat@@ ness e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; starting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; landing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear @-@ starter ,
a flight unit that tries to beat two flies with a flap .
like other starter motors , it is efficient in the forward flight , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations .
in contrast to most star@@ ters it can float , and therefore has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a restriction of rear star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that no matter what position the flight unit can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research , we often pose fundamental abstract issues that are at the core of the matter .
for example , such a question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that join together to hurt you .
decades ago trained pilots were able to fly remote @-@ controlled aircraft that had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a rear ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying with only one works .
this is the mechan@@ ic , the mechan@@ ically most remote controlled aircraft . it was invented recently .
it has only one movable part , a prop@@ eller ,
no valves , hing@@ es and cross rods , no further actuators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechanical simple , inside life happens very much so that it can fly stable , and can move anywhere in the room .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern @-@ star@@ ters . to get it to fly , I have to throw it right .
the likel@@ ihood of watching it right when viewing all is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
if the monster is an exercise in amus@@ ement , this machine is here , the bus with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that he is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
as a result , he receives the utmost skill ,
moving in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is turned or even as it rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive flows from the eight prop@@ ellers .
some things can be imagined in models , the rest is learned directly from flying .
let &apos;s look at it .
when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
this turns clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
when you build them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
if something goes wrong -- an engine or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine further , albeit limited .
we will now demonstrate this by in@@ capable of one half .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took commercially available micro @-@ cop@@ ter - each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where it is in space and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully , you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to re@@ think new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine , on Broadway , wants to become a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology .
for types like us the reward lies in the development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , intelligent creations to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed each other in a very far distant galax@@ y , so the mass of three suns turned into pure energy in a tenth of a second .
for this short moment they lit more bri@@ ghtly than all stars in all galax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big boy .
but they did not put their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the whole energy was released into space @-@ time @-@ space itself and the universe explo@@ ded into gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us sort the occur@@ ren@@ ces in the first place .
more than 1.3 billion years ago , multi @-@ cell life was born on Earth .
since then the earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God stands at -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago a group of particularly courageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravit@@ ational waves , which are caused by colored black holes .
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser @-@ interfer@@ ometer @-@ gravit@@ ational @-@ shaft @-@ observ@@ atory .
in the following period , the precision of Lig@@ o was substantially increased , which greatly improved the recognition capacity .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , stub@@ born problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gravit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes rus@@ hed through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the good@@ bye to my death @-@ sick father .
basically it was the fruits of my life .
all that I worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gravit@@ ational waves from black holes and their through observ@@ atories as lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . what are gravit@@ ational waves ?
a gravit@@ ational wave is a c@@ ud@@ d@@ ling in the fabric of space and time .
when moving the shaft , the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and st@@ amped into the other .
for illustration , teachers often perform a properly Alpine dance in the theory of rel@@ ativity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stretch and dust , stretch and dust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the problem is that gravit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous , are .
on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and st@@ owed by us when the waves arrive . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
this means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a followed by a 1 . that &apos;s why the Lig@@ o employees were going crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometer laser detector , and that is already absurd , this length would have to be measured at less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of an atomic nucle@@ us . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classical text about gravit@@ ation
&quot; &quot; &quot; described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , hunting for the waves as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are huge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will certainly be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength that is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell .
this is quite practical , because so you can customize a picture or a map of things by seeing the light coming from several points around you .
when it comes to tones , that is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that will mean a great deal to you :
for example , the face of your child .
instead we listen to certain properties like pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now is just Alice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts her . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; du@@ mmer Bob &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same goes for gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we can &apos;t make any simple pictures of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so if we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe speak .
to listen to the gravity can tell us about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a very long time .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just chir@@ p : w@@ up@@ p !
rotating the two bodies very quickly , one hears the same pen with an additional key change . this sounds like W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed in the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render sound &#93; Som@@ ebody who knows what to hear , recognizes this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which rotate around as fast as the rods of your mixer .
AA : let &apos;s talk about what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , cir@@ cling a hundred times per second before they colli@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know about it because we heard it .
therein lies the permanent meaning of Lig@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to explore the universe as it was never before . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on this path we can listen to the All and hear the invisible .
much in space we can -- practically or basically -- not to see .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in Super@@ nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . we have learned a lot from them all over the universe .
the exciting physical processes happen at the core , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see through , as these op@@ a@@ que are .
gravit@@ ational @-@ waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it as the Big B@@ ang is concealed by its own after@@ glow .
using gravit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back at the beginning .
and most importantly , I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen , we will never see , and of which we have no idea . things we only discover by listening .
in fact Lig@@ o found things right in the first run that we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this subject : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , as Lig@@ o ob@@ serves them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are the sour cher@@ ubs for our arch@@ eological work so to speak .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different point of view of the events in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately on how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge is to be as courageous as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and pen of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and All .
for what could be nic@@ er than listening to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of big dreams .
you can dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried out an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a year , I would say to all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; Yes . &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start playing with the show ?
no , no , no , but yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I feared , removed my fear .
my fear of keeping speeches , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed my life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain yes that deeply changed my life on an unexpected way . it started with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my beak @-@ cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she asked her once if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was the beginning
a new attitude to life in my family . from then on , I have to play with them whenever you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I am not perfect , but I am very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , on our family .
but it also has a start@@ ling side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; -@@ say to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I &apos;m a writer . I think things out , aw@@ aken your life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I created television . I produce television .
I do television , in a grand style .
in this TV @-@ season I am responsible for carrying 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programmes , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode every nine days four shows , so all nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts that are simultaneously in production , 15 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America , my TV series are running on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I have created myself , and not only produced , so on top of it . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather around my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires burning around the world .
do you know who is doing that yet ?
nobody , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think , when the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you so that all of you who work as hard as you now have a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a household , take me seriously if I speak of work so you understand that I &apos;m not just working on the computer and imagin@@ ative , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it &apos;s not about dre@@ aming in a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , everything reality , everything blood , everything sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I am deep@@ ened into the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it &apos;s like I set troops on , as I painted on a canvas .
so , as you carry a high tone , deliver a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love working .
she is creative , mechanical , ar@@ du@@ ous and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible . and the best part is the sum .
there is such a change in me when the work is going well .
a bu@@ zz@@ ing begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz@@ ing sounds like a busy street , I could drive on it forever .
many people assume that when I declare to them the sums , I &apos;m writing about writing that writing gives me joy .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , that &apos;s what it does .
but the sums -- when I began working and working with television , when I began to work and work and work , I discovered this thing , this sums , this energy .
the sums are more than writing .
the sums are action and activity . the sums are a drug .
the sums are music . the sums are light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a tot@@ em , you can not strive other than size .
the feeling of not being able to be different than striving for size doesn &apos;t matter at what price .
this is called the sums .
or perhaps it means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it &apos;s the genius .
perhaps it &apos;s called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I know only that I am not made for failure , and I only know that I love the sums .
I just want to tell you I am a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make one thing clear : the more successful I become , the more broad@@ casts , the more episodes , the more work there is , the more I &apos;m writing history , the more I write history , the more I write history .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the sums , the sums , the sums .
I like this bu@@ zz . I love the sums .
I need the sums . I am the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
am I only this sums ?
and then the sums stopped .
over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ loaded , over@@ loaded , burnt out .
the sums were stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mother is a single working title .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Look , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are Baby Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the tot@@ als stopped .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing of the engine stopped .
I didn &apos;t love my job any more . the engine was out .
the sums were not returned .
my sums were broken .
I made the same things as always : the same tit@@ anic work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ated , a titanium does not sleep , does not give up , with whole heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no bu@@ zz .
inside me was silence .
four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four .
four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a preview Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
all I did .
I was the sums and the sums I was .
so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade away ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how@@ l , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you are doing it , you do , you are working , you love what you are doing , being a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you simply love another and that gives you the sums when you know the tot@@ em , when the sums are stopped , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , I can survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late on it and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no when two things become aware of me :
first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she did not call me &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she does not call anyone more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when is that happening ?
I miss it when I am Titan and my tot@@ em smo@@ kes , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read very dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and in the absence of the sum@@ mons , I cannot do anything except to watch out .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the country I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and moist kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax pens and the song in which it is about letting go , or whatever the girl leaves in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere peace and simplicity are everywhere .
the air in this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me solves .
a mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in .
and that not immediately , but it happens it happens .
I feel it .
the sums are slowly coming back .
no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the sums , but a sum .
and now I feel as though I know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sums , the working sums , the titanium hum@@ ming , this is only the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself with the help of broad@@ casts and TV hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is .
the sums are not force and it is not work @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real sums depend on love .
the sums are the current that comes from the lust of life .
the real bu@@ zz is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real bu@@ zz ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be experienced , the expectation and the pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the true tot@@ em is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words to me , for which God told me that I am a titanium ?
it is simply love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself from any guilt as a work@@ ah@@ olic .
it is law , I have no other choice . I don &apos;t have any other choice unless I want to hear the sums again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not just about how to work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work , because I love it .
I prefer at work than at home .
this admission is painful , because what a person would rather work than to be home ?
well , I .
let &apos;s face it , I call myself &quot; Titan . &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of it .
we run around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
in doing so , I feel overwhel@@ med , absent and confused .
I always use my mobile phone .
but it is OK .
my children show me how to live , and the tot@@ aling of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also say yes , if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you consider me na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dream .
you &apos;re right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et Show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something different .
it &apos;s wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bird or bis@@ cuit will replace me .
and when my teen girl speaks with me for 15 minutes , I am the mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , there is no need for it .
everyone can bring up 15 minutes a day , even on a bad day !
15 minutes a day !
no cell phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to pray .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my delight , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the tot@@ als , to have a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
to play the game in general .
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and store it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I won and I win . meet friends , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in the training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes on a track , why not treat yourself for full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sums came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
works do not work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy streams in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the sums , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sums , the sums are not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinners with friends .
this is my sum .
the sums of life .
the sum of love .
the sum of the work is part of me , but just a part . and for that I am so grateful .
it is sn@@ u@@ ff to me that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , the journey to Jerusalem is playing .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet , I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children are .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the more clear my head is .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sums . the land I create , the marathon I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high tone , the sums , the sums , the other , the real bu@@ zz : the sums of life .
the more I feel this sums , the more this unusual , consistent , naked and new feeling of life in me grows . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel that sums , the more I know who I am .
I &apos;m a writer . I think things out , I &apos;ll catch you to life .
this belongs to the job , which means living his dream .
that is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks a lot .
I am Neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to another after a serious stroke or a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing .
after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I have been a functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical procedures .
they have certainly heard of one of the most famous , the &quot; brain stimulation . &quot; an electrode im@@ planted deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function improves .
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s who suffered under severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help , the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was a senior doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room .
I often provided patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
you have to imagine that the brain sw@@ ells with skull @-@ brain trau@@ mas and increases the skull &apos;s pressure .
in order to save life , one has to reduce the pressure of the skull .
sometimes you have to remove part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to allow cells to grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and the surroundings to make them thri@@ ve .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François succeeded .
he saw that under his microscope .
that was a great surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly as a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they split very quickly .
they never die , they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they split slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our cereb@@ ell@@ ar rin@@ ds .
they play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fet@@ us they provide for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them at higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so sure .
one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and then mark them in colour to be able to track them in the brain .
in the last step we re @-@ wrote them at the site of the same individual .
we call it aut@@ olog@@ ous transplantation -- auto transplantation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we re @-@ plan these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen when we re @-@ plan the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario , we re @-@ re @-@ ro@@ uted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were taken again , they go back home . the space is already occupied , they are not needed , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we had an injury and they re @-@ used exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you can see what we could observe under the microscope .
these are the cells that have been re @-@ consul@@ ted .
the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells we dy@@ ed in vitro , in culture .
of course we could not stop here .
can these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food pellets from a tablet .
that made them very good .
when they reached a stable skill level , we injured the mot@@ oric cor@@ tex in the mot@@ oric cor@@ tex .
then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand any more .
just as it would happen in people , they recovered spontaneously to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just like the monkey .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left you can see the monkey , which refres@@ hed spontaneously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now , see when we re @-@ re @-@ en@@ acted the cells : the same monkey , two months after rice plant@@ ation .
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found out a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to implant them in humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Giussani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I am sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical trials on humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results one has to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this type of studies .
BG : that &apos;s understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue looking forward to the future , how many years will it take until someone can come to the hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : it &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will it allow us the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate if it is useful to do this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply it to a multic@@ enter study .
first you have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to look at them as imm@@ utable things .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great followers in Beijing proved indisp@@ utable that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact democracy is d@@ wind@@ ling with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally made clear to me as the finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- would not influence the austerity programs that were realised in Greece .
at that moment , I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sincere friends who told me that democracy would be aboli@@ shed if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to present you an economical model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group succ@@ um@@ bed to an error , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ en@@ sible democracy .
for without democracy our societies are painted , our future is dark and our great new technologies wa@@ sted .
on the subject of waste I would like to draw you attention to an interesting contradiction that currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin @-@ summit parad@@ ox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt mountain that thro@@ ws his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the debt @-@ mountain ,
but few recognise his twin .
a mountain of unused cash , which is part of the wealthy depos@@ itors and corporations , which , however , are too sc@@ ary to invest where it would be productive and income that could produce the debt and also produce all the things humanity desper@@ ately needs , such as &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars have been invested in the United States , England and the euro@@ zone , in all the prosperity of producing goods such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on .
3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until one compar@@ es it with the 5,@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did nothing except to infl@@ ate the stock markets and raise the real estate prices .
thus debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin @-@ tops that are not offset by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and consequently a low macro@@ economic demand , which , as in a continuous loop , promotes the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which , from fear , the Proph@@ ecy of the Whe@@ el could be true that his son would kill him when he grows up ,
in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently causes the circumstances causing pus to s@@ lay him .
that is my stri@@ fe with capitalism --
&quot; &quot; &quot; his extremely wast@@ eful article All the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
of course , the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy included too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of ath@@ en@@ ian democracy based on these exclu@@ sions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive thing about the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it applied the working arms and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and more decisive , which they gave them the right to political participation with equal voting in questions of state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not lasted long -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
like a candle that shines very bright , it is also quickly burnt out .
however , our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies have not roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American Constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working arms , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , which in the end was a statute for rulers .
for the liberal democracy first emerged as a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- became a democracy @-@ free zone .
in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two took place , by gradually shifting politics and em@@ power@@ ing them .
are you wondering why the politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not due to a degeneration of their DNA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is because you can be in the government today , but still not in power , because the power is diver@@ ted from politics into the economy and the areas are separated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that sustain@@ ably decim@@ ated the animals they feed on , that they are star@@ ving at the end .
similarly , it is with the economy that poli@@ tic@@ ises politics so far that it har@@ ms itself through the self @-@ created economic crisis itself . the power of corporations grows , political goods are de@@ valued , the ine@@ quality falls , the macro@@ economic demand falls and the corporate managers are too sc@@ ary to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; out of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the wa@@ sting of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind .
if this is true , it is obvious that we have to bring the politics and economy together again , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; keeps control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not seem very good .
the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new ways of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : to aboli@@ sh the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers through automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as the economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin summit higher , the waste more sub@@ lime , and the social conflicts lower , as it is -- very soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come .
we have to re @-@ shape the economy and re@@ unite the fields of business and politics , and make sure that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ unified area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cracy that lets the film &quot; Matrix &quot; appear like a documentation .
the question therefore is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements it has produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that in &quot; Matrix , &quot; or by something similar to the society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines are used to put their energy into the exploration of the universe , or to indul@@ ge in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long talks the meaning of life .
I think we must be optimistic .
so what would it take , how could it look like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation I would like to give you , in brief , some examples .
in the field of companies : please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital takes you from one office to the next , from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter where you are working -- is the property of those currently working in the company .
then all revenues come from capital and from revenues and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ taken .
no distinction between those who belong to the company but do not work in it , and employees working there that the company does not belong to . no exchange between capital and labour , no gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no rising twin peaks .
in the field of global political economy , please make sure that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interests of all humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund .
imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John Ma@@ yn@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed at the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
today we have it , especially against the backdrop of a re@@ unified politics and economy .
the world I describe is at the same time the Liber@@ al , in which she pre@@ fers privileged people , and Marxist , because she is buried the separation of capital and labour in the bin of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global Key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all , it is a world where we can imagine real democracy .
we will wake up in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... we do not do this , technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers is called &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next , as we currently experience it , it will not only destabili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant ,
as Hay@@ ek , therefore I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am also perfect .
BG : actually , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually , it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the or@@ ators you have very clearly said what you think of the West &apos;s view of China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of democracy .
as I said in my talk , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most is playing -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic zone .
in a sense , if I can say that so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China resembles the England of the 19th century .
because -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is an error , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what one can see now in China resembles very much the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
to blame China now , what the West has done itself in the 19th century , sm@@ ells enormous after hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experience as the Greek finance minister at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I guess that is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later for the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to start a new start with the Eurozone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is to say good@@ bye to the self @-@ compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the continual den@@ ial that a solid fault line passed through the euro@@ zone , and continues to be mas@@ sively threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , based on Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal that revealed this den@@ ial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the Euro Group , still have chosen den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what is coming .
that is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if one tries to maintain an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and authorit@@ ari@@ anism , one may be able to delay it for a while , but if the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you see in advance ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its construction .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone looking back -- Seri@@ ousness ...
if there is a Minister of Finance , or any Minister , who has been in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he did not make any mistakes , then it is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the request for extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the side of the len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but there was no such thing .
they only wanted to bring our government down , only because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that ran through the Eurozone .
they didn &apos;t want to admit that they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s credi@@ tors , who imposed this policy on us , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for if they do not survive , the exposed centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , according to which it appears to me , it will be equally detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you are wrong in this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being at TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
most of the time Roy Price has never heard , even though he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision that Roy hit three years ago .
Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a hed@@ geho@@ g and describes on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movies , TV , technique , tac@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for searching the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course this is a very hard @-@ fought branch .
there are already so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t choose any one .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right side of this curve .
this curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating is from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows received this review .
if your show is scored with nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that make addic@@ ts where , after you have watched a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what &apos;s going on at this end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to for@@ bid &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the medium size , the average television -- the shows , which are neither good nor bad , they simply do not impress .
so he must make sure he &apos;s really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it is also the first time Amazon is doing something like that , that &apos;s why Roy Price does not want to risk anything .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he is holding a competition .
he takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where they can watch them for free .
and if Amazon is out for nothing , do you access , right ?
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
however , they do not know they will be watched while watching these shows .
they are observed by Roy and his team who record everything .
you record when you start the show when you pause , which parts you skip or look again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce with these data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process it and this results in the answer , and this reads : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many people can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
approximately at the same time with another company another manager placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking for this to find a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different .
instead of organizing a contest , he and his team watched the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they give the shows , their course , what shows they like etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , what producers , what actors ?
when they had all the pieces together they went a risk and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course , the question is : what has happened here ?
it has two very competitive , data @-@ vers@@ ed companies .
they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic says somehow that it should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data for a decision you make , you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work , then this is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time in which we use more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software . come into contact with it , you are in prison .
if someone is in prison here in the US and asks for dis@@ mis@@ sal , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether or not a discharge occurs .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding if a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are produced . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the most experienced companies are wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that through data analysis , they can predict out@@ breaks of influ@@ enza , the bad way -- through data analysis of Google searches .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked fine , year around year , until it didn &apos;t work any more ,
and no one could say why .
it simply did not work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data of most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
in spite of all these errors , data abo@@ und in decisions of life -- at work , in enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area where some very smart people can uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably use many data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you have to solve a complex problem , do basically two things :
first , dis@@ assemble this problem into its components , so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a second , you put the items together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to disman@@ tle a problem and to understand its parts .
they are not suitable to assemble the parts and then come to a decision .
for this there is another tool and we all possess it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is to put parts and pieces together again , even if the information is incomplete , then a good decision - especially if it is the brain of an expert .
that &apos;s why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and reason , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have not been able to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts back together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; is not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant that they took a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first when they were competing for TV ideas , than selecting &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what the data tell us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe things are going wrong when data start controlling our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data is just a tool , and in order to not forget this , this device is quite useful .
many of you will be ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no @-@ question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly prob@@ able &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will make it out later with a technical demonstration .
so far I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have listened to the ball afterwards .
but , as you can of course know , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them with something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so maybe the ball is wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays to make decisions , to be an expert in what you are doing and taking risks .
for in the end , it is not the data , but the risks that you end up at the right end of the curve .
thanks a lot .
