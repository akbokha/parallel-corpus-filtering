<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before one of Edward Snowden had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA has illegally listened to telephones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation, in which the CIA was literally giving Iran sketches for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter did not like at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government has been investigating Risen and called on him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn he became a symbol of the pattern of government, whistleblowers to condemn and spy on journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous ones that they give.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government knocked on the risons, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to jail.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the process, something unusual happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "suddenly, although they stated for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government in Risen were dropped." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, the reporters and sources can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failing and releasing risers, that could also do his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, hid his telephone records secretly,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his email data, financial and bank information, his credit return, and even travel information with the list of flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and Risens supposedly source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised with his accession to protect whistleblowers, but instead the judiciary has more than condemning all US governments.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "we therefore put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional amendment, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on everyone." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology allows the government to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And they can do so from the moment they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there is communication software that did not exist when risen wrote his book, and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such a technology is SecureDrop, an open source revision system for whistleblowers, originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and today has been further developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news website, just like the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, just as with any contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer obtain information secretly, and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">But SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new pionage technologies that jeopardize us all.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is important to us to ensure that not only technologists such as Edward Snowden have an opportunity to bear their wrongdoing. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">Who knows about grievances in the supply of soldiers and wants to report from overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmentalist who alerts the alarm to contaminated water from Flint. or a Wallstreet insiders who warns us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes, but to protect our constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016, the biggest data leak of history was published.] [Panama Papers "reveal that rich and powerful] [enormous sums of money have hidden in tax havens.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness to have an explanation.] this week we were informed of news about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mossack Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mosbag Fonseca and say:" "" "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set it up?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already resulted in very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has briefed companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a track of $2 billion will lead to Russian President Vladimir Putin, a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of richer people out there and others waiting nervously for the next release, and to the next enthralling documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of an agent or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems weep away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should that happen to us?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Media and leading politicians all over the world discuss how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and veil their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people are very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matryoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these signs.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it is also interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably because there were no prominent Americans until now, who in these revelations came to this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their wealth in tax havens." ""</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle behind which these tax havens work, Mosbag Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a leak of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, in some U.S. states you need less information to provide less information to start a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed scammers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a concealed investigator to the offices of 13 Bar Associations in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator turned out to be an African Minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">It really shocked us that all of them had suggested a lawyer to our investigator how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course no one was given money to anybody, but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer submitted to our covert investigator proposals.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "it's not about a single leader, involved in a scandal." ""</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, through corruption, evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we have to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior harder." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">That may sound very tribably as if we could do nothing about it; as if nothing had ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist I see that things have begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"" "" "" "in the last few years we have seen violations of more transparency in terms of the owners of companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU is in central registers at national level, who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the uncomfortable facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have introduced a draft law in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to provide more transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who get angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bogus companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need leaders in the economy that stand up and say:" "" "transparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leaders who recognize the problem and use laws to end this kind of intransparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "together we can finally end the transparency that now allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a ticket sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my things.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me about how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake asking him:" "" "where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing even worse:" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought, "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What am I doing now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans this. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard say:" "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "Oh, how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I lay in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought, "Oh man! what did I rock in?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">"" "what if he is mad?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I stepped out of the bed on toes to the door, and my bedroom door closed.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art that he had bought from me hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as a host. it changed my point of view completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me as foreigners were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's make a jump, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost plough, my roommate draws out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all the hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe creativity can create it to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I think about how we could earn something. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, plus a mattress and breakfast each morning.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and established "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep on wooden floors for 20 dollars on the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we also.</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure our cheese ham quintet tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I stared.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we were at the same time finding new friends and paying our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if we could make a business concept from it.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented to the investors: "we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when you visit.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the internet, they can invite foreign people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "this will be the next big thing!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="141">We were waiting for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they did not.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nobody, who is still in consolation, would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in homes of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children all have learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you are contemplating the things you can do well. we were able to design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Art, we had learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make something like that?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of what degree of confidence we aspire to.</seg>
<seg id="152">It's a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlocked mobile phone to your left sitting neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet touch of panic you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in his hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most people feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So most of the guests feel that they stay overnight somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just like that, who now actually has Al Gores mobile?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce on Twitter that he is channeling for the office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had imagined with his name; if he had told whence he came from, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine that you would have 150 judgements that everyone says: "he can really hold on very well-sprung hand!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to hand off your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-thought-out feedback system strengthens trust decisively.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to give negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">Finally, we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had submitted their assessments before we put them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are about age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Not surprisingly we trust the people who are the most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting when you add a person's call -- in our case by judgements.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three assessments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation blends common ground.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust depends on how much you get from yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you tell too little, like" "" "Hi!" "", "you don't get an answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "if you tell too much, such as" "" "I have problems with my mother" "" "-- -- the request is not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal level of openness, such as "great works of art in your apartment! I will go on holiday with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down those prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First, incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a need that had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">The business is running very well for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate parties or have devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have let guests stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked with customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I only think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that we hear in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million spent nights had a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people were right to trust each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust functions, it can be wonderful.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"" "" "" "perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attacks because of sedentary actions." ""</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives, even though they don't know at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">You go to the hospital in your own car when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want to feel lonely, they bring books past.</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, not every stay will expire.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is about economic trade here.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but now just call" "" "rental industry" "", "the thing doesn't do justice." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People lay out a part of themselves, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">If you travel nowadays, it's easy to compare with fast food. it's efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What if travel would be a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in any place you visit, a group there would wait to fill you thoroughly and show you a pub crawl quarter, of which one has never heard before;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to shape apartments from scratch?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of common participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships, rather than loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking lots owned by the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered residents. students who were looking for a stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were taught to people whose children were withdrawn. incubator programs were started,</seg>
<seg id="242">To be able to finance new start-ups in the share economy. today overnight 785 000 people in 191 countries will be guests with a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality has been there before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar sites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and timing, we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find it amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda goes past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, that design cannot solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use in the future.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the cheque cheque at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't blame you for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media portray people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">One study found that 80% of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who never met a Muslim: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A Mönchtegern-Fitness-Fanatikerin,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born so.</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I made the decision to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist friends were horrified:" "" "why do you suppress yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was: at that time, it was a feminist declaration of independence, compared to the pressure I felt as 17-year-old to adapt to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only adopted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have struggled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, questioned, doubted and finally believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was trust and slow devotion, which deepened with every reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Have you ever felt that someone perceives you, you fully understand, and yet loves you?</seg>
<seg id="287">That's how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and started, like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">Later, after my marriage, I had a child, and basically lived the "Egyptian-American Dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came the awful morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"" "I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast in the end, looked up on the screen and saw the word" "" "breaking News" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, planes flew in buildings, people jumped out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was this?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disturbance?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned quickly into outrage.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should one do such things?</seg>
<seg id="299">I changed the television channel and heard:... "Muslim terrorists..."... in the name of Islam... "..." Eastern ancestry... "..."... "Jihad..." ""... "was bombed Mecca!"</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">Not only has my country been attacked, but in the Nu the deeds of others transformed me from a citizen into a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day we had to drive through the Midwest of the USA to move to a new city and start the postgraduate course.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember, as we drove in silence -- so deep it went to my seat, and I was afraid of being recognized as a Muslim for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved this night into our apartment, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"" "and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said:" "" "be vigilant," "" "Be careful," "" "Stay in well-lit areas," "" "Don't be sampled." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed indoors all week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it became Friday in that week -- the day Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"" "and again the warnings said," "" "Don't go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive reporting.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard from attacks on Muslims, or by people that were held for Muslims, dragged into the free and struck.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">"" "" "" "I have warmed the anger of the people onto the terrorists." ""</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to have to explain itself constantly.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"" "nowadays we can actually say people say:" "" "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims." ""</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as of a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is only the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is only kept under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are futile, because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims, like all other Americans, are not a tumor in the body of the United States, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, helpers and Olympians.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America more secure?</seg>
<seg id="331">There will perhaps be a few parking places free, but not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to look more tolerant to people of other faiths, and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told me: people are actually not radicalized in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalized in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the case of the radicalisation process, one has found that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from her church, even from her family, so that the extremist group can do a brainwashing that causes the people to believe that the terrorists are true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behaviour and ideology is a traitor or fallen away from faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalisation, we have to stop people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imaginations if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam, like the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups assert their ideology in their "holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but when you look at them, they do not drive what they read in their" "" "Holy Scriptures." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that makes them read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she preferred to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergy with whom she spoke, she silenced and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that would make sense of her anger, she was a major goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised her a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam made the connection with God and her church again.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how the Islamophobia is concerned with me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neurological studies -- show that if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authoritarian system of governance, conformity and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: if you submit messages that have been reported negatively about Muslims, they rather voiced military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumcision of American Muslim rights.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not only an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look when the mood against Muslims flowed upward -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq War and during two periods of election.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool to manipulate the public to raise the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it first, but the toxic air of fear hurts us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">When referring to collective guilt, it is not only about having to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was talented at the faculty of dentistry, promising, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was amazed and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "when is such an accomplished young man from my brother?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered her, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was visiting the afternoon. he did it in her apartment, as in a execution, after he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot eight times in Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not only be immoral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or were we safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about which America we want to surrender to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely exert our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in our children's seat, we drove silently, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, pulled my shoes off, went to the hall of prayer, and what I saw let me keep.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the assemblies were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment I am collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had preferred panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be sure to go number safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or you will join those who think: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what you say to those who may claim that you're holding a TEDTalk, a mindset with draught, work in a posh think factory, so an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogaed: I would say, don't deceive myself. I am completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">If you look at Muslims around the world, and I did this with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I'm not an exception in any way.</seg>
<seg id="405">When people seem like an exception to rule, then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogaed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is about to become a multi-billion dollar business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the potential applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutions worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before blowing air packets into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the FRAC Centre in France has built a six-metre high tower of 1 500 tiles live in front of the audience. some years ago, they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting, air units reach high speed and acceleration in the tightest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-reliable structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to bear burdens, deal with turbulence and generally react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to transcend the limits of possibilities in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to work autonomously, it must be collectively known where mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at the ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects, which enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine the calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available on the highest flatness e. g." "" "starting" "" "and" "" "landing" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear-starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight unit that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starter motors, it is efficient in the forward flight, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most starters it can float, and therefore has great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of rear starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence like wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that no matter what position the flight unit can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often pose fundamental abstract issues that are at the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">For example, such a question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that join together to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago trained pilots were able to fly remote-controlled aircraft that had only two movable parts: a propeller and a rear rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the mechanic, the mechanically most remote controlled aircraft. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No valves, hinges and cross rods, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanical simple, inside life happens very much so that it can fly stable, and can move anywhere in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern-starters. to get it to fly, I have to throw it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood of watching it right when viewing all is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the monster is an exercise in amusement, this machine is here, the bus with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result, he receives the utmost skill,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions, no matter what direction it is turned or even as it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive flows from the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some things can be imagined in models, the rest is learned directly from flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at it.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two-propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other anti-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them together, they behave like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">If something goes wrong -- an engine or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine further, albeit limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this by incapable of one half.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigates synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercially available micro-copter - each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where it is in space and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, you motivate these demonstrations to rethink new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine, on Broadway, wants to become a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us the reward lies in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, intelligent creations to form them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled each other in a very far distant galaxy, so the mass of three suns turned into pure energy in a tenth of a second.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment they lit more brightly than all stars in all galaxies of the entire universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big boy.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not put their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The whole energy was released into space-time-space itself and the universe exploded into gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us sort the occurrences in the first place.</seg>
<seg id="476">More than 1.3 billion years ago, multi-cell life was born on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God stands at -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which are caused by colored black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the laser-interferometer-gravitational-shaft-observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following period, the precision of Ligo was substantially increased, which greatly improved the recognition capacity.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015 Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two colliding black holes rushed through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the goodbye to my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically it was the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves from black holes and their through observatories as ligo measurable signals. what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a cuddling in the fabric of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When moving the shaft, the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and stamped into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustration, teachers often perform a properly Alpine dance in the theory of relativity.</seg>
<seg id="496">"" "" "" "stretch and dust, stretch and dust." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous, are.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, each of us was stretched and stowed by us when the waves arrive. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">This means 20 zeros after the comma followed by a 1. that's why the Ligo employees were going crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometer laser detector, and that is already absurd, this length would have to be measured at less than a thousandth of the radius of an atomic nucleus. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"" "described Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, hunting for the waves as follows:" "" "the technical difficulties in building such detectors are huge." ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will certainly be overcome." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to say that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, because so you can customize a picture or a map of things by seeing the light coming from several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">When it comes to tones, that is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that will mean a great deal to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">For example, the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain properties like pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now is just Alice." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts her."</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "" "" "dummer Bob" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The same goes for gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can't make any simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe speak.</seg>
<seg id="522">To listen to the gravity can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a very long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, just chirp: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Rotating the two bodies very quickly, one hears the same pen with an additional key change. this sounds like Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Ligo heard the following: [Surrender sound] Somebody who knows what to hear, recognizes this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold solar mass, which rotate around as fast as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's talk about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circling a hundred times per second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about it because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the permanent meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">"" "" "" "Ligo paves a completely new way to explore the universe as it was never before." ""</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to the All and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can -- practically or basically -- not to see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in Supernovae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot from them all over the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes happen at the core, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through, as these opaque are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational-waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it as the Big Bang is concealed by its own afterglow.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And most importantly, I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, we will never see, and of which we have no idea. things we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact Ligo found things right in the first run that we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this subject: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, as Ligo observes them, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are the sour cherubs for our archeological work so to speak.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo gives us a completely different point of view of the events in space, the emergence of the stars and ultimately on how we emerged from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and pen of the cosmos.</seg>

<seg id="552">You can dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried out an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for a year, I would say to all" "" "Yes!" "" "I was afraid of." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">Whether it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, but yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: to do exactly what I feared, removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear of keeping speeches, my social anxiety -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "yes" "" "changed my life." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes that deeply changed my life on an unexpected way. it started with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, is called" "" "kitten," "" "for inexplicable reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "kittens, I need milk for my beak-cup." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">"" "she asked her once if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude to life in my family. from then on, I have to play with them whenever you ask me. no matter what I'm doing or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I am not perfect, but I am very tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, my children, on our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a startling side effect: only recently I fully understood that the "yes" -say to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I'm a writer. I think things out, awaken your life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I created television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I do television, in a grand style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV-season I am responsible for carrying 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programmes, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days four shows, so all nine days 20 million dollars television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts that are simultaneously in production, 15 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my TV series are running on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I have created myself, and not only produced, so on top of it. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather around my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is doing that yet?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">"" "I say it because I know what you think, when the word" "" "author" "" "falls." ""</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you so that all of you who work as hard as you now have a company, a country or a classroom, a business or a household, take me seriously if I speak of work so you understand that I'm not just working on the computer and imaginative, and it's true when I say: I understand that it's not about dreaming in a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, everything reality, everything blood, everything sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am deepened into the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It's like I set troops on, as I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">So, as you carry a high tone, deliver a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working.</seg>
<seg id="612">She is creative, mechanical, arduous and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and sensible. and the best part is the sum.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzzing begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzzing sounds like a busy street, I could drive on it forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume that when I declare to them the sums, I'm writing about writing that writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, that's what it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- when I began working and working with television, when I began to work and work and work, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums are more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums are action and activity. the sums are a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums are music. the sums are light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The humming is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a totem, you can not strive other than size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of not being able to be different than striving for size doesn't matter at what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it's the genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it's called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I know only that I am not made for failure, and I only know that I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you I am a Titan, and I know that I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make one thing clear: the more successful I become, the more broadcasts, the more episodes, the more work there is, the more I'm writing history, the more I write history, the more I write history.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land I created, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this buzz. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Overhauled, overloaded, overloaded, burnt out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums were stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mother is a single working title.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mum will not be there, but you can write my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says," "" "Look, I want to go to Shonda-Land." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the totals stopped.</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzzing of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job any more. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums were not returned.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums were broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same titanic work, 15 hours-days, worked weekends, no remorse, nothing delegated, a titanium does not sleep, does not give up, with whole heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no buzz.</seg>
<seg id="655">Inside me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programmes, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programmes, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a preview Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">All I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you do, the work you love, suddenly fade away?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think:" "" "howl, stupid author-Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you are doing it, you do, you are working, you love what you are doing, being a teacher, a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you simply love another and that gives you the sums when you know the totem, when the sums are stopped, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "southern states waitress" "" "asks me a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I'm on the way out, late on it and she says," "" "Mum, do you like playing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no when two things become aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I must say yes to everything and secondly, she did not call me "kitten."</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "she does not call anyone more" "" "kitten." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When is that happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I am Titan and my totem smokes, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mum, do you like playing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"" "and I say," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and their sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read very dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and panic, in loneliness and in the absence of the summons, I cannot do anything except to watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country I created, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky fingers and moist kisses, delicate voices, wax pens and the song in which it is about letting go, or whatever the girl leaves in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere peace and simplicity are everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me solves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that not immediately, but it happens it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums are slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, barely there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the sums, but a sum.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as though I know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the working sums, the titanium humming, this is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe myself with the help of broadcasts and TV hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums are not force and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums depend on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sums are the current that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real buzz is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real buzz ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be experienced, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The true totem is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words to me, for which God told me that I am a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is simply love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself from any guilt as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I don't have any other choice unless I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not just about how to work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer at work than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, because what a person would rather work than to be home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Let's face it, I call myself "Titan."</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of it.</seg>
<seg id="731">We run around in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">In doing so, I feel overwhelmed, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always use my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is OK.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the totaling of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say yes, if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you consider me naïve, for a daydream.</seg>
<seg id="742">You're right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet Show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes, until they think they want to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">It's wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybird or biscuit will replace me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And when my teen girl speaks with me for 15 minutes, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It is only 15 minutes, there is no need for it.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can bring up 15 minutes a day, even on a bad day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a day!</seg>
<seg id="754">No cell phone, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are ready to pray.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my delight, my world. it doesn't have to be the children. it is important to feel the totals, to have a place for peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">To play the game in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and store it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I won and I win. meet friends, read books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"" "" "" "do you want to play?" "" "is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in the training, when I wanted to surpass myself more and more." ""</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on a track, why not treat yourself for full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my spare time. the buzz seems to return if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Works do not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy streams in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the sums, the sums are not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinners with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sum.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sum of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sum of the work is part of me, but just a part. and for that I am so grateful.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is snuff to me that I am a Titan. I have never seen a Titan, the journey to Jerusalem is playing.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet, I have everything under control. my brain is still functioning. my campfire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children are.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the more clear my head is.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums. the land I create, the marathon I run, the troops, the canvases, the high tone, the sums, the sums, the other, the real buzz: the sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this sums, the more this unusual, consistent, naked and new feeling of life in me grows. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel that sums, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I'm a writer. I think things out, I'll catch you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">This belongs to the job, which means living his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">That is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>

<seg id="795">Thanks a lot.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another after a serious stroke or a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I have been a functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="804">They have certainly heard of one of the most famous, the "brain stimulation." an electrode implanted deep in the brain in order to influence the circuits of neurons in such a way that the neurological function improves.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's who suffered under severe tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was a senior doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often provided patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that the brain swells with skull-brain traumas and increases the skull's pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save life, one has to reduce the pressure of the skull.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To allow cells to grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and the surroundings to make them thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly as a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are immature cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they split very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They split slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our cerebellar rinds.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of the fetus they provide for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them at higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them in colour to be able to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we re-wrote them at the site of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call it autologous transplantation -- auto transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we re-plan these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen when we re-plan the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we re-re-routed the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were taken again, they go back home. the space is already occupied, they are not needed, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we had an injury and they re-used exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been re-consulted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells we dyed in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Can these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from a tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">That made them very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable skill level, we injured the motoric cortex in the motoric cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys were paralyzed, they couldn't move their hand any more.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in people, they recovered spontaneously to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just like the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you can see the monkey, which refreshed spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now, see when we re-re-enacted the cells: the same monkey, two months after rice plantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found out a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use it in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I am sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think: "I know someone who can do that."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical trials on humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results one has to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this type of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: that's understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue looking forward to the future, how many years will it take until someone can come to the hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: it's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate if it is useful to do this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply it to a multicenter study.</seg>
<seg id="897">First you have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to look at them as immutable things.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great followers in Beijing proved indisputable that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact democracy is dwindling with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was unequivocally made clear to me as the finance minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- would not influence the austerity programs that were realised in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment, I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my sincere friends who told me that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to present you an economical model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup succumbed to an error, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defensible democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy our societies are painted, our future is dark and our great new technologies wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of waste I would like to draw you attention to an interesting contradiction that currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twin-summit paradox." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debt mountain that throws his long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the debt-mountain,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognise his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which is part of the wealthy depositors and corporations, which, however, are too scary to invest where it would be productive and income that could produce the debt and also produce all the things humanity desperately needs, such as "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, 3,4 trillion US dollars have been invested in the United States, England and the eurozone, in all the prosperity of producing goods such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3,4 trillion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until one compares it with the 5,1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and did nothing except to inflate the stock markets and raise the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debt and unproductive capital form the twin-tops that are not offset by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the USA, Japan and Europe are unemployed, and consequently a low macroeconomic demand, which, as in a continuous loop, promotes the pessimism of investors, which, from fear, the Prophecy of the Wheel could be true that his son would kill him when he grows up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Inadvertently causes the circumstances causing pus to slay him.</seg>
<seg id="926">That is my strife with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"" "his extremely wasteful article All the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies," "" "green" "" "technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth." ""</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">Of course, the Athenian democracy included too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">"" "" "" "however, it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of athenian democracy based on these exclusions." ""</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive thing about the athenian democracy was and is that it applied the working arms and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and more decisive, which they gave them the right to political participation with equal voting in questions of state-of-the-law.</seg>
<seg id="935">"" "" "" "the Athenian democracy has not lasted long --" ""</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that shines very bright, it is also quickly burnt out.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our liberal democracies have not roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working arms, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which in the end was a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy first emerged as a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- became a democracy-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In today's democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two took place, by gradually shifting politics and empowering them.</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why the politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not due to a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"" "" "" "it is because you can be in the government today, but still not in power, because the power is diverted from politics into the economy and the areas are separated." ""</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of carnivores that sustainably decimated the animals they feed on, that they are starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is with the economy that politicises politics so far that it harms itself through the self-created economic crisis itself. the power of corporations grows, political goods are devalued, the inequality falls, the macroeconomic demand falls and the corporate managers are too scary to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism drives the "demos" out of democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the wasting of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If this is true, it is obvious that we have to bring the politics and economy together again, and it would be better if the "demos" keeps control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not seem very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new ways of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as the economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin summit higher, the waste more sublime, and the social conflicts lower, as it is -- very soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">We have to re-shape the economy and reunite the fields of business and politics, and make sure that we democratize the reunified area, otherwise we end up in a pathological surveillance hyperautocracy that lets the film "Matrix" appear like a documentation.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question therefore is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements it has produced --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that in "Matrix," or by something similar to the society in "Star Trek," in which machines are used to put their energy into the exploration of the universe, or to indulge in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "Agora," in long talks the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it take, how could it look like to have this "Star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "Matrix" -similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation I would like to give you, in brief, some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of companies: please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital takes you from one office to the next, from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter where you are working -- is the property of those currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all revenues come from capital and from revenues and the concept of wage labour is completely overtaken.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the company but do not work in it, and employees working there that the company does not belong to. no exchange between capital and labour, no gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no rising twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please make sure that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund] and the G-20 [group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interests of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the cosmos," in units of "cosmos" -- and each government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund is investing in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed at the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have it, especially against the backdrop of a reunified politics and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe is at the same time the Liberal, in which she prefers privileged people, and Marxist, because she is buried the separation of capital and labour in the bin of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world where we can imagine real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or will we sink into a" "" "Matrix" "" "- similar dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography as libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... we do not do this, technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which Larry Summers is called "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next, as we currently experience it, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, then Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">As Hayek, therefore I am a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am also perfect.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are well.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually, it was Einstein who said that. BG: in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the orators you have very clearly said what you think of the West's view of China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my talk, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most is playing -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a sense, if I can say that so provocative, China resembles the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">Because -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is an error, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberals, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What one can see now in China resembles very much the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">To blame China now, what the West has done itself in the 19th century, smells enormous after hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experience as the Greek finance minister at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I guess that is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later for the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start a new start with the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "that is to say goodbye to the self-complacency, and the continual denial that a solid fault line passed through the eurozone, and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the whole European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, based on Greek proposal -- by the way, the first proposal that revealed this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the Euro Group, still have chosen denial." ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">That is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries to maintain an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and authoritarianism, one may be able to delay it for a while, but if the change occurs, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see in advance?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its construction.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: anyone looking back -- Seriousness...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a Minister of Finance, or any Minister, who has been in office after 6 months, especially in such a tense situation, he did not make any mistakes, then it is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the request for extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the side of the lenders to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But there was no such thing.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They only wanted to bring our government down, only because they did not want to deal with the distortions that ran through the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to admit that they had been a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">"" "there is worse than during the" "" "Great Depression." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "none of the troika's creditors, who imposed this policy on us, said:" "" "this was a colossal mistake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of talks, you seem to be quite pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="1030">"" "" "" "my biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive." ""</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if they do not survive, the exposed centrifugal forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not have catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we allow ourselves to take the path of a post-modern 1930, according to which it appears to me, it will be equally detrimental to the future of Europeans and non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you for being at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Most of the time Roy Price has never heard, even though he is probably responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision that Roy hit three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slim, has a hedgehog and describes on Twitter as" "" "movies, TV, technique, tacos" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for searching the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard-fought branch.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV series that Roy can't choose any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are on the right side of this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating is from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows received this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is scored with nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that make addicts where, after you have watched a season, your brain asks: "where are there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"" "on the left, here at this end, shows like" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "" "-- -- that should tell you enough what's going on at this end of the curve." ""</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to forbid "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the medium size, the average television -- the shows, which are neither good nor bad, they simply do not impress.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he's really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it is also the first time Amazon is doing something like that, that's why Roy Price does not want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he is holding a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where they can watch them for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon is out for nothing, do you access, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know they will be watched while watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You record when you start the show when you pause, which parts you skip or look again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce with these data.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they collect the data, process it and this results in the answer, and this reads:" "" "Amazon should make a sitcom over four Republican US senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "Alpha House" "", "but it seems that not many people can remember this show because it wasn't that good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">Approximately at the same time with another company another manager placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking for this to find a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a bit different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of organizing a contest, he and his team watched the existing data on the Netflix audience, so the reviews they give the shows, their course, what shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, what producers, what actors?</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the pieces together they went a risk and decided not to make a sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what has happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">It has two very competitive, data-versed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic says somehow that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data for a decision you make, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good television, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work, then this is a bit scary because we live in a time in which we use more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software. come into contact with it, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in prison here in the US and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether or not a discharge occurs.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding if a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are produced. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the most experienced companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that through data analysis, they can predict outbreaks of influenza, the bad way -- through data analysis of Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year around year, until it didn't work any more,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">In spite of all these errors, data abound in decisions of life -- at work, in enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people can unimaginably use many data to make serious decisions, such as the decision for cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, do basically two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, disassemble this problem into its components, so that you can analyze the individual parts; as a second, you put the items together again to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to dismantle a problem and to understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">For this there is another tool and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is to put parts and pieces together again, even if the information is incomplete, then a good decision - especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That's why I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and reason, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have not been able to do. but the decision on how to take all these parts back together and make a show like "House of Cards" is not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show, which meant that they took a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first when they were competing for TV ideas, than selecting "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "this is what the data tell us." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe things are going wrong when data start controlling our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data is just a tool, and in order to not forget this, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it is also called" "" "Magic 8 Ball" "". "it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no-question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer." "" "highly probable" "" "-- right here at this moment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will make it out later with a technical demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I have made some decisions in my life, whereby I should have listened to the ball afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you can of course know, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them with something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball is wiser and wiser and wiser. ultimately it's up to us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays to make decisions, to be an expert in what you are doing and taking risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">For in the end, it is not the data, but the risks that you end up at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks a lot.</seg>
