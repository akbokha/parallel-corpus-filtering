Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your view of the city
an Irish institution , where young people are to meet today .
a cryp@@ t chapel , which is now dig@@ ged for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; farmers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; manage the former ground of farmers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the oldest official map of Munich supports exciting stories for days .
it &apos;s annoying if maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
this is known by everybody who had to get upset because the car Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a stra@@ it road .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria At@@ las@@ es , an offer of ge@@ op@@ ort@@ al Bavaria of the State Government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but it is very informative .
especially when comparing them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a patch carpet that you can &apos;t recognize as such .
in the large picture postcard , more detailed maps , so @-@ called prototype leaves , were incorporated into towns and municipalities .
according to the Bavarian Authority , these were created between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army captain occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria , of course for military purposes .
even though the French troops with@@ drew from the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 , there were today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographical Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bavarian surve@@ ying administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the premiere sheet for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like all others on the website of the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek .
the comparison of early / present is most impressive in the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
S@@ end@@ ling was spent 21 years after drawing up the map , thus in 18@@ 77 , as a Munich subur@@ b .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the rebellion of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first sight : when zo@@ oming appears a small @-@ priced card with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written numbered fl@@ ur@@ ries from the so @-@ called &quot; ur@@ anium , &quot; from which the land tax was derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small plots there are no more farmers there today - but small farmers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land in the sun &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is distinguished north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 the place of the Oktober@@ fest , was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; at the Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; or from the height &quot; On the air &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße , one once locked people with ins@@ anity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich Circle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Circle of Munich &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was created &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den was head of the institution - the psychiat@@ rist , who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and for example ended up dropping the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Irish &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he for@@ bi@@ ds the personnel to use violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients was first place , later it was extended to 500 places .
at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ anstalt in Haar ( 1905 ) .
since 2006 , Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost is one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts .
young people in Munich &apos;s Sal@@ es@@ an@@ um meet on the grounds of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with educational establishments .
west lies the football pitch of the TS@@ V Munich East , east residential buildings from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was erected - in architectural reference to the original construction of the asylum system , which was destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around 18@@ 56 , the Kauf@@ inger street was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
in December 1944 the Al@@ lied bom@@ b@@ ings broke up many holes in the city centre .
a large remained until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a funeral chapel from the Middle Ages were once at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days will be the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn family line takes place .
with the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
civil Rights Group publishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Pro@@ mot@@ ing of Far@@ bers has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which will enter into force by 28 August 2017 , calls af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to take special attention while travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , race @-@ based incidents occur in the entire state and be noted here , &quot; says the group opinion .
a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to win discrimination , as well as the enforcement authorities of the state , dispro@@ portion@@ ately aimed at minorities , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the USA .
the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist crimes against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died in question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more gasoline during the trip and was taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points out a recent report from the Mis@@ sour@@ i General At@@ tor@@ ney General , which shows that black mot@@ ori@@ sts in the state are 75 percent more frequent than wh@@ ites to be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to be ready whether they bring ch@@ ewing money or let the relatives know they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FB@@ I hate crime report , which ranks the state in terms of the number of such violations of the 16th rank of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the States had passed immigration laws that commit local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations , which will contribute to further racial profil@@ ing .
travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but lately interest groups have used the measure as response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
the fence project is elementary
the Fisch@@ bacher Wei@@ dec@@ au@@ n project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U members of the Bundestag Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have provided an image on site .
at the Bau@@ tren@@ en@@ hof of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the Fis@@ her@@ man &apos;s CD@@ U @-@ village association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann initially gave insights into his farm in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 milk cows and as many young animals provided and accommodated in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ milch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative @-@ less mark@@ eter for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Regi@@ on@@ ales come to the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as he is also Chairman of the B@@ L@@ H@@ V @-@ Chairman of Fis@@ her@@ bach , he described the fence project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot profit on such steep faces .
the green area care for a lot of work , much needs to be mach@@ ined with the brus@@ h@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ ser , even if he does not conduct bio @-@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognized the importance of the fence project and is glad about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leader support &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare , farmers would have to be supported .
it is hoped that the re@@ for@@ estation of the surfaces could be pulled out for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the farmers are often critic@@ ised for their support
over the course of the fence , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
the maintenance area is therefore 40 hectares , which must not be for@@ est@@ ered until at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total cost of 71 500 Euro , half was promoted via leader , a quarter carried the municipality of Fischer@@ bach .
thus the farmers stayed 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of electric fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and farmers it doesn &apos;t go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter Weiß stood firm : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best food is produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state administration line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg facilitates the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art promotion of soft sa@@ unas .
the goal is to keep the Black Forest .
the prerequisite is the presence of a conveyor belt designated by the L@@ PR .
moreover , the enclosed area must not be smu@@ gg@@ ler ( slope tendency more than 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the re@@ for@@ estation .
for the Fis@@ her@@ man &apos;s fence project 2018 , the motion of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build close to 16 kilometres of fence , is currently underway .
the disclosure area is 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euro .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp esses the Statue of Liberty
the sur@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans estimate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos place in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tru@@ mp regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the President &apos;s suggestions for dr@@ astic reduction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ators would have liked him if he had done it .
but he assumed its importance , and in particular the importance that it was attributed to , when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poem you refer to is added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is obj@@ ectively correct , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contemporary resonance of the stir@@ ring words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , and your oppressed masses , who y@@ earn to breathe freely , / the mis@@ erable waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mis@@ erable waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better seen on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller did not commit himself to literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Tru@@ mp@@ s USA are not welcome .
this conflict over the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural struggle : it is indeed a conflict about America &apos;s importance .
Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they performed a highly political act .
the sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ anism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical image .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , the people of the right wing wanted to change this for a long time .
the big scre@@ am R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone , but rather an early neo @-@ conserv@@ atives that bring the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty continues .
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch should not enligh@@ ten the way into the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh encountered here .
the significance of the statue is entirely and at all a matter of standpoint of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative action of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , el@@ eventh , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible voy@@ ages on the de@@ cks of ships .
in the tru@@ est sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they must hear .
and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tru@@ mp ever want to acknowledge .
their torch shall not ligh@@ ten the way , but ign@@ ite the hatred that is their only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the team of Great Britain
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the United Kingdom team
&quot; &quot; &quot; the power director of the UK &apos;s athle@@ tics team , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ strong Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship header &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes were selected for London 2017 , starting on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Scotland something special &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the UK have to learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I speak with people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m circuit , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected team captain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally brought in were great . &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver Med@@ al winner , who will compete with the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les at their fifth world champion@@ ships , says that it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mid@@ range runner Mu@@ ir leads this way and last year has set five British and two European records . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will take part in the 1.500 m and the 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ s@@ man , which one should observe after a great season that included the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle recalls her first World Championships as the only other Scot@@ s@@ man in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the team captain says that they are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hu@@ gely proud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the fact that many of their coun@@ try@@ men are not only part of the team , but in some cases also med@@ als and fin@@ als will be mixed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour anyway , but to know that my team@@ mates voted for me and chose me , it makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb to po@@ di@@ ums .
as for my speech as captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a World Championship .
so it &apos;s really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympiastadion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
block critics from Facebook : don &apos;t gru@@ m@@ ble about a public office if you can &apos;t tolerate the in@@ stig@@ ation of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers struck him because of everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he kno@@ cked on the cri@@ tique , sure .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an , who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gan employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ple@@ dged to complain about it at the beginning of this week .
the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is aston@@ ish@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary head of heat .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his elec@@ tors and de@@ file his hair @-@ free head to chemotherapy on his side .
therefore the blocking of people who come to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum that is officially designated and by employees paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans spokesperson , A@@ mel@@ ia Ch@@ asse , defended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the picture of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p .
the post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are just real people speaking with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , not a troll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and non @-@ professional .
the pastor rec@@ ited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to the Catholic faith .
attorney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not filled , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am pol@@ ite that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary area of the news programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea , if a number of people take a position on the same subject , they are dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what employees of the governor referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or del@@ eting a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in former times when we had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical edi@@ t@@ orials or to arrest demonstr@@ ators and to silence them .
but that &apos;s exactly what happens digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official to critici@@ ze Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is accused of Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Jud@@ ge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she ban@@ ished a vot@@ er from her fac@@ ebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit to the AC@@ L@@ U for his use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of the affordable Por@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers varied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous correspon@@ dents beat on his leadership .
and even then , Washington had an anonymous troll@@ s .
the people who used pseud@@ ony@@ ms such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions .
peti@@ tions critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping with Great Britain , overwhel@@ med his ministry , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of George Washington Project .
but he did not put them into silence .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation .
and true guidance means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
the former Europeans Nr. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comfort in the next three days since the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an organized the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year led to the final round in the Arch@@ er@@ field , before losing against Paul E@@ ales , is connected with the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; I &apos;ve seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; Raff@@ er@@ ty said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from his best side , he &apos;s in a great state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job as he established this place .
he is a keen advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engli@@ sh@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , even though he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win here last year .
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year , returns to the action on home floor .
this event will be its first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a bit more when you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am happy about how it has gone so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer through passive smoking
in the past two decades , fewer people have died because of passive smoking of lung cancer .
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer deaths are attributed to passive smoking per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said director Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject in 1994 .
at that time there have been 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking a year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
hous@@ ings prove to be very complex
&quot; &quot; &quot; the construction works in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vill@@ inger Street &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are in full swing and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lie to some extent in time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fred Hein@@ ze &apos;s director . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the area of the house @-@ connections , the situation is more complicated than susp@@ ects , since there is a lot of mountains in the underground , which is not mentioned in the plans .
traffic , which continually obstruc@@ ts construction work , is a major problem for the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of mot@@ ori@@ sts in front of red lights and shut@@ ters is already enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are eligible for transit .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were already quite exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but luckily we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i cook dinner , she does not use a stove .
it even uses only rarely a pot .
in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai rule in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally referred to as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace .
after half an hour the char@@ coal tu@@ ber is extracted and swal@@ lowed up with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay soil - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , for example washing clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , no fields were assigned to her .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , too late to work can be dangerous : most of the village men are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; no one dar@@ es to run around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote against the occup@@ ying troops .
an existing movement that stir@@ red up independence against the Dutch domination quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers .
in 2003 , the province was officially split in Papua and West Papua where the independent part of Papua New Guinea included the eastern part of the island .
the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 hour drive by car .
there is no public transport .
the town with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is made up of wooden houses , which are surrounded by bam@@ boo f@@ ences , and made of corrugated iron roofs that were converted into different yellow @-@ brown tones by rust .
very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans honored a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her vibrant , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright coat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst inf@@ ant mort@@ ality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port was min@@ ed in the value of 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper .
in addition , Papua of wood resources in the value of estimated 78 billion US dollars .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for Papua , which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military has preserved a sti@@ fl@@ ing presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 to almost $ 20 million , including up to 15@@ 0,000 US dollars to a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ anian demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activists more than 500@@ ,000 have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tor@@ tured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969 .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal land in the 1970 &quot; s became genocide in accordance with the Asia Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested over 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we promote everything &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is said in a report by the arch@@ dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as un@@ lawful kill@@ ings and torture - rape and electric shocks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week incidents happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bolts have strengthened since Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic change is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the most popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ting cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served .
local people fight to keep up with it .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chi@@ ckens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai native who moved to work in the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has cost the native Papua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Papua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and violations in Papua in 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but there is little change in Papua , and today the locals feel che@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after the inauguration in October in October .
on December 7 , 2014 was a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers grab@@ bed their tone and later returned with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and struck the group with their ri@@ fl@@ es , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
a child of 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o was so severely beaten that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered on a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice .
they wore cerem@@ onial hunting bows and carried the orph@@ an@@ age @-@ dance - in a circle running constantly and a bird singing - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some prot@@ esters began to cast stones on police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not released by local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto neighborhood of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the im@@ pending danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home .
no one was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I suddenly got shot into my left wrist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his colorful painted wooden house .
Kay@@ ame still does not know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cous@@ in , who was a witness to the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who just bears a name like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , the TI@@ ME in dim mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot;
the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua @-@ police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station only because they were attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves if people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokesperson for the Papua Police , Commissioner P@@ ud@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
the news on the kill@@ ings took place only the following day after Jak@@ arta .
three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Security , Wir@@ anto , said in October 2016 that he establishes an extra@@ judicial mechanism for resol@@ ving historic human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the injuries have occurred long ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and early 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we are committed to addressing these violations , but there are processes that must go through &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , everything is legally regulated &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wir@@ anto , whom the UN has accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; demanding more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ ors of bloody independent vote in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Papua were already settled , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with gri@@ m in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear for years .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , I am afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was struck by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; he says .
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police shot vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ai neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning sh@@ uts .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) started shooting at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured here were quickly delivered , such as the TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called upon to ac@@ coun@@ table the officers involved and withdraw the police &apos;s mobile bri@@ g@@ ade from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a disaster for the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the tribal members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua .
many joined the &quot; Free Papua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papua by increasing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ apping of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM guides are from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a tragic , forgotten place &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty boo@@ sts dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as far away .
people here are building everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women to process four or five fields of sweet potato .
they keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian Rup@@ ias ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
in the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native Papua and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the Nab@@ ire airport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the few jobs there are in the region usually go to the better educated and wealthy immigrants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Papua people rarely have capital or the necessary skills to compete with their own companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the board of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation holds the eyes of the world far from Papua .
beyond that , restrictions on the reporting of international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported from Papua in lack of co @-@ ordination with related institutions , although the rare permission was given to them for filming .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ quiet provinces of Papua and West pap@@ ua : visa den@@ ial and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March six Pacific countries called T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate &quot; different and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically been supporting the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r , rejected the accus@@ ations of the Group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of human right @-@ ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , local people broke their silence and urged him to &quot; We want Freedom , &quot; according to a source that participated in the meeting , but wants to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but Papua people say they will probably not vote again for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Board of Directors .
he wants Jok@@ ow@@ i to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from being under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is in poor education and health services .
Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; that he has to pay back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite threats and intim@@ id@@ ations , the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ shot families led a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the body of an victim was buried on a site just across the police and the military station .
they know that perhaps they will never give them justice , but at least they will not forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with lowered head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capturing the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ pers from Dubai for the second time
on Friday , a fire took place in one of the highest residential towers of the world in Dubai , forcing hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 3@@ 37 @-@ metre @-@ high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which one often calls the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and the scre@@ aming of the people .
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; told a resident who called his name as George , Reu@@ ters .
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that fire fighting units at 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) extingu@@ ished the fire and refriger@@ ated the building .
the government said it is working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can re@@ vit@@ alize questions on the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings around the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after the fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage from facing , exterior trim for decoration or insulation came .
in the UK , the police said that the system of plates for insulation and covering at the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through his big Davis Cup cou@@ p at the General Meeting .
at the session in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the suggestion for this sport was to play Davis Cup singles only on two sets of profits , not spar@@ sely supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
although often very long , but also very much appreciated five @-@ set classics , the traditional competition thus remains .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 % of the member countries voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was scar@@ c@@ ely missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member@@ ships did not accept the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical cont@@ ests , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will continue to work on improving the job application .
it was not until the vote , after many in@@ scriptions , that the proposal had come to fill the final in a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only comparatively small details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host right in the next round in the next round .
in order to reduce the costs of the Organ@@ izer , the requirements regarding training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to perform fewer official media dates ahead of the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring prohibited items into the aircraft , find a survey
an aviation survey revealed that more than 20 percent were smu@@ g@@ gled consciously or un@@ intentionally prohibited items at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , which entered the aircraft while they acci@@ dentally wore forbidden knives or other items with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed they had bel@@ ated that they were mistaken with fire@@ arms , amm@@ unition , or explo@@ sives .
the survey among more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers are more likely to ignore the rules .
by the respon@@ dents who admitted that they know@@ ingly attempted to fly with something forbidden by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent of mill@@ enni@@ als were compared with less than 15 percent , the members of Generation X were .
the most common items passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent reported to have publicly supported subjects with clin@@ ches by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male sur@@ vey@@ ed confirmed that they had deliberately brought illegal drugs into the aircraft .
the company said it inter@@ viewed travelers throughout the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally brought smu@@ g@@ gling goods through airport security and how many have deliberately done it .
it is no surprise that people who are most likely to wear smu@@ g@@ gling goods - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - wear safety , those who fly most often .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure which liquids they can take with or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids conf@@ isc@@ ated by the T@@ SA are liquids that are conf@@ isc@@ ated by the T@@ SA .
for a while the people thought T@@ SA could look at books as smu@@ g@@ gling goods .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .

in doing so , he has so far been suggest@@ ing that some of the clients have already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the constantly trium@@ phant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k has for the first time betra@@ yed a different , less brilliant figure : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k frequently had more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery is just starting .
now Mus@@ k is dre@@ aming : of the 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 6@@ 3.000 have already been withdrawn .
critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is only a non @-@ binding reservation .
in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 USD and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds ) &quot; Reserv@@ ations Payment &quot; completely .
currently 45@@ 5,000 such non @-@ binding reservations are available , spati@@ alized mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la Group does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders could be a problem .
his argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not at demand , but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
2018 - all models should be assembled - 500@@ ,000 , one million by 2020 .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , 1,@@ 800 bookings are made per day .
who orders a &quot; Model 3 , &quot; may expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand new production lines , never tested in practice , without any major disrup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
if it comes to greater delays , then the uncertainty of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ cont@@ ented customers from running in dro@@ ves .
EPA boss P@@ ru@@ itt withdraw@@ s due to the reluc@@ t@@ ance of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
one day after being accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environmental Protection Agency , res@@ ig@@ ned his previous decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce the emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing pollut@@ ants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of government environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint lod@@ ged against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about a deadline exp@@ iring on October 1 for states to comply with the 2015 standards for o@@ zone depl@@ eted o@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay compliance with one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid interfer@@ ing with local decisions or hin@@ dering economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who before his appointment by President Donald Tru@@ mp , was prosec@@ utor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , has long been a reliable opponent of strict environmental protection regulations .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly gone over to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels have opposed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal fall@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ hr regulatory roll@@ back agenda . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month , a Federal Appe@@ als Court in Washington has decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ ages .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that his revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards simply increased the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the States by the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA often did not meet deadlines for execution and then waited to be indic@@ ted by activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement set the date for execution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who compl@@ ained more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings and we take deadlines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and the authority that gives it to us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the statement of the EPA said that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; power to delay and all other legally available &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the rules &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on sound policies and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive re @-@ fr@@ aming of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month shall delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the measure has not yet been set up in the Senate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the New York At@@ tor@@ ney General , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of the states who had lam@@ ented the EPA this week , said that the Group intends to maintain the legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g who flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this case , New York joined California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , O@@ reg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ia , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone arises when pollut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight .
the emerging smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year contribute to thousands of premature deaths .
representatives of public health care and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered over P@@ ru@@ dence &apos;s surprising change of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air that we inhal@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i An@@ n Bur@@ d of Center for Bi@@ ological Divers@@ ity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tru@@ mp government to address environmental pollution and its special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tum@@ ours celebrates 750 years St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 years St. Hil@@ arius church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday 16 July at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant is a popular place to stay .
the visitors of the Six@@ th Bene@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chanted by this powerful place .
the rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village have made friends and promot@@ ers of tum@@ ours to their concern .
Walter Mart@@ ini stresses : &quot; it is a unique village treasure . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us Chapel was first mentioned in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischen Ur@@ zu@@ buch : Ear@@ l Hermann von Sul@@ z &quot; sold the mountain with the parish church on Tum@@ lingen and the Vog@@ tland &quot; to Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the word of the deed , there was also a beautiful courtyard , which belonged to the church or patron , and not the other way round .
so there were also people there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ amt Freuden@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , it was next to the village and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the picture of tum@@ ors , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the magnificent settlement nucle@@ us of the village .
old maps of the period around the year 1600 are under@@ pinn@@ ed by these historical circumstances .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval self @-@ Kyr@@ gy@@ z law .
a gent@@ leman who built a church , consecrated and occupied with a priest , continued to remain the owner of this church and could also inherit this church .
this was the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop .
there were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the greater of the two sh@@ attered at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell rang out for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over later in the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were ham@@ mer@@ ed and the bel@@ fry were stolen .
the roof was le@@ aking .
in 17@@ 96 French troops camped near the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and the church mill , and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demoli@@ shed .
only the church tower was left .
in the New Year &apos;s Eve in 18@@ 34 , a storm split the church tower and half rus@@ hed .
in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demoli@@ shed .
only the tower still existing today remained a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em are cultiv@@ ating the Hil@@ arius plant by the &quot; Schaff@@ hausen Rent@@ als &quot; as successor of Dieter Dock@@ horn .
as organizers , the friends and promot@@ ers invite tum@@ ours on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth seren@@ ade on the old cemetery to the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us Chapel .
it is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freuden@@ stadt and with contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
subur@@ b Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann is talking about the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is starting at 3 : 30 p.m .
to the end of the seren@@ ade , a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organizers will make the fantastic view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organizers are hoping for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is important for tum@@ ors and horns .
the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ ba@@ gen feel particularly committed to home care , such as the Ser@@ en@@ ade organizer Walter Mart@@ ini .
association wants to check the approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim und@@ eth himself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see any legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has asked Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take back his authorisation for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is un@@ lawful .
the association ar@@ gues that no wind turbines could have been approved at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette , as at the time in Vier@@ sen there was only a wind force concentration camp at the boundary to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal .
within this concentration zone construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such zones are intended to prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spar@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few days ago , the city of Vier@@ sen had decided to change the land use plan a second wind force zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette - but this had not been approved by the district government of Düsseldorf , because of a shortage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the approval certificate granted is still un@@ lawful and therefore also to be taken back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break the city council has again decided to enter the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette ; approval by the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is where the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded from planning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the invitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letters have been entered in the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle makes it an occasion to examine the matter again .
but they probably do not mean that the procedure is stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself in terms of the reasoning of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , a new subsidiary of the NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette , the construction of four 200 @-@ metre @-@ high wind turbines .
last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen is indirectly involved , has closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , electricity needs of around 11 400 households can be covered - this corresponds to roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ class households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sen &apos;s city council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind park near Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind power plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor crashing : woman dies at a terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was mort@@ ally wounded .
two more people were easily injured .
the state road remained closed for hours .
following police information a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch , with her car as a companion , drove the L 3@@ 33 towards Bo@@ gel with her 53 year old mother as a companion .
city and dealer plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ aer and people from the region are to discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .
the commercial association and the city administration intend to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to l@@ ure the inhabitants to the shopping spre@@ e in the city centre .
as the Chairman of the Business Association , Christian König , announced that the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend will sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers to what offers their own city provides apart from the usual supermarket goods .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
in addition , local companies are to present themselves with their apprenticeship places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre are intended for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action does not only aim at inhabitants of the city and the near@@ er region .
in preparation , commerci@@ als are on the radio , an internet video and printed bags pointing to the action weekend , says Christian König .
the municipal administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
this means that the commercial association and the city go into another stage of the &quot; Attrac@@ tive City Center &quot; project .
this includes new offers such as the first &quot; active day &quot; to the well @-@ held , well @-@ selling Sunday , talks with all traders and hosts to actively participate .
also attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potentials should be re @-@ opened or re @-@ opened .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals had lost the city centre when shopping .
in the end everyone would have to contribute to en@@ li@@ ven the city centre - to land@@ lords , the companies of the whole city and associations .
it was necessary to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which had spread in part , had said king in the spring .
Birgit St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that the third &quot; home shopping &quot; day , for the first time , will take part in five Thür@@ inger cities .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote the appreciation of local trade and increase its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the action under the leadership of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that each citizen can have a direct influence on their purchasing behaviour . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Tru@@ mp started after tra@@ cked tran@@ scripts of telephone calls Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
telephone calls between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and the leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tru@@ mp served in a telephone call with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
the US president compl@@ ained him because he publicly den@@ ounced the Wall . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
Tru@@ mp started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project .
tran@@ scripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tru@@ mp said Mr. Turn@@ bull said that a trade for the United States of refugees that emig@@ rated to Australia was &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade , which was im@@ par@@ ted by the Obama administration , would look like a &quot; dump &quot; after suggest@@ ing a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the US .
Mr. Tru@@ mp ended the call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; that is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford massacre : activists lead rac@@ ist ly@@ n@@ ching act as a call for justice again
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ obs - a middle @-@ aged man in a needle @-@ strip @-@ suit - took a long train on his cig@@ ar and looked through the wind@@ shield .
inside the occup@@ ants ho@@ ver@@ ed in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ am broke the silence when a young black man was drag@@ ged by the passenger seat .
fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 , is just a copy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost all si@@ ghs in the audience met very real si@@ ghs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 civil rights activists go back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - have been retri@@ eved from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever accused of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really in@@ comprehensible that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see it in our congregations , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in the organization of the night . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt stain on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ s@@ man of Georgia and a life @-@ long civil rights activ@@ ist .
it serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual remembrance of Mon@@ roe &apos;s community that injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to prosec@@ ute , we want the end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must receive justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a place of jurisdiction lay a sheet on the bodies of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
according to FB@@ I files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ making process .
but no one was ever indic@@ ted .
although the susp@@ ects remain free for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always well @-@ known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice allowed the black citizens of Georgia to vote their vote for the first time in the summer election campaign .
about the same time as the election , according to the FB@@ I , the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com played a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our in the city was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore didn &apos;t come from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid $ 600 to free Mal@@ com from prison , such as the FB@@ I .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when they moved from the prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who has prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes an FB@@ I report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removed evidence and has concealed the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks makes it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an election law massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , then this will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual re @-@ production of Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is illustr@@ ative , po@@ ign@@ ant and is rooted in a kind of deep racism , of which many want to believe that he does not exist in America any more .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the ly@@ n@@ ching because we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I &apos;ve been going through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - crowded into a room and listened when Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director .
he has played the role of the leader clan member for years , but he said the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room , the actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ hid , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , tested their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester cri@@ es and pus@@ hes him , fur@@ ious that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n -- he disappeared from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ras@@ cona &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rep@@ lies the fire . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what ? ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ras@@ cona . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still gi@@ g@@ gling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think white people at that time &apos; n -- he &apos; said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black performers thunder@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ ion@@ ship replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy making this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts once more .
this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharply and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
a woman , dressed with a dress dress , stands above the cor@@ p@@ se of the actors and seduc@@ es Bil@@ lie &apos;s pra@@ ises &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
your voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it , there is a group of about four dozen spectators sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost uni@@ form@@ ly divided between black and white .
a couple came from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many just come down the street .
they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as op@@ pres@@ sive humidity for nearly eight hours when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ res of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
until this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one stands on the same country , where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y .
when the final notes of the song sound out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the bodies .
children ho@@ cks in their heads , register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per one another .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mur@@ m@@ urs a little boy as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene would like to thank the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch@@ rope and wipe away their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w embra@@ ces Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ li embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their arms , the emotional load of the performance eventually breaks through him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that it is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have done this for one reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience sat together with the actors for dinner .
at one table a white pair of Atlanta talks about the after@@ market with a black couple that they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky strug@@ gled to find words which had left the performance .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and do what they do because they look like you , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ches are still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called the police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone &apos;s yard holds Broo@@ ks &apos;s farm at his table , eating and remember@@ ing the civil rights .
he said he had already begun to plan the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reproduction is inspiring in a way , because it describes the horror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so if we do not learn from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf relies on a colorful fri@@ vol@@ ous staging in front of a giant , six @-@ story backdrop .
the stage ( designed by Alek@@ sand@@ ar Den@@ ic ) shows either a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner including wall rest and ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and E@@ la@@ ste &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes classic car par@@ ked in which the Rhein@@ ills pose as rock erg@@ ir@@ ls , alternatively an is@@ etta .
st@@ acked barrels of oil remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs leit@@ mo@@ tiv - money , power and gre@@ ed - which runs through its &quot; ring &quot; production .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize as already in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
k@@ ess seduc@@ es Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , in Hollywood @-@ style a cor@@ p@@ se in the trunk and enter the Kra@@ wal@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen Mill@@ ing sings the gorgeous nasty Hagen that surrounds the aura of a heav@@ y@@ weight box@@ er .
brutal the scene when he s@@ miles Siegfried .
later also Gun@@ ther ( Markus Strip ) must believe in it .
the audience thanks it to the ensemble with strong appl@@ ause .
Fo@@ ster , Mill@@ ing , Vin@@ ke and Con@@ duc@@ tor Jan@@ owski are celebrated stor@@ m@@ ically , who hum@@ bles himself and for@@ wards the hands to the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te .
there is great appl@@ ause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in casual leisure wear .
the appearance was eag@@ erly awa@@ ited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , when he had to leave the whist@@ le concert in 2013 , there were five years later , great che@@ ers , in which the isolated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bu@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls went down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to be happy about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you notice that the audience with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has grown together in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience did not only make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of his views .
I prefer a positive resume .
Max quantity works as a volunteer
they work in several places in their voluntary year .
where everywhere ?
quantity : usually in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture market , once a week I help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I also worked at school in the open full day .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it is a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ time volunteer .
how does that come from ?
quantity : I took Ab@@ itur .
and then a civil engineering degree , let &apos;s say , successfully broken off .
I realized that it is the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else with people working .
and then I asked what you do .
do a social year , as there is an insight , there you can see how it is on the spot , in the focal point maybe , really .
and was it like that ?
amount : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social sector in the winter semester .
I will study dual , probably do a social worker training in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study at the university of applied sciences in Ham@@ m .
isn &apos;t it a bit unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it probably depends on where you are doing his FS@@ J .
it is possible to do it from the old people to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
it was very interesting for me .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon supervision .
for me that was exactly the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works out .
unlike in civil engineering studies ?
quantity : well clear , here it is not about calculating St@@ ati@@ ken .
there are always other people in front of us , each having a completely different story behind them .
whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , has been fet@@ ched out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually .
very interesting .
and you did not have any reservations ?
amount : I &apos;m not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
great love , great kindness .
there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s how life is .
Pear@@ son pl@@ ung@@ es more than 3,000 jobs and cuts divi@@ den@@ ds to revi@@ ve the business
the British educational group Pear@@ son said on Friday , she will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure that the company is facing .
the reduction in staff@@ ing , the general director John Fall@@ on mainly announced for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , in which 4,000 jobs have already been lost .
in May , Pear@@ son announced plans to cost a further 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in a third cost reduction programme to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the rapid pace of digital learning .
the company , which had sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann in the past month , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged , after an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kab@@ ul con@@ vo@@ y attack : NATO soldier killed in suicide attacks
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ vo@@ y in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed NATO and injured several others , state officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter were viol@@ ated , shared a NATO Declaration .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died in the incident in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district .
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of Nato it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening was done when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explo@@ sives &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all the injured are in a stable state and treated in the US military hospital on the Bag@@ ram air@@ field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian death victims in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , of which 20 % were in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they had done this attack .
on May 31 , a tremendous bombar@@ d@@ ment in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the most deadly milit@@ ant attack in the country since the US @-@ led troops forced the Taliban out of power in 2001 .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious safety situation in Afghanistan as U.S. president Donald Tru@@ mp is considering raising the number of U.S. troops that support the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that in recent weeks the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policies and especially in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f Gh@@ ani .
EPA returns decision to delay the smo@@ g rule after col@@ lagen
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , repe@@ al that the states are obliged to cur@@ b the Smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was a day after 15 states accused the agency for the stri@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ zone provisions 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said that they show the commitment of the agency to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in the dialogue with and because we respond to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA Chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced in June the intention of EPA to determine the o@@ zone provisions - in which pollut@@ ant emissions must be measured in a part of the country in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to return a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda , which according to Tru@@ mp should boost economic growth .
however , efforts have triggered the set@@ back of democr@@ ats and nature conservation groups , wor@@ rying about the impact of larger emissions on public health .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA &apos;s website says that inhal@@ ing air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduce lung function and strengthen respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
community wants communal space
at the end , the decision was clear : in two opposing voices , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn Win@@ es decides to set up a common room in the future retirement home .
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the remaining part of the land was signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ ades .
while the area is still part of the community , it will still take a while until the church community has so far been part of the community , but now there is no planning obstacle for the project being st@@ em@@ ming from a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common room .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the municipal council pret@@ end to not fores@@ ee such a common space as a meeting point only for the inhabitants of sen@@ i@@ or@@ ean living , but openly in the congregation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision , which was decided by the provision of funds for the ongoing budget already last autumn , will be determined by funding opportunities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the construction is located in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area .
the establishment of a common room would be , thus reported T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent promoted .
the proposal is to signal the investor that in this respect it is not possible to throw a stick between the legs , the finding that both saddle - which is based on the surrounding building - as well as pitch roof - which reduces the height and makes the construction more economical - would be possible .
need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer thinks this addition .
when it helps : unanim@@ ously it happens to the body .
it is not as simple as the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s call points to the many own buildings with which one does not go so well , but now they rest in the common room out of the window , she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very hard with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger really speaks for the community room - but absolutely against a communal participation .
it sees behind it a hidden subsi@@ dy to already wealthy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the surface one does not give a subsi@@ dy , but rather receive a real , in case of doubt a market@@ able counterpart , is the counter @-@ speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sta@@ wi@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; request to meet the proposal is three pro@@ pon@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two opposing voices in the original program that Stefan H@@ aller summari@@ zes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we take the decision , we make a huge step in closing a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
colli@@ sions with car : cyclists are thrown onto the road
at the crossing of the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycli@@ st was captured by a car in Gar@@ eth on Wednesday and severely injured .
as the police hur@@ ried , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the way out of direction Hil@@ den by 12.@@ 8 pm with his bike on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg .
the Senior wanted to cross the road at the bush of the Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driving in the same direction granted him priority .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the road , he obviously did not notice the on@@ coming traffic .
he joined a car that had a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a retro train .
FC Bayern Munich must abst@@ ain from the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba must su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
with personnel worries the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory clearance of the new season .
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , the personnel will always be bigger at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must also use the BV@@ B on David Al@@ aba in conjunction with the BV@@ B .
the Italian confirmed this on Friday .
in addition , the Munich students are missing Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six tests , An@@ cel@@ otti bl@@ amed the physical condition and the lack of balance in his team &apos;s play .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this was last not good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in a performance increase in the first official mandatory game of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights captiv@@ ates the fans .
the game is sold with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , distributed the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday .
hike in the resin from star to star
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the resin , the nationwide first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is planned by the Verein Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accommo@@ dates the information needs of many visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Acces@@ sible Install@@ ations to five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question comes from St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the boards should be supplemented by Internet .
therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of location .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later , the path to the star path is to be expanded by train .
&quot; on the star@@ ry trail , the viewer experience a lot of interesting facts , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; the association explained .
in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star more light than another even though it was far away .
also , in which con@@ stellation you can find a selected star and when it is best to see .
since 2014 the association operates in the mountain village of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg the highest situated observ@@ atory in Northern Germany .
according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the site in the Harz National Park ranks among the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
frequently from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y with naked eye can be seen clearly .
in the university city since 2003 on the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Göttingen , there is something similar to the planned star@@ base - the planet path .
starting from Geb@@ har@@ den &apos;s hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet leads up to H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ a@@ es with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to d@@ warf planet that is dem@@ oted to the d@@ warf planet - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the exact 75 metre distant Sun measures 70 centimet@@ ers .
the entire distance from the planet is about four kilometers .
while the light from sun to Plu@@ to needs about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
so pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next star would still last half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who should stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Box@@ ing Council Light@@ weight champion , went down the corridor to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Box@@ ing organization Super @-@ Feder@@ weight champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ division world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday to Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it you , Champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you a lot of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noticed that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former spring weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I climbed up for bronze &#91; to 140 l@@ bs@@ . &#93; , but I am not so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I &apos;d like to come down on light weight .
and he must move on light weight &#91; 135 Po@@ unds &#93; and then we fight .
that &apos;s what the fans demand .
let &apos;s give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kli@@ mas asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year to arrange a date with Gar@@ cia next summer ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their lightweight title fight in the Forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in the pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans asked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia and later expressed openly to fight with the network that offers the best finance package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can produce this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said he would appreciate Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he may participate in his Saturday battle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held a lot of praise for Gar@@ cia and said he was thinking the champion from River@@ side looks very slow , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the K@@ o @-@ off . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show impact , then boxing .
both said they could feel the momentum that was built up for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Lom@@ ach@@ enko : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that is Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four Ver@@ sions to the Tire Race
in an accident at the A@@ 7 , four people were seriously injured in the afternoon .
following initial information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost control of his vehicle at 16.@@ 30 shortly before the connection point of the market .
the passenger hur@@ ried to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ came and then remained on the roof in the green stri@@ pe .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .
during the last supply of the injured by the ambul@@ ance service , the A@@ 7 was blocked in the direction of the North for about an hour , then the traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; tri@@ parti@@ te works better &quot;
and@@ re Hoffmann hopes after the 2 : 2 to the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig that the optimization of the defensive formation in Au@@ e points brings .
with the first round of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , because not the two opponents had been at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to watch better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ enders of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the tri@@ mming should also be further optimized .
and the For@@ tun@@ ics don &apos;t want to capture a fool according to a violation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be that no one stands next to Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be better able to cope with the tri@@ parti@@ te , than with the four @-@ leg@@ ged chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t know yet how we will operate in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we are in the triple chain on half positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann , who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a prerequisite is , however , that we are still better harmon@@ izing and we don &apos;t have so many playing mistakes in construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann also goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can talk about a failed start after a draw , you don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance might well be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we stand at four points on Sunday and concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a regular season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer wanted to know nothing about that .
&quot; I judged the start of the season only after six to eight play@@ days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled pre@@ mat@@ urely because of a storm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann that the Au@@ e players might even be a bit fres@@ her because they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a career favorite in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know 100 percent where they currently stand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the inner def@@ enders of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the guests from the Rhin@@ eland as a light favorite on Sunday come to the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we swe@@ ep them away only because we are entitled to come under the first six is non@@ sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e out of nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga which you have to beat from the start , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says For@@ tun@@ as Chief Coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; making such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so Funk@@ el wants to see his players in no case on Sunday .
new results of Swedish asylum @-@ old evaluation tests published
recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which have been subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the people tested are older than 18 years , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for for@@ en@@ sic medicine ( Rä@@ t@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started the tests last year .
during the asylum procedure , they should take a closer look at the assessment of the age after the Swedish Migration Commission has been critici@@ zed for errors in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees who were minor .
to date , migration of 6,@@ 8@@ 80 has been sent to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31st July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older , whereas in other 25 cases For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of recent months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the journal The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied over his age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 results , she noted that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , in which X @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images are made of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , was also critici@@ zed in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the En@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute whose work involves the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see if they were usually going through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
assessing biological age in this way is very uns@@ af@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot safely say it , we shouldn &apos;t do that as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson from For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency advoc@@ ated the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of a child as an adult is in@@ correctly assessed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest risk is if the person is under 18 , in that case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in the plan
the works on the three bridges of Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday a seven tons of heavy concrete part on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach was installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it is running well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , head of construction in the department of road construction and traffic at the government Pres@@ idency of Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the work began at the same time on all three need @-@ building bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building end is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the timet@@ able is comp@@ lied with .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a concrete arch bridge made of concrete , covered with red sand@@ stone and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has now come to the years .
to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabil@@ itated .
the two other bridges lead over Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red sand@@ stone .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach is now on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called brid@@ ging cap .
this is a ver@@ ge attachment that is also used as an operating path .
a 2.@@ 20 metre wide bridge cap is to be used on the southern part of the bridge on Friday .
then the pedestrian path is to run .
the special interest is that it is fabricated parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berg company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented bridges .
a special feeling of t@@ act has required laying cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable that many companies are connected to .
local residents were informed about the project prior to the work .
furthermore fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished first .
for bridges between the building yard and the Flat@@ tra@@ her in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is controlled by a traffic light lane .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher village entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is fully closed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the three bridge structures amount to 700 000 Euro .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : under protest with German potato salad
it is not so common that parties pull in a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) comes together , which is otherwise difficult to bring under a hat .
the parties represented in the C@@ ret@@ an Vol@@ can@@ ese ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows a peaceful flag this day because the Af@@ D invites in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle R@@ ond@@ ell to the loud poster &quot; great election campaign . &quot;
and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , which together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on the spot already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ eag@@ les , but demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eifel remains colorful &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally the town @-@ picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the fountain area , but now takes place in the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle .
a colorful picture that offers .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair@@ person of the Forum One World and one of the authorit@@ ative organizers , was really happy : &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are music and lots of food , among them an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ancient potato salad , which also the Af@@ D could eat without any problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence especially at the railway station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reported by the Af@@ D volcano Eifel , he tried to make such an event and got the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf was first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us church there were not enough parking spaces available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also does it : at about 20 o &apos;clock on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ forec@@ our@@ t there is a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle various speakers , including the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D chairman Uwe Junge .
there are about 200 listeners in the hall waiting for the top candidate for the election of the Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch to talk about her speeches .
the police presence is unchanged , but until now the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour the Af@@ D event , the guests in the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there it is short after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police cannot move - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
there is a return with the Wolf@@ acher tro@@ mb@@ one Freder@@ ic B@@ elli in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ konz@@ erte tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the monastery church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov he gives a concert under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meets classical German education with roots in brass music . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the solo@@ ist of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both united the desire to not only to transc@@ end boundaries on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .
this is how Johann Sebastian Bach sounds in a new garment , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; world music , &quot; united with Bulgarian folklore , and in the &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz musician N@@ ils W@@ ogram , mixes classic , jazz and free play to a fascinating synthesis of the Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk .
this key piece of the program was premi@@ ered this spring with a huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it especially for the two musicians and more yet : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acoustics is consciously incorporated into the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart speaks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart is openly talking about her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s coming next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who finally tackl@@ ed bitter@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the brunette Dar@@ stell@@ erin is insured against the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was seriously in love with every one I had done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or do you think I would have played it ? &quot;
after her separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed du@@ alism .
so I have never confused or hin@@ der myself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have never really liked to be taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she suffered particularly in the school time when she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this really hurt me very much .
when I was eleven I told me the children , I would look like a boy .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Girl , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the public do not like to explain their love life : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people expect you to behave in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself before the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces he changes the party
the Democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a demonstration with President Tru@@ mp that he will change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you a lot of prayers and lots of re@@ thinking ... Today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I &apos;m a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; as a trainer I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp previously promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rallye .
Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he has coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , on Thursday evening , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation in which it said : &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party which would rather hin@@ der us from making our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party which is without guidance from top to bottom , and is unable to find a positive , unanim@@ ous message , &quot; said the President Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of C@@ BS News .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia for a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be res@@ um@@ ed into the sport .
Russian athle@@ tics chief D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ lak@@ h@@ ine said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of the World Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were cut off gold and silver med@@ als in competitions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF voted in favour of maintaining the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence on state sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the re@@ porter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has realized in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made , but the congress supports the Task Force recommendations that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to do everything in the next few months to normal@@ ise this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle always was that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete for the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships , which begin on Friday in London according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
the leader of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for a re @-@ setting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug testing is still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still free , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in London after a lecture by the IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mour@@ ning ceremony for soldiers cut off in Mali
during a funeral service in the north @-@ h@@ ess@@ ische F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
for an even un@@ explained crash , Minister Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they described the two opposite pilots as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of their trade &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow down to this highest sacrifice they have produced in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Chief of Staff from Nord@@ h@@ essen had died on Wednesday a week ago in Mali &apos;s West African Republic .
her coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a vi@@ gil of the Bundes@@ wehr into the F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Saint Peter on Thursday .
at noon , only the members of the church took leave .
afterwards , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ eker .
ro@@ ses laid down ro@@ ses , the relatives stood by arm in arm at the coff@@ ins .
in front of the church , F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Defence of the Le@@ yen called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up@@ lifted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sat@@ ra@@ ged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann had built the flight operations of the fighting helicopter Tiger in F@@ rit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger drivers of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regi@@ ment , to whom the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the crew couldn &apos;t turn away the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doubts about the UN mission in Mali found Minister of the Le@@ yen not : deployment is dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country that we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they were buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want a grave beside his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .
that shared the ro@@ yalty on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple will be buried in the Ros@@ kil@@ de cathedral .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the queen was in agreement with her husband &apos;s decision , and she said it further in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 , he retired and also covers the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prince Su@@ pper &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik has not received the title and the function he wanted , he does not see himself as equivalent to his wife - also not after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish royal house .
where the last resting place of the 83 year old will ultimately be , is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he worked for the last 50 years .
the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristoc@@ ratic family , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French embassy .
during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people always flew over , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his almost 50 years of reign with the Dan@@ es .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik wrote about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was fluctu@@ ating , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation to be the brand of socio @-@ critical intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be content with this position and not to be ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants swift re@@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP against possible majority in Lower Saxony
Nieder@@ sach@@ sens &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the country , but he does not want to step back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday for the dissolution of the Parliament &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprising withdrawal of a Green Party from its parliament fraction in Lower Saxony over@@ threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before the official date of the Sunday election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce A @-@ votes majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the current Green Party of El@@ ke T@@ ests founded her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ ü@@ m@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; CD@@ U leader Björn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his group to take it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony State Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far , the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag will be elected regular on the 14th of January next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said that the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether it could go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Stephan Wei@@ l considers it essential that the day of the country as soon as possible resol@@ ves its self @-@ dissolution .
the CD@@ U group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state constitution also sees the possibility that the Parliament &apos;s parliament chooses trust and sel@@ ects a successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our constitution offers several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these options must be properly checked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will discuss all questions in peace if they are judi@@ ci@@ ously tested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ Northwest &apos;s step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something kur@@ i@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian herself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;
she described himself as a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called on the dis@@ sident legis@@ lators to return their state parliament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we , of course , assume that they have returned their country residence , which has received it over the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the pres@@ idents of Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group president , Anja P@@ iel , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ests extraordinary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has deliberately decided not to lead any pron@@ unciation in the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transfer of the Lower Saxony @-@ MEP El@@ ke T@@ ests to the CD@@ U as treas@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the attitude of the former Green Party members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the Social Democrats &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly elect the parliament .
the Australian tak@@ e@@ off costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the political woman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her last vanity and fru@@ stration her personal interests in front of the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised SPD General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony is involved in this dirty intri@@ gue and tries to make political capital from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dutch CD@@ U president Björn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to include El@@ ke T@@ ests in CD@@ U .
the Leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , accused the T@@ ests of fal@@ si@@ fying the results of the 2013 state election with personal career gifts .
the CD@@ U was at that time the strongest power in the SPD , the SPD and the Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of one vote in the parliament .
agriculture Minister in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from gre@@ ets , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany discusses the poll@@ uted eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editorial network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr Schmidt , How can the consumer protect himself from pois@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers to watch the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp screen .
the German federal states provide the latest information on the affected eggs bat@@ ches on the Consumer Protection Portal : www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if according to everything we currently know , a health hazard is practically impossible .
is Al@@ di now taking over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the re@@ conn@@ aissance aircraft is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
despite this , my house has immediately turned up@@ side down and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany &apos;s suffer@@ ings .
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
trade has just as the manufacturers ensure that the sold products are market@@ able and harmless to health .
if the residual rate content of 0.00@@ 5 mg / kg is exceeded in eggs , these are not market@@ able .
un@@ poll@@ uted eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time the farms are not to blame .
are production plants and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
according to the present state of knowledge , the production plants are not responsible for immediate guilt .
rather , due to the presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies , they have to reck@@ on with economic damages .
as always , there are too few controllers in the case of serious diarr@@ ho@@ ea .
is it missing only on the staff or at the conclu@@ sive competence ?
it was just the official controls that have exposed the process .
the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded .
this is precisely why a consistent education of such events and the hand@@ over to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where crimes can exist are of crucial importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made several times clear that I expect a complete education from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the regular alarm at food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the consumers have the right to only get safe and market@@ able food . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an un@@ authorised insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ tra@@ ged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pan@@ de@@ mic means that manufacturers , traders and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
in principle , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ supplying animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately .
this has to be done consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
I expect from all the competent authorities that the facts are quickly and completely elu@@ ci@@ dated .
how the financial rules of football affect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imped@@ ed spending of European football clubs will not bo@@ ther N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will yet come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of UEF@@ A because the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to for@@ bid teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial fair play rules launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A mean that PS@@ G has to prove at some point that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without great losses .
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million $ ) to get the Brazilian out of its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can certainly make the money loose in order for N@@ ey@@ mar to sign and bring him into a galax@@ y of other stars , given the financing of the team by the power @-@ rich ruling family of Qatar .
clubs may spend a lot of money for the purchase of players , but must contribute with legitimate revenue sources that allow them to break even point in their business on football .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous debts in their pursuit of success , effectively che@@ ated and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration on the debt of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the Roman Abr@@ amo@@ vich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter .
in the current three @-@ year development period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses amounting to EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the pres@@ idency in 2015 , his UEF@@ A successor Alek@@ s@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to deter him from excessive spending .
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will definitely intensi@@ fy the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the sales revenue for the next five years can be reported in the amount of EUR 4@@ 4.4 million in the financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit PS@@ G along with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the tough@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the teams of teams for the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 player .
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs trying to out@@ wi@@ t their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a Catalan company could sponsor PS@@ G if the value of sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be considered a legitimate income .
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the P@@ SA sponsorship of the Qatar Tourism Authority has been infl@@ ated .
it was reported that some of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come to Qatar on payments of the Organisation Committee of the 2022 World Cup .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have argued that N@@ ey@@ mar Cup ambass@@ adors will be and such maneu@@ vers could be easy to find for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities .
the sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to observe any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , announc@@ ing Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , as they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated a profit of more than € 10 million with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros .
accounts for the last financial year must still be published .
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and jer@@ sey sales .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signature .
the Spanish league was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players and tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s removal by claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar &apos;s last owner of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
arsen@@ al manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American sports ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state that finances an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial fair@@ play because one can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new software supplier
in recent years chocolate Fre@@ y board chocolate has produced chocolate for the Swiss .
now the sweet co @-@ operation is on the ver@@ ge of a possible end : the airline is re@@ writing the order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Swiss @-@ speaking Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; North West Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to current plans , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some 17 million small white @-@ white packed charts of 14 grams per year distribute the flight atten@@ d@@ ants in front of landing to the passengers .
the Swiss didn &apos;t want to give any information about the costs .
industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders according to &quot; North West Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effect once and for all : it is a prestigious order for a g@@ og@@ gi@@ ver producer .
the Swiss will not want to reveal how many applicants are there for the new tender .
however , only Swiss manufacturers are in question .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the treaty on spring 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss chocolate producer was not available for a comment .
Swiss has been distributing chocolate boards since 2006 on board their flights .
before Swiss made a contract with Mig@@ ros daughter , Bar@@ ry Cal@@ le@@ baut has supplied chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
Swiss took the opportunity to place the logo at two and a half years ago with the start of collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works together with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ haul flights the customers of the First Class with goo@@ dies were spoiled by the conf@@ isc@@ ated Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in the Business Class nas@@ chen passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi von Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi is also distributed by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in Business and Economy Class .

no@@ stal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of history is at the same time no@@ stal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &quot; s , for the 90 @-@ years Gr@@ unge era ( as the pione@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ etch com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to bigger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ ody and an em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise feels like the time was scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; func@@ tioned surprisingly well , not just because of its absurd hum@@ our ( it contained an original story for a talking tin vegetable that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by sti@@ cking to the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play cool children who will grow - nevertheless they managed to regain the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults , who now play adults , is less emo@@ tionally rooted and his par@@ ody leaves more after the watering can principle , including a riff on the stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ ies like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le . &quot;
at one point , a character rum@@ bles through an Apple @-@ Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the ami@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy evil plot in which Ron@@ ald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) is involved , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of fran@@ chise .
it &apos;s a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Rud@@ d , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s under@@ lip of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old cra@@ cker .
it &apos;s the moments of accidental del@@ usion that could heat this fran@@ chise like a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until it reaches that which I think as its logical conclusion : &quot; wet Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the gang of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Amazon now reminds of a different kind of no@@ stal@@ gia : to revi@@ ve the Cold War of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and even to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its east @-@ to @-@ west ring campaign icon@@ ography . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the com@@ edy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka with Rh@@ ys Thomas as a director is to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogues of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an extensive producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt are syn@@ ced in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice days to watch ( the police spend the time watching chess on TV , like Americans might do it with football ) .
and the list of famous speakers - among them J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de the voice out &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ agan mask - that it often plays like a single .
with six long episodes , it moves away and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough .
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; which was edited on a smaller length , could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , as Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef always visit the American embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message for the imagined Communist International is that Western culture can do everything for for@@ age .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger story and with thei@@ rs .
blow against drug ma@@ fia in the country
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have succeeded in beating the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Schwar@@ zwald @-@ Ba@@ ar district , Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office ha@@ st@@ ened on Friday .
15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years old , and arrest warran@@ ts were issued against them .
in addition , the officials included large amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros .
two people were arrested in the case of the same ra@@ ids in Italy .
against the susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two are probably delivered to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the campaign .
a total of more than 300 police officers were in use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ma@@ fia &apos;s members are accused of organised crime of drugs , heavy violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in Kon@@ stanz has been investigating the organised drug traffi@@ cking in the South German region .
between the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Constance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil were in close contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , the Grand Canal was also accompanied by four official officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning .
as a result of the investigations , Italian nation@@ als were mainly related to the Italian ma@@ fia .
also a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired up in a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account .
how large gaps in the foreig@@ ner register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens that should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreig@@ ner register in Germany has considerable short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions in asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the commission@@ er for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , pointed out to a media report to large gaps in the country &apos;s Central Register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to some serious mis@@ decisions in asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warned in an analysis published by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to information , ten million people with foreign nation@@ alities are registered in the register , including 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore managed by approximately 600 immigration authorities in Germany .
because the data has not been adequately cared for , data quality in parts has not been good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data were found in 1921 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of people who are no longer alive , or by citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faulty data entries can slow down reverse processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in statistics of sufficient people , EU citizens are also included , who would not have to travel abroad at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , such false assignments led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a distorted debate on how to deal with sufficient money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the German government apparently started sending refugee families back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they came from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the paper says that the BA@@ MF lead such proceedings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 it was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper has a reference to the difficult situation on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Convention , it is responsible for refugees from the EU state that they first reach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if an immig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the immig@@ rant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a reason , the office is now writing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased significantly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy has given guarantees for the recording and accommodation of family guarantees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even the European Court of Human Rights ( E@@ GM@@ R ) believes these commitments are sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other EU states would also send refugees back there within the framework of the Dublin Convention .
the internal political spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing fraction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten the lack of human rights and a risk of child welfare due to lack of rights in the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood of people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach provided the blood donation service for other people .
at least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
above all Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who has now distributed 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations .
traditionally , in the meeting of the Municipal Council , the congregation acknow@@ le@@ dges the willingness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is awesome how our bodies are created for it , and we pay tribute to the don@@ ors who provide their blood for strangers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ lined mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the county manager of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Ma@@ isen@@ bacher , because the cann@@ ed are broken down into their constitu@@ ents .
for example , three people could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , Ma@@ isen@@ bacher reports about the actions carried out in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach in the spring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K district manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the switch to the theatre house has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago .
before that , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Stra@@ w@@ berry joined the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 contributions each .
half so many contracts Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ oth@@ ee Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter gave ten times each 500 milli@@ litres of their life @-@ juice .
the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is likely to announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ed spec@@ ulation about an increase .
the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; s@@ lugg@@ ish , &quot; as it retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensi@@ fying pressure .
the Bank &apos;s political decision makers ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted in favour of 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members in this month to increase because the weak economic growth weakened the support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and 1.6 % for 2018 , and warned that the pressure on budget@@ ary income would continue , and inflation is expected to rise to just under 3 % in the autumn .
but it sign@@ alized that in the coming years interest rate increases would be needed to cur@@ b the inflation that was heated by Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that credit costs would have to rise more than expected at the financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw a part of the Mamm@@ ut business package , which was issued a year after Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will demand time for the financial plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks as of the coming February , although it has been said that it will now be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central prog@@ nosis of the M@@ PC , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term , as pressure on the real income of households continues to strain consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the rate of interest , it repe@@ ats that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain stream@@ lining of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be required to cool inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slightly larger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scale than the markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank stressed that increases would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
forecasts to 2018 illustrate how the market is set to change .
it retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the Po@@ und dropped after these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the Po@@ und dropped by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 USD and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ed rising expectations on interest increase and GDP increased from 0.2 % in the second quarter to 0.3 % in the previous three months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will be easy to recover after the end of the year .
the latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and minor enh@@ ancements , since the tigh@@ tening is first even worse before it becomes better .
she added that in the next few years , monetary policy cannot &quot; stop &quot; the in@@ comes of income , &quot; but she added that the wages to the end of her three @-@ year prog@@ nosis would be &quot; clear . &quot;
the economy is also boo@@ sted by the rising demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak Po@@ und , which is compensated by a portion of lower consumption expenditure .
the decision is made one year after lowering interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August following the shock@@ ing EU vote , which caused the fall of the pound .
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years to complete the prices and the economy .
prior to the Bank &apos;s last judgment on interest rates , the call for interest rates rose , as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers demanding an increase to 0.5 % in July .
inflation has dropped from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said it was expected to attract attention in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bank said the excess in relation to its target of 2 % was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attributable to the weak Po@@ und . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ br@@ ine , director at Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent down@@ fall of the swa@@ p rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again , as the credi@@ tors seek to search for businesses and end the year in a positive way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market looks particularly well for those in which the existing deals are running out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) shall prescri@@ be 10,000 people controversial HIV drug
&quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment from September following a High Court fight against the funding of the drug in N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ sex pre @-@ posi@@ tional pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now delivered by the health service over a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it .
the ch@@ ess@@ board announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to enable registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
prec@@ ursor pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infection @-@ prone areas .
pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
to those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
clinics are identified to identify suitable participants , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and registered with a GP may also register for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic .
the program will sign £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply medications this week following an international competitive sourcing .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence in a targeted manner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in addressing one of the greatest health challenges facing mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , when target@@ ing people vulnerable and vulnerable , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner which leads to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cor@@ di@@ ally welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now , as the pre@@ p test has been proc@@ ured , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 infected people infected with HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on H@@ od@@ g@@ son , Minister of Foreign Affairs , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delays and hes@@ itation by the government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and stop the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that they will contribute to the closure of the spread of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , declined in 2014 from a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
it is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was looking for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ bedroom estate with a ne@@ sted layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted storage and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimally .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , plenty of light .
that was my request , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed of Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to take advantage of the 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over each other so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating an intermediate floor where you could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the task .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were st@@ acked on top of each other without having to bend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to create the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with an additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper @-@ light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us overlooks the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to let it work longer .
in the kitchen , the reflection feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all cut@@ lery and glasses of jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can shut down the kitchen if it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering went inside , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is opposite so that when you push the door , it is very easy to gli@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and make a calculation based on the size of the soil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that you touch and which help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not fall into the electrical outlets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and increased square met@@ er@@ count of some standard into something completely amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to not leave it .
brothers fight for a 500 million dollar real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty in a dispute because of one of the largest real estate sites of Vict@@ ori@@ as worth more than $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their business capacity should be divided .
Paul wanted to reti@@ re from family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate on separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers bought 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family purchased a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood in 1973 .
the West@@ co family founded jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for $ 85 million in 1999 .
this money has been invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in the city centre , Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt . Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the subur@@ b .
after an agreement with her dec@@ eased father , Col@@ in - by Paul described as &quot; chief operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about a third .
a court deed states that this means that Col@@ in owns property of 3@@ 16 million dollars and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a point of fact for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the resolutions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I held for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first affir@@ m@@ da@@ v@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several failed negotiations .
the Brothers are now fighting for control over the existing business - from which Col@@ in , as Paul claims to have excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but re@@ jects Paul to manage some land@@ ings in@@ competent .
in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it that was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the argument .
&quot; my Italian inheritance writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the costs rise in the event , with hundreds of pages with monkey items , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck C@@ ram@@ er , and with leading lawyers , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and by both parties held law firms .
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her death husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who bought dairy @-@ bars and delic@@ at@@ essen from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the first jeans shop of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in says that he began &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to share their property with their children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of De Lu@@ tis Group , where Col@@ in claims that marks were paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million when leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , so Paul says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bitter about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in was very restra@@ ined , although he was a former AF@@ L member of the AF@@ L and following a biography from the year 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current conflict , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , and added that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our affair will be resolved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s new chief of staff plans to limit the media abst@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kel@@ ly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO records that the White House Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Tru@@ mp - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a regular course .
here is a piece by re@@ porter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kel@@ ly , the White House Chief of Staff , met at his first working day with executives , he represented a major problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s White House which he wanted to repair : bad information that came into the hands of the president .
Kel@@ ly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tru@@ mp by monitoring his media diet .
President Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s relationship with television ranges back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when candidate Tru@@ mp was angry about unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were too convincing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former election campaign consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against Poli@@ tico . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keeping Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter habit under control , according to six ex @-@ election officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter habit ever was &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
maybe these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know about others - that Tru@@ mp@@ s T@@ we@@ ets without their interventions would have even more ignition material .
we will probably never learn about the twe@@ ets that Tru@@ mp didn &apos;t send .
if his associates managed to keep anger away from him a few times , their efforts were worth it .
but no one has consistently been able to prevent Tru@@ mp controversi@@ es .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Tru@@ mp Material that may promote their views of the world .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO - dealing with this story - reported in May about the pre@@ dil@@ ection of advis@@ ors to the president for strategic reasons to supply doubt@@ ful information .
this was an example described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tru@@ mp officials say Tru@@ mp can react like a volcano to negative press cuts , especially those with damaging le@@ aks , and that he can find out where they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was exactly what happened at the end of February , when someone accused the President a printed copy of an article by Got@@ tar@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; being the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of har@@ ass@@ ment or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has expressed false accus@@ ations in the past and rev@@ oked it .
Tru@@ mp read the article and started asking employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ smith added that the then Chief of Staff , Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the General Secretary of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did that work out ?
Kel@@ ly tries to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove himself to be more effective than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ sive self , and his couns@@ ell@@ ors are still striving for influence .
these un@@ changing factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most sought @-@ after criminals receive mail from Euro@@ pol
as the address is unknown , the help of the people will be asked and hoped .
the police across Europe will send post@@ cards to dangerous criminals in this summer ( virtual ) cards .
as the addresses of the searched heavy criminals are not known naturally , references from the population will be hoped and asked .
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday of the action that follows the &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; Advent calendar from winter .
the experiences would have shown that many fle@@ eting sectors are hiding on holiday destinations , it was called by Euro@@ pol .
21 Post@@ cards for searched criminals from 21 EU countries have been compiled .
since 2016 there is the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ ok , more than 2.5 million times this has been viewed .
36 of the online assets could be arrested until now , at least eleven of them based on indications after the publication on the website .
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aire range &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est domestic land@@ lords in the west of Mid@@ lands are again with some resol@@ ute travellers on the war@@ ef@@ oot , who negotiated a tren@@ ch drawn up by the community to rec@@ laim a field from their man@@ sions .
travellers have par@@ ked their 20 caravan on a field outside of a prosper@@ ous road called Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; Million@@ aire series . &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters , after they were thrown out only in May , but without being deter@@ red by a tren@@ ch dug out by the Council , in order to prevent their sei@@ zur@@ es .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in defense posts and squee@@ zed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
angry citizens have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot;
an anonymous resident said : &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent to Bentley He@@ ath where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by .
the Council has to be forced into action by means of shame because it was useless in dealing with the problem .
the travellers were there in May , were moved on and are now back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; more came last night , probably even more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long instruction to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue to pay my community tax if the Council cannot stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an ab@@ orig@@ ine who didn &apos;t want to be called , said , &quot; It &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we &apos;ve just seen the last round of these travellers just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another lap .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the outside of the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to move them as soon as possible .
in order to support our evidence collection , it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this contributes to creating a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Birken@@ hof , the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is made out of the former Hotel Birken@@ hof .
the house in front of Freuden@@ stadt is undergoing renovation and will be re@@ opened on the 1st of March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closing of the Hotel Birken@@ hof by the then Ambiente Betriebs@@ gesellschaft mbH on April 13 , 2014 , approximately 30,000 nights per year were lost and also revenue from the tourist tax .
in the autumn of 2014 , in view of the dramatic increase in numbers of refugees arriving in the administrative district , the hotel building was offered as a collective shelter for controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the Municipal Council .
but above all Freuden@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and spoke at the time of serious interested people at the house .
he should keep right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with Managing Director Birgit Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and will again make it a home of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt @-@ building .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you are welcome Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the former Hotel Birken@@ hof has been in front of the entrance for some time and when you enter the house , it will be clear how extensive renovation works will be made .
the floors were torn out , ceilings partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything should be renewed in the black walnut style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows will be installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pretty bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are part of the facilities .
one does not want to position themselves on the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at a high level of downtown , Sch@@ erer says .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wanted to set up wide , explains Sch@@ erer further .
both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business people will feel comfortable at the hotel .
he talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause , so Sch@@ erer .
the no@@ tions of the city are identical with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the amount of investment required , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to define exactly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just under a million euros , he expects .
the exterior installations are also brought to the front , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , a large terrace is created , which is accessible from the restaurant that is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia affair : U.S. special investig@@ ator sets up Grand Jury
in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tru@@ mp , special investig@@ ators Robert Mu@@ eller should have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee recorded work in recent weeks , wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calling for persons familiar with the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper saw the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expanded and intensified his investigation .
CN@@ N reported that there are already the first inv@@ itations of the committee in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time , pur@@ pos@@ efully interfer@@ ing with the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were agreements between Tru@@ mp@@ s election campaign team and Moscow .
in the focus of the investigations , several men shall stand , who acted as advis@@ ers to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the election campaign .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took more and more Tru@@ mp@@ s private and business environment under the microscope .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a few weeks ago , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote that the Sonder@@ er@@ mid@@ ler Tru@@ mp had personally moved to the center and investigate the accus@@ ation that the president may have hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the wake of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jury is to examine the present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether it should be charged .
Grand Jury votes are therefore also called accus@@ ations .
they are usually switched on when it comes to larger and controversial cases .
the process always takes place behind closed doors .
the body can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor in order to charge persons for the operation under E@@ id .
according to CN@@ N , charges were issued which revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement , called it in the report .
in addition , they should provide documents .
besides Tru@@ mp J@@ r. also Tru@@ mp@@ s couns@@ ell@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ us@@ h@@ ner and his former election campaign chief Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were in conversation .
legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the introduction shows that Mu@@ eller does not let himself be intim@@ id@@ ated in his work and that if necessary , he wants to act quickly .
however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will end up in order to decide on the rise of an indictment .
nevertheless , the establishment of the Gre@@ ens is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for the concern of President Tru@@ mp .
in the midst of the new revelations , the president took a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portra@@ y Russia &apos;s affairs as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the subject give the democr@@ ats a way to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good , because they have nothing else they can talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury .
but this work usually works in secret , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House advoc@@ ates any measures that accelerated the work of the agent in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former FB@@ I boss James Com@@ ey has said three times that not against the President .
you have no reason to assume that something has changed , it was stated in the declaration .
but Mu@@ eller was only used after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this ra@@ ging accus@@ ations , accus@@ ations against Tru@@ mp have been loud , he did not want to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June , Com@@ ey said in front of a Senate Committee , Tru@@ mp urged him to set up investigations against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
according to U.S. media , the White House collected material against the special agent and his collabor@@ ators .
this triggered spec@@ ulation about whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller wanted to release .
unlike an Independent Special Represent@@ ative of the Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair concerning the later retired President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired on the pres@@ idency of the President of the Ministry of Justice .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators presented bill dra@@ fts on Thursday , after which the special dispens@@ er could no longer be dismissed as easily .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : giant ic@@ e@@ berg driving in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the western Antar@@ ctic a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg has loos@@ ened from the scar@@ ce @-@ fold size of Berlin from the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e .
this shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the col@@ os@@ sus , which is heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is now driving north and will probably need two or three years until it mel@@ ted .
with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered in the past three decades .
there is no danger for people from him .
it is unclear to what extent climate change has played a role in the abor@@ tion of the ic@@ e@@ berg .
however , for about 30 years there have been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s of ice c@@ ud@@ dle in the region , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fac@@ tual background .
according to many researchers , this can be related to global warming .
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus had so far been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Shel@@ f .
Shel@@ f swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Shel@@ f is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
to the north of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e , the balance of wa@@ xing and ab@@ rupt was disturbed a few years ago .
a complete cow@@ ard is crum@@ bling there , writes A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is a lot to say that also the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Shel@@ f is in danger , because the front edge has never been as far back as it is currently .
in addition , the ice plate is under voltage and can be dis@@ car@@ ded if a piece break at a key point .
the melting of ice cream and ic@@ e@@ berg does not increase sea level , as they float on the water and ice as much water as it flows after the melting itself .
however , the loss of the ice shelf causes the glaci@@ ers to flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase sea level , but only in a small measure , the British research project writes to the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fin is the fourth largest reserve of Antar@@ c@@ tica with nearly 50 000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters .
it breaks off on a regular basis .
&quot; although it is a natural happening and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ic@@ e@@ plate is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of the British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the broad@@ est retreat since the beginning of the record , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; among scientists it was disputed whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s would now grow back or go back over the long term and possibly collap@@ sed , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Our models say it will be less stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this development will take decades .
although these researchers did not decline this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , many ice @-@ c@@ ud@@ ders of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades .
this long skir@@ t of the Antar@@ ctic extends towards South America .
according to data from the research programme British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the decrease in temperature has contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med up around three degrees in the last 50 years and thus counter@@ s the areas in which the temperature is fastest growing .
CD@@ U wants property tari@@ ff at the staff
because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U , from the employers &apos; association , demands to become more attractive .
just before the summer break , 41 new jobs have been swe@@ pt through the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have their first working day .
the apprentic@@ es@@ hips in the circle are obviously very sought after .
some 6@@ 20 applications were registered for the places to be awarded this year .
nevertheless , the circle is still lacking in order to be able to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
at present , there are still 50 un@@ occupied spots in the district of M@@ ett@@ mann .
among other things , doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought .
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and U@@ WG and counter the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management should work out a concept for recruitment and personnel development according to the wishes of the parties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to not only cover short @-@ term demands on skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented application short@@ ages .
the overall concept should orient@@ ate itself internally and externally , show concrete measures for lateral entran@@ ts and include a training offensive , call for CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities recru@@ it good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a regular &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this purpose , a high number of employees who reti@@ re from the service of illness or age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the highest time for action therefore , so that no more places remain un@@ occupied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Volk , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common motion with his party .
he did not care for a big surprise already in the C@@ ret@@ an day when he publicly challenged the personnel costs and the other parties were amazed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people want all possibilities to be checked that allow a withdrawal from the municipal employers &apos; association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution at short notice , the district administration should aim with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county @-@ related cities - a house tari@@ ff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; peoples . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the CD@@ U tries to pay the employees and officials better than it actually fores@@ ees the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money is only available when you change to a higher level that is oriented towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more over the past few years .
only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up , in which employees care about the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution protection law .
last but not least due to the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too few staff .
Italy sharp@@ ens the tone of NGO migrants &quot; lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they must not continue this if they do not stick to new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis &apos;s warning came a day after the Italian authorities conf@@ isc@@ ated a boat from the German relief organisation &apos; Jugend recover &apos; because their crew had worked effectively with human traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year now , refused to express themselves with detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Am@@ bro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the saving of human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement on the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only assess all accus@@ ations that are being raised until we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from &apos; Jugend recover &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
it is presum@@ ed that its crew takes on board boat migrants , which are supplied to them directly by human traffi@@ ckers , and that the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can go down so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting re@@ port@@ edly took place only 1.3 miles in front of the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s acts , whose contents were published by Italian media .
the crew is suspected of being over@@ looked by the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue missions in the humanitarian grounds and not from any other motives .
under the code of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have previously agreed to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable as they would not bring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significant changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organization is Doc@@ tors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , Minn@@ iti has said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations has declined sharply in recent weeks , indicating that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berliner exter@@ iors &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the North Pal@@ at@@ inate for four days to enjoy the Tri@@ als and the sight@@ se@@ ein@@ gs .
there were three friendly guides available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and wine festival of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome addition .
the first tour led to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim during hot summer temperatures .
it was followed by look@@ out points , partly on towers of which one could see far above the Pal@@ at@@ inate Forest and the up@@ stream layers .
in between there were always longer asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ als rewarded .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and to the folk festival Wur@@ st@@ markt .
again there were look@@ out look@@ out at the look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
on the last two days many al@@ timet@@ ers were announced again .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and in@@ scriptions brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers inhal@@ e healing br@@ ine in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium .
Neustadt became also controlled .
after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group had become acquainted with the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its best side - both sporty and cul@@ turally .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga set itself for E @-@ sport
do the sport stars in the future sit in front of computer consoles instead of swe@@ ating through the stadium racing at wind and weather ?
fact is : e @-@ sport has long been a serious business , has become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high ga@@ its included .
this has also been recognized by the first federal states of Germany who are increasingly engaged in this field .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and recently V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an E @-@ Sport @-@ department in mid @-@ July and took two pro@@ s for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire completely new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure that there are still some clubs rising on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , FIFA World Cup in London organized the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where gam@@ ers from different clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven have qualified for themselves .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in the e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real football has to deal with the 14 @-@ 30 @-@ year @-@ olds , that young people are still going to the stadium in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones .
with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under contract , one could be more often present on these markets online more often than ever to send the German government to Asia once a year .
what is it all about ?
in the E @-@ sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the FIFA World Cup match FIFA at the level of competition .
as in normal sport , Li@@ sts have long established themselves , in which the professionals compete against each other .
and in the Asian Games , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it really a kind of sport ?
for many , the performance is certainly getting used to .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ bing has also dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the German Sport University in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport , because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical responses that can also be found in classical sports - for example increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
in addition , it requires cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast reaction .
professional gam@@ ers should not only train on the console but also exercise their body and pay attention to the diet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the f@@ aded player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ rob@@ bing also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing becomes more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult for online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sports lack@@ ed .
the scientist highlights the highly integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sports .
players are on the international road , which is like a big global family , there are no intercultural barriers .
a study by the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts a rapid growth in the E @-@ sport .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments .
in three years , sales are expected to reach 130 million .
against the 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga , this is little .
however , the e @-@ sport &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; writes the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internationally , many countries are already on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez take part in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood Ac@@ tor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport @-@ Wett@@ providers Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is a lot happening in Europe too .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as a lesson , says F@@ rob@@ bing .
in the Netherlands and in France , the football league clubs according to D@@ utt are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany lag@@ s behind , &quot; says V@@ f@@ B Management Board R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann .
to decay only in no@@ stal@@ gia , and to clarify the ancient times , is no longer enough today .
it is about keeping the tradition of the association , but alig@@ ning the company at the same time on the modern market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ zed world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes D@@ utt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t remember that only football everything stays as it was always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter condem@@ ns , condem@@ ns Con@@ rad Roy for suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend through texts and calls for suicide .
Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years were exposed to par@@ ole .
Car@@ ter was sentenced in June due to a negli@@ gent killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to stay free until the appointment .
she had been faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood there with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and downward facing eyes when she was condemned .
&quot; their actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; the prosec@@ utor said to the court .
&quot; she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she took no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she showed no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ters lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that they totally regret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , Jud@@ ge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he did not find that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant influence on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys nut Lyn@@ n Roy , which said that &quot; there is &quot; no day in which I &apos;m not ber@@ eav@@ ed of the loss of my beloved Son .
I want him to be proud of me and how to deal with everything . I try , despite all my pain , which we will wear for eternity with us to be there for his sisters , &quot; says it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that she would never be part of the wedding of her brother or be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer the only person with whom I have been together since my birth is a pain I am always keeping with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts which makes it a crime to claim another , commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case attracted national attention after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang up , hop from a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is turn on the generator and you &apos;ll be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Car@@ ter &apos;s attention was sought by the death of Roy and ordered that by some press she should benefit from the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
one of the few who defended Car@@ ter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted in Italy in 2007 for murder of her British room@@ mate before being acqu@@ itted two years ago .
Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ ich : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ me was allowed to run on the Audi Cup as a captain is not a coincidence .
the FC Bayern will take a big season to the Con@@ vent Cup winner - extra motivation does not harm you there .
something was different on his place in the cabin , and Joshua took me immediately , even if the additional garment was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he made the tie to his arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer did not announce it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Con@@ vent Cup winner , after his first deployment as Bavaria Captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good , the place could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the character from the coach was able to interpret Kim@@ mir as well .
not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was chosen as a player in the C @-@ El@@ f &apos;s existing C @-@ El@@ f , from youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and just from the holiday .
sugar cane is preferably distributed to those with a lot of herbs that you want to keep in your spirits .
those who have been chosen to approach the heritage of Lah@@ m can only use a little extra motivation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kim@@ mir confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old was flying over the field as a mini @-@ Lah@@ m .
to the right rear , that &apos;s his position , the white tie at the arm did the rest .
and at all , Kim@@ i seemed to be the one who can best take the ru@@ dder into his hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ finished tro@@ upe .
he had the view of the whole while many others were busy with himself .
V@@ idal makes it possible to re@@ play his missing fitness ( folded scar@@ c@@ ely ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches puts on de@@ vil@@ s to get out of the services of the Asia @-@ journey ( also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le are not neg@@ atively infl@@ ated in their first appearance in the Bayern Tri@@ k@@ ot .
after all , it worked quite well .
Sü@@ le ran beside Kim@@ mir , Rud@@ y before the defense , both acted confi@@ dently .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , in addition , Sü@@ le tried to win a few times even in the construction of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Rud@@ y admitted that the result was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not as we hoped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a good performance when she made her debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game shift , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as usual this Bayern @-@ World is still for the newcom@@ ers , one saw in connection with the game .
Rud@@ y , for example , did not give in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs one or two , but determined six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ i said good@@ bye to his new fellow players after some funny statements .
there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; what &apos;s going on here I already noticed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win every game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new .

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ sings Tempo
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still economic minister of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this shows after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
Cham@@ bers and companies from the region speak on T @-@ V @-@ demand of a change in economic policy - and simultaneously charge the old Minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; knowledge attacks the desires of the economy that Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest revers@@ al of the revers@@ al in infrastructure policy : the gap between the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
this year the ministry hopes for a planning procedure until 2021 should be the construction law .
a role in the country &apos;s plans also plays the West surrounding Trier , which stands in the urgent need of the Federal Network of Transport .
the aim is to put the track into operation in December 2020 , says CEO Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
of course , there is a sign@@ post to support regional but internationally competing companies .
the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) seeks Trier , as suggested by Wis@@ sing , an Rheinland @-@ Pf@@ alz @-@ Label in wine to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports dropping for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , the Chamber of Industry commen@@ ds .
the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees an additional incentive for young trainees in the new master bonus , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
there is a premium of 1000 Euro for the passed master examination and 2500 € for graduates to become independent within ten years after the master &apos;s training .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
with the planned road construction , there are quick facts to create , at the same time lacking the country on the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , head of the Chamber of Industry of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier .
56 new engineers who want to employ bis@@ sing in state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art mobility have only had 29 jobs .
the Chamber of Commerce also calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
on the other hand , CD@@ U @-@ group vi@@ ze Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf points out calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country investing more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of country roads in 2017 and 2018 .
in addition , Frank nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country to resolve the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
in addition , the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country is so@@ ber@@ ing .
in 2016 , regional companies assessed net supply in an I@@ HK @-@ survey only with the rating 3.@@ 4 .
they compl@@ ained about mol@@ ded internet connections and qu@@ arri@@ es .
ex @-@ economic minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still sitting on the board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe - where they cleared the field after four months due to in@@ consist@@ encies .
Audi should change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction
one day before Audi &apos;s announcement , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW chair said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are smar@@ ter options than driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so he moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles modified in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as call@@ back .
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions regulations .
but the nitrogen ox@@ ides that em@@ it diesel engines are regarded as carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the cost of car manufacturers to install machinery to neutr@@ alize the exhaust gas emissions from diesel vehicles also increases what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of under@@ mining the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the failures of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called off @-@ stop devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but driving back under normal driving conditions .
several Volkswagen employees were indic@@ ted in the United States , others are being examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former Head of Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the Audi engine development in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from ex@@ tradition and could be put in court in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was incorporated into German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circum@@ vent the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States has been extended .
Volkswagen &apos;s involvement in the investigation could seriously impact Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer is over@@ propor@@ tionally contributing to Volkswagen win .
this message has the raft on Saturday at Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order for the Is@@ ar visitor to participate , a raft passes through Munich on mor@@ ally Saturday , which has a special message .

on the raft you can see a big inf@@ ot@@ ran@@ spar@@ ent .
it shows a garbage dump .
the pr@@ el@@ ude to a public@@ ity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love is ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar will be sharpen@@ ed as a protected game of game . &quot; &quot; &quot;

mor@@ ain@@ less cra@@ b n@@ oses and laughter against the suffering
at times Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ ons of carto@@ ons , the rab@@ ies of his characters are his trademark .
also with 85 the Argent@@ ine@@ an is still painting and working on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he was a painter , among other things , as a symbol of greetings cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once .
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came at the end of the six@@ ties : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in Paris Match and then in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figur@@ ines cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own data , he is still sitting at the drawing table , working daily for almost ten hours .
over cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and clo@@ cks continue to find its funny figures worldwide .
he has been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters for six years .
the protagon@@ ist in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings , which has a thousand foot@@ ball@@ ers as opponent .
for the first time , his figures in the 3D movie , which should come to the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s odd for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
this is why he tends to rely on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced without word .
la@@ ven@@ der threatened by climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of dro@@ ught and insect @-@ transferring insects , which are causing great head@@ aches to scientists and farmers trying to find solutions .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the Agricultural Research Institute CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered , because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change that has caused much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn .
this has an impact on the life of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small Zi@@ k@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that transfers d@@ warf gra@@ c@@ ads , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much in the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil attracts not only holi@@ day@@ makers , it is also very popular for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Eric Cha@@ isse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and the slow@@ ing of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dro@@ ught .
the little town of Gei@@ sha in the Thurin@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1200 @-@ year anniversary .
the highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a Medi@@ eval festival .
dealers , guil@@ ds , dealers , vag@@ u@@ ers or a landing pad are to be experienced at these days in the city center .
the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the Week@@ ly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on recent may@@ hem in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about safety .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children to the office which were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them home .
security experts wrote three words on a table on the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies .
they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and abdominal feelings reach .
there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the government &apos;s pay@@ roll or cart@@ els , a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no rest from violence , and while the bodies accum@@ ulate throughout the country , more and more journalists are involved : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to took office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are facing attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there were at least seven deaths in seven states .
among the latter are her editors and her inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deep , although his presence is everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two re@@ porters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez wear t @-@ shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared topics , trauma , night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a special prosec@@ utor &apos;s office was established in 2010 in order to edit the cases of journalists , the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists initiated only two criminal proceedings .
as with most thousands of mur@@ ders , which are linked to drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime every year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely placed in court .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ comfor@@ ting and although the terrain is now more tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why we are susp@@ icious of everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of 15 May Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to go a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; twelve river . &quot;
the sho@@ oter went away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an freely .
but on the topic of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the past year and delivery to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the country &apos;s bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields , as rival groups are struggling here to fill the vacuum .
it does not matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings that are larger than many houses for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States .
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
first , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ ica Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival tru@@ sts in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the children , presum@@ ed gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second fault was to not force Val@@ dez to leave the country for his own security after the conf@@ isc@@ ation of another newspaper , which had published the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced journalist for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he co@@ operated with five colleagues for the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollar hol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drug poison problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with time , the newspaper earned a reputation as a result of courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
re@@ porters cher@@ ished it to be able to publish hard @-@ fitting investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to treat .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for her coverage in Latin America .
in the same year Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursuit of Mexican drug history wherever she led .
he volunte@@ ered that he was sc@@ ared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need to take over the task , which falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What have you done in the face of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you say what went ahead ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who was able to curse like a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit there at the same table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Was his love for routine be his destruction ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to best deal with her work and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like to deal with their wives , their children , their clean stores , their secret run@@ ways &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust your own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the anger is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happens with J@@ avier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape is changing constantly .
in the room where the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , no mobile phones were allowed . days earlier it became known that Spy@@ ware , sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ sia in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ size district of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters asked themselves if these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police officers , who are not trust@@ worthy of the governor themselves .
it is months since the re@@ porters have gone to the mountain landscape where drug gangs are de facto under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ sia has focused on three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the former famous box@@ er Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an exposure to the state expendi@@ tures focusing on the home town of the governor .
and there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block away from the office of the prosec@@ utor , performing a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the reig@@ ning Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which ruled almost the whole century all the political planes .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of corruption of high cali@@ bre .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack .
only a few months earlier , the readers of Val@@ dez had considered the best informed source of kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in former times we knew what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office became a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press .
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez sn@@ apped up a few signs and the next morning he went to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA testing that it is his .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the whole country , journalists have become lou@@ der by writing in organized protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on foot@@ paths and constructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on that day , director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the Val@@ dez case .
at a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and let them kill because they said the truth .
she has since asked her to be re @-@ classified by the government because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime , the government officials and an equal society . &quot;
in his latest book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters are not only killed by drug gangs but also on orders of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a ceiling with organised crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the media group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been allocated more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and civil servants last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found together with a note that allegedly was signed by the Z@@ et@@ as cart@@ el : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones were lying next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close , as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to make El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists fled from their native states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it &apos;s hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted as it seems to be the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City .
for those who stay behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be po@@ ets , admitted that drug traffi@@ cking shocked him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I was re@@ porter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ sia were sitting on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drinking beer , when all their phones began to hum@@ p at once .
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with riv@@ ri@@ vals and security forces near the seaside resort of Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continues to escal@@ ate as promised by a number of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from the side@@ ways , they released the news on the Ri@@ odo@@ ce website about mobile phones .
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens he@@ ul@@ fed nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez looked at the polic@@ emen who kept watch , to see if they were willing .
if they were sc@@ ared at all , they did not show it .
under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible to the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you keep thinking about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if on the same day J@@ avier was murdered , the intern asked me to send them to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to avoid its enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , albeit a frigh@@ tening .
researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the incredible N@@ ash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian min@@ er have been so well received that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they could even find that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said that she had had something of an &quot; troubled past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guarded din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the world &apos;s best din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his unbeliev@@ ably well @-@ preserved state has start@@ led researchers who describe it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he was on 21 March 2011 at the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , dug .
he met something that seemed out of the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy earth cl@@ ump@@ ing .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you only b@@ link a little with your eyes , you could almost believe it has slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
researchers have found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , although it is covered with arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily @-@ ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as counter@@ f@@ eit , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed it to get better into its surroundings and to sof@@ ten its enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by major din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family made head@@ lines in May and is now in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and it was called Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta Mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum technician Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team who spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours with it carefully .
the remarkable preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
they discovered the con@@ ter@@ sh@@ ading , a common defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was dark@@ er than its under@@ side .
although the con@@ ter@@ ation is common , the results are surprising as the size of the Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds the animals living today .
it suggests that the din@@ osau@@ r was driven by enough pressure by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that the evolution fav@@ oured the disgu@@ ise of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use con@@ ter@@ sh@@ ading - think of roe deer , zeb@@ ras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than loo@@ t , indicating that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r pre@@ dat@@ ors of the chal@@ k have to have been , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to examine the animal in evidence of his life , including his preserved intest@@ ines , in order to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , fell into a river and driven out into the sea , where he sank to the se@@ abed on the back .
at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as South Fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much far@@ ther inland than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preserved fl@@ ak@@ y skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal is almost as good today as in the early chal@@ k period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you only look a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it is sleeping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period was a time when gigantic ther@@ op@@ ods , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs standing on two legs crossed the earth .
although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monster .
scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the ocean and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he was on 21 March 2011 at the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , dug .
according to the museum , it is the guarded din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures on average were about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that prot@@ ru@@ ded from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the arm@@ oured her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous was swe@@ pt through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .
but the underwater hull of the din@@ osau@@ r kept its arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so good that the st@@ alli@@ ons are still covering hol@@ ly arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r .
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is so &apos; rare as a winning in the lot@@ tery .
the more I look , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that carry the skull of the animal .
its right foref@@ oot is on its side , its five fingers are spread upwards .
I can count the sheds at his sole . &apos;
in the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
violent accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 cars are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ ster .
there are numerous wounded , kilometres long St@@ aus and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) about 20 people were injured in the late afternoon on Thursday afternoon .
after the first data of the police were between the junction of Adel@@ ten@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ kreis A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm almost 30 vehicles , including trucks , collap@@ sed together .
there are no indications of the exact number of injured persons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a question of light to moderate injuries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large supply of rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was closed in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of travel in Munich , an approximately ten kilometer long back@@ log was formed .
as an A@@ Z re@@ porter reports , there came also on the counter @-@ road to massive han@@ di@@ caps - through numerous g@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade listed the characteristics of the vehicle drivers who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pun@@ ish@@ ments .
shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident occurred at the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group test &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : nothing investig@@ ates in the train and sleeps .
or one is deep@@ ened into his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buff@@ alo .
comes the conductor and w@@ akes an uns@@ hip or pul@@ ls the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket inspection .
one simply confirms by mobile phone that one takes its place and de@@ valu@@ ates the ticket .
currently , a test operation is running on two tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come the offer , we extend it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available on many other long @-@ haul routes in Germany in the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Bahn spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the ticket de@@ valuation without Schaff@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be able to use them , however , some requirements must be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - which already most passengers do .
it is also necessary to have purchased the DB Navigator app , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway .
and last but not least you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; functions so : one climbs into the train , calls his ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a button on the electronic de@@ valuation appears at the test customers .
the train companions get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seats Y .
when the train driver arrives at No@@ .@@ Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already paid online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , continue working , keep silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which is to take advantage of passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to travel relaxed without ticket inspection by our train compan@@ ying staff , simply check the DB Navigator itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this enables passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , member of the Marketing Director of DB Fern@@ verkehr .
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often run the train know that apart from delays and missed trains , ticket inspec@@ tors are among the greatest offen@@ ders .
because often you have , in any case , one of the fellow travelers does not have all the documents you need to de@@ valuation online tickets .
either the credit card or identity card or otherwise a document you have to show is missing .
the result is endless discussions between ten@@ ants and passenger , which leads to a bad mood in the cabin or large room and delays in the control of one &apos;s own ticket and the conductor takes the time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that also only on the links ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other train numbers on the same route are not un@@ locked yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Britt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sha@@ ken up to her core .
only one day after she arrived in New York City , the church in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled over a post from someone from High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police has just killed a 18 year old child , and it &apos;s still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , because nobody else posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly saved on her tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 year old who was killed live by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed .
he posted an image of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she put her cell phone off to return later in the evening to twe@@ ets over people on the Can@@ field Drive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there were photos from the police and people crying out and of a man who claimed to be Brow@@ ns &apos;s father who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she watched a live feed where a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman secured his ri@@ f@@ le and cried : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l remembered her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt shi@@ vering .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cin@@ emas from the 11th .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resili@@ ence that exists from the point of view of the people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rel@@ l with her daughter , who carried a flower @-@ dress and a suitable crown , went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two discussed a conversation that they had innum@@ erable times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people need to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I could not take them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know it and see it and be pulled up in it .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also know the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves .
even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blat@@ ant racism , she is no different from the next black women @-@ child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would do it a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first stop , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police station , which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ accus@@ ation of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l form .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely after 9 August , &quot; she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything has come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later Fer@@ rel@@ l met during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r just wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l asked a question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this scep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resili@@ ence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born and grew up in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not cent@@ red their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt occup@@ ants .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other locals the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns was shooting .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; Davis said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me how these people are represented , because so I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ ara &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; was not a Messiah @-@ leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she turned out to be the most apparent participant in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ is &apos;s life as she falls in love and married her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ isation of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ is &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the Movement , who after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin , in 2012 marked the film &quot; Black@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have worn the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must bear the main burden of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Fer@@ rel@@ l was selected as the heart of the film because of its identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who stir@@ red up this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s no accident , although it was in front of the front because at a life at these crosses it was as a black , gay woman standing so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel your energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile , the communication cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the racial links between the church and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she describes the social @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chaos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she went to the street in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support one another .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss bit gallery
the bit gallery moves people even though it hasn &apos;t been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian area has since the first presentation in 2009 divi@@ des the population in advoc@@ ates and opponents .
there is hardly any cold on the subject .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the one to the bit gallery says : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ dt ) , comes from the other side : &quot; no man needs &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while the pro@@ pon@@ ents build a gallery attract more customers , from which the rest of the shops will benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding .
in addition : the gallery is planned exactly on the premises where the farmers market hall is located , in which 13 direct markets offer their products .
with the beginning of the construction work will be finished .
the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - for Bed@@ a @-@ Platz , with possibility to sit outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Simone Zimmer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many years we have been shopping almost weekly in the farmers market hall . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the rural women love again and again .
also the but@@ cher &apos;s shop we discovered for us .
we would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities this is also possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing is located in a market hall in the gallery , the amount of rent depends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this should not be low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what purchasing palaces in Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether it &apos;s clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets , I think that &apos;s unnecessary .
there are already enough of them in our city .
you can see how many shops are vac@@ ant here - some for months and years .
since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall will be preserved .
after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is cheap at the top .
as you can see , shops are rented in a shopping centre only from larger companies , because the r@@ ents there are often not portable for a retailer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; too bad , specialty shops are almost no longer and that which is left of it will probably disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping centre with a market hall does not suit me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where should the farmers market hall look like during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or does it create the gh@@ ost bit gallery before selling all the stores from Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it won &apos;t work .
and a shopping center , which is empty , no one needs .
in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery .
but thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg are no longer a place for a farmers market hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when the farmers market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces can be seen - white , black and brown , almost indi@@ st@@ ingu@@ ish@@ able - hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ anks and hair@@ cuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former intelligence analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year sentence after publicly tra@@ ded diplomatic noti@@ fications about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opened on 2nd August is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( A matching simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline has united her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and dis@@ sident dis@@ sident , whose conviction of Barack Obama was transformed when he had only three days in his office .
through the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA extracted by Mann@@ ing , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg originated from the 30 portraits , as someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data could look like , a sharp , albeit a somewhat intellectual commentary , not only to the forms of DNA @-@ data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also to identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but had already talked openly about the identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced to 20 counts in 2013 , including six violations of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison her image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing deliberately sits on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum blonde wig - associated with her .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came just from the great success of their 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
in it , the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette but@@ ts and ch@@ ewing gum by extrac@@ ting DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like .
this was the time she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition .
and she could not be visited at that time and she couldn &apos;t be photograph@@ ed , so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use became un@@ equal bri@@ ph@@ ews , who replaced several letters over the course of two years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they even created a comic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ah Kan@@ ung@@ o , which fores@@ aw a future in which the President of Chelsea would transform his judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that Obama actually was only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as would demand was a welcome type of happy meeting .
there is something deep and strong now at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tru@@ mp carries out a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against Trans@@ gender @-@ forces to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to keep the rigid divisions that he was supposed to fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing with her over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her sur@@ name is marked with a heart ) an end of &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , based on gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ ler of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des after the highly developed scientific en@@ cyclo@@ pedia of the artist ) , how amazing , at least in biological terms , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully take away is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care who we are and how openly genetic data are for an interpretation and how subj@@ ectively they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , also to be seen .
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the above mentioned comic novel .
it shows Mann@@ ing as she emerges with a hands @-@ free teleph@@ ony in the hand from the disciplinary bar@@ racks of the United States like King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they talk about your words , they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ ets Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but when it was to do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ ors that rally like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing stat@@ ure ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also hiding behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor at the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University for Kil@@ l
a nationwide ch@@ ase is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford who were looked for as susp@@ ects after a man was stab@@ bed to death in a luxury apartment in Chicago .
on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , the acts of the District Court of Cook County have been shown .
the documents say Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several en@@ grav@@ ings .
a public warning system published by the Chicago police authorities states that the cor@@ p@@ se was discovered on 27 July .
officials received a call , arrived at Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead at the place of events , and det@@ ec@@ tives examine the en@@ grav@@ ings as murder while the police actively seek the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
La@@ a has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cub@@ ende , vice @-@ president of university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them should now be in leave and excluded from entering the Campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal affair , examined by the competent authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ isch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of the university and the Somer@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in any conceivable way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to be .
chief Communications Officer of the police station of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said that he strongly urge the susp@@ ects to ask the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to locate them reinforce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities are helping to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said .
the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the victim &apos;s background and resear@@ ches a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will finish the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the Russian Vice @-@ Champion Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian Vice @-@ Rec@@ tor Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it will not take long to be implemented until the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ USA@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain stage of meeting the requirements of the road@@ map , R@@ USA@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with Ukrain ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA timet@@ able was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA &apos;s schedule to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for the re@@ integration of R@@ USA@@ DA and recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he doesn &apos;t contain anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has been announced , everything is implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , one of the criteria listed in the list states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the study approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren for alleged state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russian sport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of the matter , mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no government programs , and we will not add anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ kos &apos;s words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing Commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales office , at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organisations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one imag@@ ines to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in November 2015 , R@@ USA@@ DA was excluded from the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia as part of the dop@@ ing sc@@ andal .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( UK@@ AD ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA General Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli explained that R@@ USA@@ DA &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moves in the right direction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be used again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ di doesn &apos;t sell eggs for the time being
this was shared by the company groups .
it was a pure precau@@ tion , and no health impair@@ ment could be assumed , it was reported in the communication .
from now on only eggs should be delivered to Al@@ di , which have demonstr@@ ably been tested negative on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ ous anti @-@ l@@ ump @-@ lice .
Al@@ di wants to create clarity and transparency with its customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your company not to become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys didn &apos;t work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ently .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not mo@@ urn the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Corporation Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has called people from outside for help .
a new breed of Human Resources start @-@ ups is growing in order to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software , which has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to address surveys , offer special groups and demographic groups , to offer employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases , whist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to circum@@ vent the C @-@ Suite managers and directly contact the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking your health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your business ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said that they have a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t won .
in addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low approval results - so you can re@@ bo@@ unce why .
companies are coming to see that at the head of the workplace culture must remain , so that you won &apos;t be the next u@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment in which those who have spoken have been punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , according to the Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments financial website .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and recognize bad behavior , seen an increasing interest and activity in the middle of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Con@@ ver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
u@@ ber has recently signed up as a client .
as G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent makes customized &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the warmth maps of your problem areas .
it also provides an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that allows employees to report bad behavior .
and if the chief executive is involved , complaints direct to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the courts of public opinion have captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a company is found that treats its employees badly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , Con@@ ver@@ cent has used for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their headquarters .
in the past , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or e @-@ mail for the headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously .
it was often a intim@@ id@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ Y@@ S General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees .
now , as the company uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems previously identified by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states were identified and addressed faster than discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment , or unfair intern@@ ships .
&quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the Risk Management Group of Ru@@ by Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies started to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Engagement in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen broke out because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry on @-@ line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service and charge companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that will support Venture Capital investors who supported both start @-@ ups .
cent received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total amount of capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ it@@ tering has secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , bringing its total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising , given the networked nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees are more likely to expect from their jobs than before .
high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only possible in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley .
the employees want the feeling that you will be accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that is their voices , and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel stronger commitment to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience with Link@@ ed@@ In that uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t .
investors reach returns when their portfolio companies operate well . companies run well when employees are committed and committed .
when the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment to employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the administrator of a company does not take action .
in fact , when a company asks employees for your feedback , it may have a expectation that change is on the way .
and if the changes don &apos;t come fast enough or not at all , this can breed dis@@ appointments and demo@@ tiv@@ ate employees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be willing to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management firm Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have too much left to collect data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you don &apos;t follow , employees will ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you take care of that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now performs monthly staff surveys , was able to initiate actions on the same day , when a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , she was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
with Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company receives new insights into the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better binding of employees in a branch that is well @-@ known for high turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , then you will lose companies .
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it starts at 23 o &apos;clock , when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A football players enter@@ tain on one side of the new exercise fields of the team on campus .
some have pulled out their tri@@ cot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these in@@ active minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are en@@ rolled in the summer courses will return to their final examinations after the three hour exercise before returning to the Water@@ man Football Center the next morning at 6 : 30 p.m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ ret@@ mühle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the guys the next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ck @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday became Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the player &apos;s load , and she has actually extended her days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three trainings of U@@ CL@@ A should start at 19 : 15 to meet the already fully packed timet@@ ables of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Brotherhood shifted the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as conducted six playing times in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they are to hold 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before the beginning of formal game preparations for their kick @-@ off against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supported the change of rules of the N@@ CA@@ A even if they add another point to the multip@@ lier routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous burden on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it through , they plac@@ e@@ ze on , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will end its practice as soon as the camp is finished , which in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the upper class that has already been abandoned with foot@@ balls , which will be a protective net behind a gate post , no easy task will be .
Bru@@ kin &apos;s players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there might be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far fet@@ ched to think that people can hire a room there and then set up there to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good business .
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking place 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
that is why I don &apos;t worry too much about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts review in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false news items from third parties and then show their results below the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network announced on Thursday . it &apos;s one of its efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in an opinion on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible false messages and send them to fac@@ tual verification that might display results of the fact check from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced U.S. presidential elections in 2016 .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being flooded with false stories ahead of the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan that social media networks should be punished if they fail to quickly eliminate h@@ water @-@ filled post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook told us in a separate declaration in German that a test of the new facts examination was launched in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; besides the knowledge , which stories are challenged by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product manager for Facebook messages in a blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; test its feature &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related item &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and is working on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creation of a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 and 1980 &quot; s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy seat in the lush River Valley in K@@ ent and now has become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a cosmop@@ olitan Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s so nice to look at someone who &apos;s dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says unanim@@ ously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families that lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist , Isaac Ste@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found emo@@ tionally emotional .
&quot; I just re@@ acted to the thumb print on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &quot; s that worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb print ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell as smoke , because at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself is there too .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived for almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome greeting &quot; ) all this seems too nice to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he walked through the grounds and ruins of the old castle , and spoke with landscape nur@@ ses , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then at night he d@@ rank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whis@@ key &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and started writing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust received full access only in 2006 , when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to take care of the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years , in which aristoc@@ rats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Empire , cards that represent who possessed something : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought for the two families .
&quot; &quot; &quot; guys , let all go their gear ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se themselves in English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a record of a rebellion in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ fe Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought that an uprising was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it patron , which the Dar@@ rel@@ l family hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the smu@@ gg@@ ler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l is portra@@ yed in the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gent@@ lemen seemed to be quite a cro@@ ok , always making debts and spending money on things they couldn &apos;t afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l @-@ men solved their debt crisis by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to advertise land@@ lady . &quot;
after the end of his use in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique write experiences
he has placed a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ mer@@ mä@@ ki , the site of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle is covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the inauguration of the 301 @-@ year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Honnef has launched its campaign for the introduction of a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) on Friday .
until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team around Nelson Ar@@ tz want to keep the logo and slogan hidden .
at the end of August there will be a feast on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the makers of the promotion have been asking the posters at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think ( of course ! ) &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; they write on their yesterday released website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we believe that as bad Honne@@ fer , we are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ encomp@@ assing promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , she stands in competition with other commun@@ es .
the city of Bad Honnef is able to cost its new umbrella brand and campaign for an average five @-@ digit amount .
military reforms in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s fear of the army
each year in early August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises on pensions and carriage in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first glance a normal process .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the attempted put@@ sch .
the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as before , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
under the chair@@ manship of the He@@ ads of State , the five vice @-@ ministers and ministers for defence , home affairs , justice and foreign affairs took part in the discussions .
thus civilians in Y@@ AS were in number .
the government is pulling the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the Army , the Air Force and the Navy were dismissed .
since the failed coup leader Erd@@ og@@ an has fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees Erd@@ og@@ an as the wire @-@ pul@@ ler of the attempted put@@ sch .
against 4@@ 86 persons who were directly involved in the attempted put@@ sch , Ankara has been involved in Ankara this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erd@@ og@@ an had called the overthrow of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; God &apos;s gift &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clean &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Erd@@ og@@ an really has a grip on the army ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ ease in the Military Head@@ quarters &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ fests itself in the lifting of the he@@ address ban for female soldiers , wrote the paper .
in any case , the big carp@@ entry in the army and the security forces continues .
in mid @-@ July Erd@@ og@@ an ordered another 7@@ 3@@ 95 civilian servants , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed that Erd@@ og@@ an had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were old earlier than the actual lords of the country .
three times they listened to their role as a guar@@ dian of the secular state order .
after his election victory in 2002 Erd@@ og@@ an pushed aside the power of the military step by step , not least of his appeal to the reform pres@@ crip@@ tions of the European Union .
former officers say Erd@@ og@@ an drove targeted Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a name not so @-@ called officer who sought asylum in foreign countries after the attempted put@@ sch , the Turkish army will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists in a few years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if that happens , such a development could not leave Nato cold .
anyway , in the Alliance after the pur@@ ges there are doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tru@@ mp , cited by the media .
it envis@@ ages lowering the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules on obtaining visa for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented visa .
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the draft bill should be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do so by the US to change the way citizens are issued from other countries of Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp , quoted by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate track for road shuttle
over the past few months , over the past few months have been argu@@ ing about the future of the race course sh@@ utt@@ les - now it should go quite fast .
&quot; &quot; &quot; before the end of the year , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nau@@ tical track &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be built on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourist railway &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to secure the future of the race course sh@@ utt@@ les in the long run , construction works on the route are scheduled to begin this year according to the Ministry of Transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to continue to order and repair the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country comm@@ its itself to this especially important connection for the tourism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Secretary of State Klaus Pun@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the repair of the track were estimated at approx . 2.5 million euros .
of this sum , the country over@@ took 75 percent .
the contract , on which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country also in the future , will be finally agreed , declared at@@ oning death .
the Ministry and the South Thurin@@ gian Rail@@ ways as operators are already in agreement with the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this means that the Renn@@ stei@@ g Shuttle will be ordered regular on December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a rail link between the Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g railway stations , especially for tourists .
over the past few months , it has been tested in the course of a pilot operation to determine whether the route is used by sufficient number of people to order it regularly in the future .
the route is also strongly b@@ ump@@ y in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry
just as you thought it can &apos;t become even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots arrives .
yes , actually .
sex robots are currently a great deal .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Emer@@ itus Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University She@@ ff@@ ield and Co @-@ Fo@@ under of the FR@@ R , we must start taking their Ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of ni@@ pp@@ le and type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of them , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey when he released his new report .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adapt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it becomes even more disturbing since many robots have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who would have made a step@@ ford woman progressive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sc@@ rap@@ pers have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ Bo@@ ti@@ x robot , for example , enables its users to adapt their robots to properties that they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion , with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which conve@@ ys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; enth@@ uses the website of True Compan@@ ion .
so she likes what you like and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day she also has her mo@@ ods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female qualities , the all@@ u@@ sions to rape if you take a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( i.e. here : reluc@@ tant ) Far@@ rah , troubled one most .
on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy is compatible with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just a different sex toy .
their formation and increasing sophistic@@ ation point to something dark@@ er and deeper in our culture , towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional en@@ core .
most men naturally won &apos;t hold any sex @-@ robots , and while the FR@@ R notes their growing popularity , they still remain on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture .
but what transp@@ ires from the boundary zones can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission to do so .
there is a certain overl@@ apping that these highly developed sex robots are emerging in a time where women &apos;s rights are threatened all over the world , in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted to have women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted .
the most horrible aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the dev@@ oured body and the st@@ och@@ astic eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap .
the aim behind these sex robots is to produce a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as real@@ istically as technically possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel humane that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , when it comes to their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companions or simply go away .
they have no mediation or background history , nothing that hin@@ ders independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission .
in other words , they are fake slaves .
or to express it in the Rede@@ mption of 2017 : maid Girl
tru@@ mp great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of the common sense of man
it has become a tru@@ mp of the Tru@@ mp era that the political divisions that pol@@ arized US voters have also split families in small format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving there were newspapers with advice in the USA about how to deal with the horror of Tru@@ mp choosing relatives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;re all preten@@ ding to let our filter bags burst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
less noticed is the power of bringing families together .
I mention this because my cous@@ in , a left @-@ facing poet who lives in Chicago and has long occupied with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful impact .
with Tru@@ mp in the White House , everyone knows it , including the republi@@ can relationship with which they fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and completely strange on the same page .
for the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it is in a further context that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the dis@@ figur@@ ing effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that one day his bi@@ bs will no longer meet us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is , however , an even more terri@@ fying long @-@ term scenario in which Tru@@ mp rep@@ ublic@@ ans norm@@ alize the right wing , which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards .
today I find myself falling from an active no@@ stal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ com@@ ical version of the mad@@ man - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how to see his tax return ) - both in fact occur as a very mild criminal off@@ ence compared to Tru@@ mp .
when Tru@@ mp enters , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be only spiritually healthy in order to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my cous@@ in was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the New York Parks Department , and the top three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need a caffeine .
the horses are huge , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are grow@@ led and the animals turn out to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ per@@ ming music im@@ parts this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings become old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not completely over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the topics pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage does not count - but a large roundabout in the north of London .
however , the Central Park @-@ car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magic experience , as two two @-@ year @-@ old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ year @-@ old can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could have scored the car@@ ous@@ el I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked for it .
on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required .
the poor woman in the department store stood ap@@ ologi@@ zing , while I was tired of the experience to hand her my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us has left prison for a hospital visit .
last year he was hospit@@ alized due to the treatment of cuts to his w@@ ri@@ sts , which he suffered according to a case in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence due to murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , by firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ t@@ oria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a noc@@ tur@@ nal intru@@ der hiding in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention , this time against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , from which they say that it is too len@@ i@@ ent .
the National Criminal Inves@@ tigation Department said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal can be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us is in danger that his sentence will be increased to 15 years when the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the sh@@ ot@@ ers from F@@ ury and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into the holidays and in the secondary schools .
three of the students will go to the secondary school in the future , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening , school director An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
the 29 students of the four classes headed by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der selected a young eagle that grows in the chicken farm , but then released into freedom .
in addition , the m@@ lower band performed a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle in the Chi@@ cken Farm . &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg and let it hat@@ ch from his chi@@ ckens .
instead of a chicken @-@ cold , a small eagle was coming out .
but the hope of making him a chicken fell , and the eagle stretched out his wings on a high mountain , and s@@ wore .
after that the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken @-@ dance .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young goat , the cylinders wore to the bet .
the eagle stands for integration , said school director An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte .
the young may be different from the other young ( chi@@ cks ) , but belong to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
she wished every four @-@ four@@ ths sh@@ red@@ der that he feels accepted in his new school .
this was followed by a thank@@ sgiving to the colleagues , the former Schul@@ leiter , Michael Müller , who is constantly jumping into instruc@@ tional classes , and the parents &quot; representatives .
the kitchen time is over now , explained teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher .
after two years of teaching , they only leave their students very reluc@@ tant because it had been a really great time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , they can rely on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Viert@@ ler &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , all students had a song of summer time and holiday season .
in doing so , great joy broke out among the children .
eight first @-@ grade students have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camp@@ ings in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted by television .
in the morning of 1 August , a group of illeg@@ ally camp people was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day they were released while an investigation is underway .
the State Department reported on B@@ TV that Bulg@@ arians were released later .
the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control of the free camping and place each one who is found to stay in a place that is not meant for this purpose , substantial fin@@ es .
the controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impose a fine fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what the people affected need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.@@ 3 million cars .
they should improve the emissions behaviour of cars of emission classes Euro 5 and partially Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in of the ACE Auto Club Europa provides assessments :
is the new action obligatory ?
no , the software updates tra@@ ded are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the obligatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schumann @-@ Software &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their retro@@ fitting has ordered the Federal Aviation Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced spe@@ edy implementation over the next few months , but not yet mentioned a precise date .
Daimler announces to notify every affected person .
if any inspection is due anyway , this will be done within the framework .
how long will the conver@@ sions take place ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; S@@ met@@ an@@ in writes .
the relationships are dependent on the commitment of manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen , the autom@@ akers do not act voluntarily on the subject of the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming it can be to get an appointment .
what do drivers do , who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ?
the ACE advises to wait .
presumably foreign manufacturers would consult S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
is there a massive down@@ fall of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears this .
but in the regions where driving b@@ ans thre@@ aten .
in rural areas , there is no loss of value for older diesel so far .
the ACE advises to wait for a sale yet .
ll Cool J wins Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving under President Tru@@ mp promises to become political .
one of the winners does not want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) gets the first ra@@ pper one of the cov@@ eted prizes of the prestigious Kennedy Center .
this year , as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) are among the hon@@ orable .
awards are awarded at the beginning of December .
traditionally , US President Donald Tru@@ mp will hold a reception and participate with his wife Mel@@ ania at the award ceremony .
the award winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV series therefore already announced that he would refrain from participating in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to completely negl@@ ect the arts and human rights - even to depri@@ ve them of the means - and that weighs on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she will use Tru@@ mp to clarify her views .
the Kennedy Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .
the former prize winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , reti@@ res in the coming year .
the job is already written out - but suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been a city builder for 31 years .
and the work is still great fun for him , as he medi@@ ates in the press conference .
he reports about varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor .
at the same time , it is surprising that no application has been submitted to the requirements profile until now .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the next possible time .
this means that - in compliance with the regular periods of notice - there is still enough time for a famili@@ arization .
since Has@@ lach works as a sub @-@ legal authority for the administrative community , the applicant must point out corresponding agreements .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if it would no longer be able to fill it , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice .
but clos@@ eness to the citizen is the city and it is important to him , says W@@ acker , who reports about a good working climate and a good mood among the authorities and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some significant projects have accumulated , looking back at the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the Bau@@ amt and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen parking space are about to be initiated .
the zig@@ z@@ ag bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium restoration is still subject .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter will strike at about 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
there is great le@@ e@@ way for a city builder .
Has@@ la@@ chs &apos;s own building yard and gar@@ dener can react very flexibly to many .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the old town is listed as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye for what is fit , &quot; if new buildings are approved , the divi@@ der Stadt@@ bau@@ meister emphasizes .
in any case , the city @-@ builder carries a high degree of responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything runs over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with care and coordination he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been there for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been working for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , that his successor remains long , W@@ acker wants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to be identified and remain with the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further development of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you would like to be buried by Roland W@@ acker , according to the city of Has@@ lach , a completed academic or a bach@@ el@@ or &apos;s degree with subject @-@ related architecture should be able to demonstrate and have good knowledge in the areas of building planning and construction planning law .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt für Hoch@@ - und Tief@@ bau , Building Gui@@ deline , Gr@@ on@@ wer@@ bs@@ an@@ Opport@@ unities , Administration of Urban Property , Municipal Cour@@ tyard with Bau@@ hof and municipal gardening and Lower Construction Law Authority , including monument protection .
bicycle made on lines : closed on the south
according to the police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bike from the rail@@ road crossing in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were damaged so badly that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out from two male offen@@ ders and have been searching for them since the night hours .
close to the crime scene , a ros@@ ary roller and a bike driver had been observed by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Laus@@ bu@@ ben@@ st@@ reich &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch at the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ators would have brought themselves into great danger and je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed train traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant as well as the delay and the costs for rail freight transport , cor@@ als from the railway customers could also be sent to the offen@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; overall , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum should be taken out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the south railway track could be led without any obstruc@@ tions .
just under ten passenger trains were cancelled Friday morning , two of them considered the correspondence .
freight trains did not fall out , but they were late .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study asser@@ ts exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el diseases .
the incur@@ able condition affecting around 1.3 million in the United States and 300@@ ,000 in the United Kingdom causes stomach cr@@ amps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recurring or bloody diarr@@ ho@@ ea , loss of weight and extreme fatigue .
while suffer@@ ers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins helps develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant col@@ on .
the conduc@@ tive researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the gut pat@@ rol to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food do not penetrate into the body .
cells that are capable of dis@@ solving inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .
when the balance is prone to inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
in experiments , it has been found that a type of tolerance condu@@ ci@@ ve to mice is found in mice carrying a specific bacter@@ ium in its intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the constitu@@ ents of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet that is rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han fav@@ ours a more toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bow@@ el l@@ esi@@ on if the same system also affects people .
the post @-@ doctoral student Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan studied a kind of immune cell that fav@@ oured tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which had not been separated .
it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i that normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced DNA and six species of bacteria were found that were present in mice with the immune cells , but without them missing in mice .
mice were en@@ rolled in a sterile environment , so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they were given to L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria spread on the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i increased in a liquid and then passed small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant cells .
when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as an i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in mice fo@@ dder , the number of cells increased by about 50 percent , but when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that humans have the same tolerance @-@ promoting cells as mice , and most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
she said : &quot; the development of these cells is likely something we want to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the internal surface of the intest@@ ine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values can lead to an expansion of this population in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
Manchester United has signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , believes Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut on Wednesday evening against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria .
the € 40 million signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup starts on Tuesday , and impres@@ sively inv@@ aded the holder &apos;s role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira .
however , M@@ atic was excluded from the pre @-@ prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va stadium when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho began its start @-@ up XI for the beginning of the season .
the Independent expressed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still wished three further commitments , but he insist@@ ed that the club already had a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfill three of its four priority new commitments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get three out of four , I thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have taken great trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew off Seattle in Washington State Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state Mich@@ ig@@ an and drew in the form of a Dream@@ liner about the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the shape of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new grav@@ ure for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind is turning : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD boss , S &amp; D prime ministers always looked for Berlin with a certain concern .
merely no fire @-@ fire from the party headquarters , merely no head@@ wind from the federal government - was the most important wish of the voters .
since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally .
since then , the employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus are watching the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals .
what Martin Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with head@@ winds .
there were cr@@ ots .
and one after the other .
after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against co @-@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows once again : red @-@ green can simply not be reliable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said CD@@ U General Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , who has been surprised , over@@ threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
five months before the Sunday election , its red @-@ green coalition thus lost its one @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green Party managing director Michael Kell@@ ner has called on the rebel@@ li@@ ous low @-@ Saxon de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ ests to return their mandate .
the transition to CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elec@@ torate &apos;s will .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ ests must immediately return her mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal Managing Director and election campaign manager of the Green Party editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a SPD vot@@ er si@@ ghs , as on Friday morning the new job message reaches the party headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the CD@@ U without its own ruling majority after the emergence of the green de@@ pu@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the provisional highlight of a whole series of big and small crises in the SPD country associations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and nobody knows what comes next .
the mis@@ er began with the unexpected significant defeat in the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , more not , the comrades re@@ cal@@ med at that time .
after the state elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
it was then - and everything became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel carried the SPD in exchange , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te ble@@ w the party smoothly .
in the weeks afterwards , comrades , the comrades fought back again .
then , when they had just had new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit was from Hamburg .
and with him came the next heart@@ beat .
mayor Olaf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD chief , lost his Nim@@ bus that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because he did everything wrong in crisis communications after that , what you can do wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz fights for his political survival .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
due to the VW exhaust @-@ gas affair and its role in the supervisory board , the Minister @-@ President of Lower Saxony has been in criticism for a long time .
mi@@ ese survey values were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of this , Wei@@ l was trying to set accents in the covenant over the past few weeks .
the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin also did not remain hidden in the context of Martin Schulz .
they let him grant him , because they promised to stabili@@ ze the party by Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could happen .
in doing so , Wei@@ l is not guilty of the internal compul@@ sion of the Lower @-@ Saxon Gre@@ ens .
and Schulz is not at all .
at times , comrades try to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed to the Gre@@ ens , and above all to the apost@@ ate Par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians T@@ ests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and more democratic , as Ms. T@@ ests puts her own career interests above the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
not because of her person as a direct candidate , she was elected to the parliament because of her person as a direct candidate , but by the state list of the Lower Saxony &apos;s Gre@@ ens in parliament .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compl@@ ains of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elec@@ torate &apos;s willingness four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l the Prime Minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a top candidate to the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ ties counter@@ fei@@ ts the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for clari@@ fication of the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there have been further commitments of CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
subsi@@ dy for the center of the city III
those who want to renov@@ ate their house in the years can soon get support from the country .
in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of St@@ eg city development spoke in emotion on Wednesday .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ in@@ dler gave a review of what happened to now .
since 1991 it has been providing san@@ itation areas .
at that time , in the area of refur@@ bish@@ ment I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding .
in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; success @-@ project &quot; - it is important to promote interior development , not only to open up new areas of construction .
on April 4 , the government pres@@ idency of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a refur@@ bish@@ ment area III .
the funding amount amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which 500 000 euro came from the country , the rest of the community sensi@@ tivities .
how does a rehabilitation area develop ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; one will continue to investigate , as Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role in rehabil@@ itating in the planned territory .
if necessary , the territorial boundaries may also be postpon@@ ed .
the dock represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal state programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the program is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and extending the infrastructure .
the measures would be object @-@ related , i.e. per plot .
the refur@@ bish@@ ment area would eventually be defined as a statute .
the approval period for funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
until September this year , however , the survey would be carried out only once , in the context of which the parties involved in the rehabilitation area receive a questionnaire for filling out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in November or December , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stat@@ utes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shall be made possible in order to begin with the refur@@ bish@@ ment in the coming year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann then explained that each commune must carry out the said pre @-@ investigations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about evaluating and deciding on the urban planning gri@@ ev@@ ances when it is to be rehabil@@ itated and to what extent .
there is also a note in the basic register for the respective property .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again after feelings and make a picture of the situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Got@@ zel emphasized that the participation of the participants was a key success factor for the project .
this is why there will be questionn@@ aires , which will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where , among other things , it is about the structural condition and the renovation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ous@@ ehold and H@@ ousing Bran@@ ch &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; information about size , division and residents of a living room can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Operation Ar@@ ch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only to be filled when operated in the building &apos;s premises . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , to note that , Got@@ zel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , new construction measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ in@@ dler continued to emphas@@ ise that the distribution of funds according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; works - who comes first , grin@@ ds first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one cannot reserve funds for later &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Location II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ ors set themselves a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in house and car
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consult@@ ative an@@ aes@@ thesia in the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standard .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now installed at home as well as with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which starts when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost thousands of tax@@ pay@@ ers
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights the American manufacturing last month costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military &apos;s specifications , which were left to the TI@@ ME magazine , up to $ 24@@ ,000 .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the President is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
the Connec@@ tic@@ ut helicopter was shown next to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire@@ man of Wis@@ cons@@ in and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the White House &apos;s military office demanding the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or cargo , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with a high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his supervis@@ or , the Deputy Navy Commander for Aviation .
the message showed that on July 17th the helicopter arrived on the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so long until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed , due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew would be required for the return flight .
the original flight crew was during the event with the helicopter , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the plane .
from the recordings made available , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required .
the H@@ atch Act for@@ bi@@ ds federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
datas@@ ets indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could viol@@ ate the destination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds like you &apos;re locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; replied the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was described by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an impetus for reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but to claim their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
Tru@@ mp performed an investigation in February when the presidential plane was in front of the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of reports that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential plane through its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which shows products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deputy Prime Minister of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently perform training flights in the area around Washington and South La@@ wn to susp@@ end the U.S. president in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
when Tru@@ mp was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 practice land@@ ings in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted at the training requirement of the flight crew for the month , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said an official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; helicop@@ ters also flew 11 hours this day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers took charge of none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company was not involved in putting the helicopter out on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have budget awards for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the 2017 fiscal year , however , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour .
records of the unit recorded the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter are far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for ref@@ unds is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are contained in the annual resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a 2015 RA@@ ND study , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract .
at that time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things that are made in America this week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know Si@@ kor@@ sky and the State of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is of course appropriate to emphasize this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire truck .
in the White House , Tru@@ mp spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and jo@@ king with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW ne@@ uss before tri@@ cky task
top @-@ runner of the Second Tennis league takes place at the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
the TC blue @-@ white Ne@@ uss occurs tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
despite five games still flaw@@ less balance , the top @-@ runner of the Second Tennis League has retained the sense of reality .
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has any respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially on the back positions I find the team very good . &quot;
imports from the high north are mainly responsible for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to missions in the Davis Cup .
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a look at Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be difficult for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good deal of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high north is practical .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
at the moment of the Chall@@ enger Tournam@@ ent in the itali@@ an Bi@@ ella active Fren@@ ch@@ man is not part of the Bundes@@ liga game , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) playing in the Czech Liber@@ ec is at his first use this season .
yesterday &apos;s un@@ defeated chil@@ ene Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the White @-@ rus@@ sen An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
he should be in Kiel as well as Bo@@ tic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgi@@ ans Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two wins last Sunday against the club at the Al@@ ster Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could also move back to the team .
if it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hung@@ arians , who was still the number one of the Junior World Ranking in January 2016 , someone from the coach station fills the cad@@ re from Mari@@ us Z@@ ay .
how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tru@@ mp wasn &apos;t really happy when he put his signature on Wednesday evening under the law to tigh@@ ten sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress packed a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the response from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming the US initiative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the draft plans to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , investors of the O@@ MV home , which together with other European companies co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Ost@@ fri@@ en Nord Stream 2 , have been al@@ armed .
the dr@@ one is huge .
nevertheless , it is too early to estimate the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp would have to raise the sanctions by means of an executive order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has viewed which the Group could defend and which could really hurt it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Staff@@ el 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is the center of attention in the Hit@@ row of Net@@ fli@@ x

the three and four seasons were already confirmed by streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed up the latest vil@@ la@@ ins of the show .
with the third season DE@@ A focused its attention on the rich@@ est organisation of the drug traffi@@ cking in the world : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only with more state bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) command the Mexican association , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ ac@@ ote ) is located in New York .

role backwards : the city introduces 46 kitchen aids
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch table again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and assignment to the team .
in the municipal kinder@@ gar@@ tens , the clock is turned back .
on the 1st of September the town Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the urban day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) in its own reg@@ atta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare sector , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cook is still out of house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and supplies freshly cooked .
in the Kre@@ feld district , the city operates 46 kinder@@ gar@@ tens , in 44 children get a hot meal at lunch time .
in the last day of the year , 2,@@ 800 children sat at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , not only children who are cared for by 45 hours of the week are eating at the K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ er@@ ania . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour care when children stay until 2 p.m. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part time teachers from 1 September kitchen service : they heat up the delivered dishes , supplement them with salad , raw vegetables and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal individually , fill out the food , clean up , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees are firmly assigned to a cap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as seven units - decides about the circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen assistants are now part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; Pom@@ er@@ ania says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital to implement educational concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason too : healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children are supposed to help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen force to the team is sensible .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a known force in the cor@@ ita , a person familiar to them and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the aci@@ di@@ fication of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - until now also the task of the ch@@ ick forces - is done by special cleaning personnel in the future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance also has the charm that it has shown itself in the cost comparison between self @-@ control and foreign transfer for the city as the most economical one , it says from the press office .
and that , although 46 sub @-@ time forces are re@@ configured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so strong enough for about 750 people in the education sector , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on women &apos;s political role , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the Chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , acting leader of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women will be chann@@ elled in the provinces . three women candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elections can only be truly representative and credi@@ ble when women participate fully and be included in all parts of the election process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on April 5 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Taliban issued threats against a election process that coinci@@ ded with the transition from international combat operations to an advisory role .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year the elections for the first time will hand over the power peac@@ efully by a democr@@ atically elected government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ley said a strong role for women will reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women were registered by a total of 3.6 million registered voters .

G@@ MB concern about investment in Mc@@ Vi@@ tie Factory in Glasgow
a union wants to wi@@ den the long @-@ term commitment to production at their plant in Glasgow over the long @-@ term commitment to production in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company has kept silent about the future of investment in the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the work , which is produced alongside other products of Hob@@ by@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea Cookies .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner , Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experienced first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the head of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie called for &quot; concerns to say that financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines would not be pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ Organis@@ ator Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we are not able to gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross affects our members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers focus strongly on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important pillar for decent jobs in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , under the perspective of work@@ places , wage and prosperity , and against the background of Bre@@ x@@ it , rising living costs and the chronic production decline , the Eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday at T@@ oll@@ out@@ cross , we received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to it as we value the ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago we had regular meetings with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we are working in a highly competitive and uns@@ af@@ e business climate , constantly checking our business - and that applies to all our business units and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , particularly in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ out@@ cross as a production site . if our operations are changing at the site , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did PS@@ G Barcelona warn of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the side of La League may regret their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not leave N@@ ey@@ mar after having submitted a £ 18@@ 9 million offer to trigger his release clause , but have they warned Barcelona three years before the world record ?
the sensational approach has hal@@ ted the summer &apos;s transfer window , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous stamp , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds .
after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paid professional ath@@ lete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of over 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although there is a spring close to the Catal@@ ans board that the club has always done its best to take care of it since its arrival in San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G President against this prospect ?
when Manchester City expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players .
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect all clubs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to let one of our players sign in , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish association expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to go down under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .
sco@@ oter kno@@ cked off and damaged

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report reli@@ eves Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is what the author and historian Michael Hes@@ aman writes .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen station continues for discussions .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are the Church , &quot; said after publication in front of the German press agency , he received an ap@@ ology from the former Regensburg Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Cathedral conductor Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Bene@@ dict XVI .
it would greatly serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then false evaluation of the events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican paper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; however , critic@@ ised the fact that reporting on violence against the cathedral @-@ cats was measured with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; double standards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to the ass@@ aults in Regensburg no one doubt that it would have to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; degree of media manipulation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics committee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of the everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is also said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; we &apos;d love to go to the church and it &apos;s a frozen fres@@ hen . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that in her youth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have a completely normal ped@@ ago@@ gical agent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be done with friends , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would be unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports on the abuse incidents , pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ aman , who wrote the Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce book &quot; My Brother the Pope &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all that had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is written in the 440 @-@ page report that the lawyer Ulrich Weber commissioned by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s with high plau@@ sibility &quot; victims of transgres@@ sing 67 dom@@ es .
in the final report , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that by R. R. in many cases , forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied .
especially with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the pupils could also be more violent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to many other defend@@ ants , however , many victims over@@ estimated the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even associate positive memories with him despite violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the interview , E@@ zek@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal was reli@@ eved by the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in his opinion .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of non @-@ violence in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , &quot; is a contradic@@ tory picture of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s dome champion .
on the one hand , many disciples highlight his &quot; humanity . &quot;
on the other hand , it appears as a ch@@ oline and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which became tangible when a domain set brought no top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as a bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is not present at all .
he has just been dedicated to eight pages and he is plain@@ ly acqu@@ itted of any suspici@@ on of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pre @-@ school also took place outside of its sphere of influence .
it is possible to blame him at best , to experience it too late or to have taken first hints not seriously enough .
the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , on which it worked , was perceived by virtually all respon@@ dents as - literally - &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
thus also the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger provide an excellent testimony , describes it as &quot; warm hear@@ ted , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teachers who supplied the boys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y and &quot; always been surrounded by the grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ains about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and high emotion@@ ality , which also led to floo@@ ding .
the fact that he didn &apos;t just pop with chairs and threw the key@@ chain on the floor , but also par@@ ched ear @-@ cow@@ ards and too che@@ ek@@ y guys on the hair or ears , he has already admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ ts and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
it must be said , however , that such educational methods were widely distributed in the question@@ able period , the 1960s and 1970s , both in parents and in teachers .
do you also know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us , who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state Gymnasium .
compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , they are of course bag@@ at@@ elles .
you ask yourself if it doesn &apos;t have to do with his fame and his role as a brother of Bene@@ dict XVI , that many media just rus@@ hed on him .
many who have never understood him at the Bavarian Pope are still working di@@ lig@@ ently .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
in the media , a lot about the topic of abuse in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen was reported in connection with the report .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also involved in the final report any involvement or co @-@ operation with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claimed to have entrusted himself to the dome champion .
not even the parents were dedicated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a victim representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in the education of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims are silent .
if they did not even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral leader who , in a professional sense , would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students evaluate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to the abuse incidents ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a sought @-@ after student formulated it : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had timely re@@ ali@@ zations and could have been able to stop the offen@@ ders .
I think it ... also for really absurd to assume that all of them have opened to him ... Bu@@ ben more intru@@ sive or clearer or even more likely than compared to their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , tru@@ sting teachers etc .
that you talk to him about sex ... un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the report comes to the very clear outcome : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the students and / or their environment involved in the run @-@ up could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus free from any co @-@ ownership .
he cannot be accused of preventing or displaying it .
therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these conflic@@ ting crimes , as unfortunately , in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a lot of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; abuse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the media was to be read in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former dome champion Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking away &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this reproach ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed in the coverage of a giant gri@@ pper of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , right in the middle of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but exactly this is again an abuse of the report .
there is a clean separation : between the pres@@ ch@@ ool and the gymn@@ asi@@ um of the cathedral @-@ cats , between sexual abuse and violence , and , we say , other accus@@ ations .
in addition , the report treats incidents from the period since 1945 , so also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the choir director of the cathedral @-@ cats .
the whole aw@@ ful cri@@ tique @-@ ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases where boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were properly har@@ assed and painted , all of them took place at the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to prevail .
but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only got the boys face when they were already on the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on this , as most of the witnesses emphasize , the topic of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pre @-@ school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab@@ oo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one was only happy to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paradise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what was different from the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims over@@ estimated the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even associate positive memories with him despite violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this way , at the most , the accus@@ ation remains to have looked away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( so the witness ) wanted nothing to hear , and then only around 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently lose the ears before the conditions ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral gymn@@ asi@@ um , which even reproduced the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out that the pre @-@ school continues to practice the punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the danger of negative press releases , he advised urgent steps . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was , when testing sentences were banned in Bavaria too long ago .
before that , they found themselves in a legal grey area , as each one of us knows .
it was difficult for him to estimate that the suffer@@ ers might be over@@ done or dram@@ ati@@ zed and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded .
but one cannot say that he had always looked away .
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 the death penalty for schools was officially aboli@@ shed in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is asser@@ ted that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s educational standards for the time at that time .
how do you see that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pit@@ falls of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so the risk of assessing the past of today &apos;s moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess was right .
but this of course does not apply to sexual abuse , which was disgu@@ sting at all times , and not for what has been committed in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ vers@@ ity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , which goes far beyond the usual .
this is all quite aw@@ ful and I am glad that it will finally be worked up .
but at the same time , I must take protection against Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , for all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , so to draw ear cow@@ ards and hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then banned , he kept strictly to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what picture of his Regen@@ s@@ burger Zeit has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger played in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the topic prove to be a language of testing ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , i.e. Pope Bene@@ dict XVI , from his perspective , there the cathedral @-@ cats played only a minor role .
nevertheless , I don &apos;t know that he led a strict regi@@ ment there .
but this also has to be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without requiring unconditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world @-@ tran@@ g from the hitherto rather nation@@ ally known Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , the true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y alone , one does not even make a big voc@@ alist and before every success , regardless of which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of people do you have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks with her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and in addition , I have met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again and again as a wonderful , humor@@ ous , ben@@ evol@@ ent , deep @-@ believing and warm @-@ hear@@ ted person , of whom you can &apos;t imagine that even a fly could do something .
I regularly receive , like many former dom@@ es , 23 years after his Em@@ eri@@ tierung , regularly keep in touch with him , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family .
those who have not forgiven him until today are clearly in the minority .
today , most of his dom@@ es are grateful to him for enrich@@ ing their lives and telling them the world of music .
and that he is always a good , fa@@ ther@@ ly teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect@@ ful person to which they look today and which they almost worship .
and please , again , quite clearly : all that is accused of him are educational methods that were on the order of the day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can be glad that we have long over@@ came this time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is most unfair to make a man just because he is prominent and has a more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intention behind it , only too obvious .
for the report , which was just released , reli@@ eves him .
now the state of affairs would command a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace .
