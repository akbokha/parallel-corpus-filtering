<seg id="4">"" "" "" "farmers" "" "manage the former ground of farmers." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich supports exciting stories for days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's annoying if maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">This is known by everybody who had to get upset because the car Navi showed a green meadow instead of a strait road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria Atlases, an offer of geoportal Bavaria of the State Government, are anything but up-to-date - but it is very informative.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when comparing them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patch carpet that you can't recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the large picture postcard, more detailed maps, so-called prototype leaves, were incorporated into towns and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the Bavarian Authority, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army captain occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic survey of Bavaria, of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though the French troops withdrew from the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801, there were today's neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern map.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Elector Max IV Joseph drove the project forward, founded the" "" "Topographical Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bavarian surveying administration." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The premiere sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all others on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / present is most impressive in the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was spent 21 years after drawing up the map, thus in 1877, as a Munich suburb.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the rebellion of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first sight: when zooming appears a small-priced card with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten numbered flurries from the so-called "uranium," from which the land tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small plots there are no more farmers there today - but small farmers in the" "" "land in the sun" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is distinguished north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 the place of the Oktoberfest, was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen, in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name "at the Gasteig" or from the height "On the air" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße, one once locked people with insanity.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "in 1858 / 59 the Munich Circle" "" "Circle of Munich" "" "was created" "" "On the Auer Lüften" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden was head of the institution - the psychiatrist, who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and for example ended up dropping the so-called" "" "Irish" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he forbids the personnel to use violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum Haidhausen, who worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients was first place, later it was extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar (1905).</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006, Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost is one of Germany's largest psychiatrists.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people in Munich's Salesanum meet on the grounds of the former Auer Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with educational establishments.</seg>

<seg id="43">"" "in 2015, the children's house" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "was erected - in architectural reference to the original construction of the asylum system, which was destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed as" "" "Main Square" "" "around 1856, the Kaufinger street was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">In December 1944 the Allied bombings broke up many holes in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="47">A large remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a funeral chapel from the Middle Ages were once at the Marienhof, where these days will be the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn family line takes place.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promoting of Farbers has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which will enter into force by 28 August 2017, calls afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to take special attention while travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, race-based incidents occur in the entire state and be noted here," says the group opinion.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to win discrimination, as well as the enforcement authorities of the state, disproportionately aimed at minorities, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights that happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more gasoline during the trip and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points out a recent report from the Missouri General Attorney General, which shows that black motorists in the state are 75 percent more frequent than whites to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people need to be ready whether they bring chewing money or let the relatives know they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI hate crime report, which ranks the state in terms of the number of such violations of the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "the warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination." ""</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the States had passed immigration laws that commit local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which will contribute to further racial profiling.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately interest groups have used the measure as response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">The fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischbacher Weidecaun project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU members of the Bundestag Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have provided an image on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the Bautrenenhof of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fisherman's CDU-village association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann initially gave insights into his farm in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 milk cows and as many young animals provided and accommodated in five apartments Feriengäste.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Schwarzwaldmilch" "" "is for him the alternative-less marketer for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">Only Regionales come to the table of the Feriengäste.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "as he is also Chairman of the BLHV-Chairman of Fisherbach, he described the fence project as" "" "elementary important." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot profit on such steep faces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area care for a lot of work, much needs to be machined with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight with the conditions and with the topography," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertiliser, even if he does not conduct bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognized the importance of the fence project and is glad about the" "" "leader support" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoped that the reforestation of the surfaces could be pulled out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their operation," "" "said the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers are often criticised for their support</seg>
<seg id="84">Over the course of the fence, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The maintenance area is therefore 40 hectares, which must not be forestered until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of 71 500 Euro, half was promoted via leader, a quarter carried the municipality of Fischerbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers stayed 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"" "" "" "the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you do a really good job, without farmers and farmers it doesn't go." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "also for Peter Weiß stood firm:" "" "the best food is produced here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The state administration line (LPR) Baden-Württemberg facilitates the state-of-the-art promotion of soft saunas.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is to keep the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The prerequisite is the presence of a conveyor belt designated by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">Moreover, the enclosed area must not be smuggler (slope tendency more than 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the reforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the Fisherman's fence project 2018, the motion of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build close to 16 kilometres of fence, is currently underway.</seg>
<seg id="96">The disclosure area is 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump esses the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The surest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans estimate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos place in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta from CNN on the President's suggestions for drastic reduction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty Imitators would have liked him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he assumed its importance, and in particular the importance that it was attributed to, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "as Miller Acosta" "" "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world." ""</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "the poem you refer to is added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is objectively correct, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary resonance of the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weary, your poor, and your oppressed masses, who yearn to breathe freely, / the miserable waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "miserable waste" "" "was better seen on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not commit himself to literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trumps USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict over the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural struggle: it is indeed a conflict about America's importance.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they performed a highly political act.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical image.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people of the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The big scream Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone, but rather an early neo-conservatives that bring the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty continues.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch should not enlighten the way into the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh encountered here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is entirely and at all a matter of standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative action of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, eleventh, but hopeful people after long and often terrible voyages on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">In the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch shall not lighten the way, but ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m circuit, while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain.</seg>

<seg id="144">The Commonwealth Silver Medal winner, who will compete with the 400 m hurdles at their fifth world championships, says that it is "unbelievable" that 16 Scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>

<seg id="150">"" "the team captain says that they are" "" "hugely proud" "" "of the fact that many of their countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases also medals and finals will be mixed." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour anyway, but to know that my teammates voted for me and chose me, it makes it something very special for me," she added.</seg>

<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the newspapers struck him because of everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He knocked on the critique, sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in 1783, Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute we are led like sheep to slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogan employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union pledged to complain about it at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The Governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter reaction with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "" "" "it's just Facebook," "" "many people said." ""</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is astonishingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary head of heat.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his electors and defile his hair-free head to chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore the blocking of people who come to the Governor's side - which is a public forum that is officially designated and by employees paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokesperson, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hateful people who vibrate online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are just real people speaking with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, not a trolls.</seg>

<seg id="188">"" "what employees of the governor referred to as" "" "concentrated spam" "" "would probably call" "" "intercession" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in former times when we had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or to arrest demonstrators and to silence them.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what happens digitally.</seg>

<seg id="421">With the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3," Electro-Tausin-assa Elon Musk likes to give you a huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="422">In doing so, he has so far been suggesting that some of the clients have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.</seg>
<seg id="423">In addition to the constantly triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has for the first time betrayed a different, less brilliant figure: the cancellation of the new mass market model 3.</seg>
<seg id="424">In recent months, Musk frequently had more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery is just starting.</seg>
<seg id="425">Now Musk is dreaming: of the 518,000 pre-orders, 63.000 have already been withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is only a non-binding reservation.</seg>
<seg id="427">In case of cancellation, Tesla pays the 1000 Euro (in the US $1000 USD and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds) "Reservations Payment" completely.</seg>
<seg id="428">Currently 455,000 such non-binding reservations are available, spatialized musk in a telephone conference with analysts.</seg>
<seg id="429">However, the Tesla Group does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders could be a problem.</seg>
<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not at demand, but on the production side.</seg>
<seg id="431">Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="432">2018 - all models should be assembled - 500,000, one million by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk, 1,800 bookings are made per day.</seg>
<seg id="435">Who orders a "Model 3," may expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tesla manages to drive his brand new production lines, never tested in practice, without any major disruptions with maximum capacity utilization.</seg>

<seg id="440">One day after being accused of 15 states, Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, resigned his previous decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce the emissions of smog-causing pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of government environmental authorities than previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint lodged against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>

<seg id="445">Pruitt, who before his appointment by President Donald Trump, was prosecutor of Oklahoma, has long been a reliable opponent of strict environmental protection regulations.</seg>

<seg id="450">"" "" "" "under previous administrations, the EPA often did not meet deadlines for execution and then waited to be indicted by activist groups and others, and in an agreement set the date for execution," "" "said Pruitt, who complained more than a dozen times in his previous job."

<seg id="465">Tumours celebrates 750 years St. Hilarius Church</seg>
<seg id="466">750 years St. Hilarius church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade on Sunday 16 July at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius plant is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">The visitors of the Sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village have made friends and promoters of tumours to their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini stresses: "it is a unique village treasure."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilarius Chapel was first mentioned in the Württembergischen Urzubuch: Earl Hermann von Sulz "sold the mountain with the parish church on Tumlingen and the Vogtland" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the word of the deed, there was also a beautiful courtyard, which belonged to the church or patron, and not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt of 1858, it was next to the village and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the picture of tumors, the "mountain" of the third, the magnificent settlement nucleus of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps of the period around the year 1600 are underpinned by these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage arose from the early medieval self-Kyrgyz law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church, consecrated and occupied with a priest, continued to remain the owner of this church and could also inherit this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">This was the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The greater of the two shattered at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell rang out for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed over later in the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows were hammered and the belfry were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaking.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They removed the pulpit and the church mill, and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Eve in 1834, a storm split the church tower and half rushed.</seg>
<seg id="491">In order to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower still existing today remained a witness of the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are cultivating the Hilarius plant by the "Schaffhausen Rentals" as successor of Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">As organizers, the friends and promoters invite tumours on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth serenade on the old cemetery to the St. Hilarius Chapel.</seg>
<seg id="495">It is designed by the Combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Suburb Hartmut Romann is talking about the final word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is starting at 3: 30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="499">To the end of the serenade, a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="500">"" "" "" "enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest," "" "the organizers will make the fantastic view." ""</seg>
<seg id="501">The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organizers are hoping for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is important for tumors and horns.</seg>
<seg id="503">The friends and sponsors of Tumbagen feel particularly committed to home care, such as the Serenade organizer Walter Martini.</seg>

<seg id="505">"" "" "" "Boisheim undeth himself" "" "does not see any legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the councillor." ""</seg>

<seg id="507">It is unlawful.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that no wind turbines could have been approved at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheim Nette, as at the time in Viersen there was only a wind force concentration camp at the boundary to Schwalmtal.</seg>
<seg id="509">Within this concentration zone construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="510">"" "such zones are intended to prevent" "" "sparing" "" "of the landscape." ""</seg>
<seg id="511">Only a few days ago, the city of Viersen had decided to change the land use plan a second wind force zone in the Boisheimer Nette - but this had not been approved by the district government of Düsseldorf, because of a shortage.</seg>
<seg id="512">"" "" "" "due to the lack of planning legal requirements, the approval certificate granted is still unlawful and therefore also to be taken back," "" "said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of" Boisheim. "" "" "" "</seg>

<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a new subsidiary of the NEW, is planning on an area at the Boisheimer Nette, the construction of four 200-metre-high wind turbines.</seg>
<seg id="521">Last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, has closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, electricity needs of around 11 400 households can be covered - this corresponds to roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-class households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersen's city council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind park near Aachen, as well as a participation in a wind power plant in Übach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg.</seg>

<seg id="693">I realized that it is the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else with people working.</seg>

<seg id="760">Needless to say, not only Wilfried Sohmer thinks this addition.</seg>

<seg id="804">The question comes from St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber.</seg>
<seg id="805">The information on the boards should be supplemented by Internet.</seg>
<seg id="806">Therefore, a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of location.</seg>
<seg id="807">Accessibility is also a criterion.</seg>
<seg id="808">Later, the path to the star path is to be expanded by train.</seg>
<seg id="809">"on the starry trail, the viewer experience a lot of interesting facts, for example about the physics of the individual stars," the association explained.</seg>

<seg id="811">Also, in which constellation you can find a selected star and when it is best to see.</seg>
<seg id="812">Since 2014 the association operates in the mountain village of St. Andreasberg the highest situated observatory in Northern Germany.</seg>

<seg id="889">In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person "may be under 18 years old."</seg>
<seg id="890">The tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>

<seg id="908">The building end is scheduled for October and Leicht is sure that the timetable is complied with.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads through the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is a concrete arch bridge made of concrete, covered with red sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the other two bridges, it has now come to the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">To ensure stability and traffic safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="914">The two other bridges lead over Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are made of red sandstone.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10,60 meters long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach is now on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so-called bridging cap.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is a verge attachment that is also used as an operating path.</seg>
<seg id="919">A 2.20 metre wide bridge cap is to be used on the southern part of the bridge on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian path is to run.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special interest is that it is fabricated parts, a patent of the Schramberg company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented bridges.</seg>
<seg id="923">A special feeling of tact has required laying cables through the building in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">There is also a fibre-optic cable that many companies are connected to.</seg>
<seg id="925">Local residents were informed about the project prior to the work.</seg>
<seg id="926">Furthermore fish and crayfish had to be fished first.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the financial rules of football affect Neymars move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded spending of European football clubs will not bother Neymars world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will yet come for Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA because the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to forbid teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial fair play rules launched in 2011 by the UEFA mean that PSG has to prove at some point that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without great losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million $) to get the Brazilian out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can certainly make the money loose in order for Neymar to sign and bring him into a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the power-rich ruling family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs may spend a lot of money for the purchase of players, but must contribute with legitimate revenue sources that allow them to break even point in their business on football.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs, who had taken enormous debts in their pursuit of success, effectively cheated and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentration on the debt of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, the Roman Abramovich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">In the current three-year development period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses amounting to EUR 30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to deter him from excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"certainly FFP is not dead and we will definitely intensify the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a package, it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the sales revenue for the next five years can be reported in the amount of EUR 44.4 million in the financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit PSG along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the toughest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (then 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the teams of teams for the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 player.</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs trying to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Catalan company could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be considered a legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the PSA sponsorship of the Qatar Tourism Authority has been inflated.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar on payments of the Organisation Committee of the 2022 World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have argued that Neymar Cup ambassadors will be and such maneuvers could be easy to find for the UEFA regulatory authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to observe any attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars Transfer, announcing Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 generated a profit of more than €10 million with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1149">Accounts for the last financial year must still be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects Neymars arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signature.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players and tried to prevent Neymars removal by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"" "" "" "it is a clear case of" "" "financial doping" "" "with the club and the state," "" "said the President of the League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar's last owner of PSG." ""</seg>

<seg id="1194">And there is another crazy evil plot in which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is involved, who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-successful impression of Michael Ian Black).</seg>

<seg id="1199">The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as a director is to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, declined in 2014 from a big house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I was looking for something comparable to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-bedroom estate with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted storage and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimally.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, plenty of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my request, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to take advantage of the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over each other so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating an intermediate floor where you could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the task.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not just about building a simple platform, but to create the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with an additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper-light window from Retrouvius overlooks the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to let it work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the reflection feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all cutlery and glasses of joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can shut down the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a bit of engineering went inside," "" "explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is opposite so that when you push the door, it is very easy to glide." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"" "" "" "at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and make a calculation based on the size of the soil." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things that you touch and which help to create an emotional bond in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you do not fall into the electrical outlets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and increased square metercount of some standard into something completely amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you could decide to not leave it.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fight for a 500 million dollar real estate empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty in a dispute because of one of the largest real estate sites of Victorias worth more than $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul. he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their business capacity should be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to retire from family business since 2014, but a sharp debate on separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers bought 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the family purchased a business in Smith Street, Collingwood in 1973.</seg>
<seg id="1360">The Westco family founded jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for $85 million in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis's portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt. Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburb.</seg>
<seg id="1363">After an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - by Paul described as "chief operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about a third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court deed states that this means that Colin owns property of 316 million dollars and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a point of fact for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "the resolutions proposed by Colin have left him with what I held for the best objects," "" "he wrote in 2015 in a first affirmdavit." ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several failed negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The Brothers are now fighting for control over the existing business - from which Colin, as Paul claims to have excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but rejects Paul to manage some landings incompetent.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early Affidavit that was submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the argument.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian inheritance writes that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs rise in the event, with hundreds of pages with monkey items, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and by both parties held law firms.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De Lutis and her death husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who bought dairy-bars and delicatessen from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first jeans shop of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">"" "Colin says that he began" "" "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps new chief of staff plans to limit the media abstinence of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO records that the White House Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a regular course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the White House Chief of Staff, met at his first working day with executives, he represented a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House which he wanted to repair: bad information that came into the hands of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps's relationship with television ranges back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "when candidate Trump was angry about unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were too convincing," "" "said the former election campaign consultant Sam Nunberg in February against Politico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keeping Trumps Twitter habit under control, according to six ex-election officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter habit ever was "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Maybe these campaign officials know something we don't know about others - that Trumps Tweets without their interventions would have even more ignition material.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never learn about the tweets that Trump didn't send.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his associates managed to keep anger away from him a few times, their efforts were worth it.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently been able to prevent Trump controversies.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump Material that may promote their views of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - dealing with this story - reported in May about the predilection of advisors to the president for strategic reasons to supply doubtful information.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former Trump officials say Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he can find out where they come from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">This was exactly what happened at the end of February, when someone accused the President a printed copy of an article by Gottar.com, the website of the Internet provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh, "being the source behind a heap of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of harassment or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has expressed false accusations in the past and revoked it.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started asking employees about Walsh. "</seg>
<seg id="1413">"" "Goldsmith added that the then Chief of Staff, Reince Priebus and the General Secretary of the White House, Rob Porter," "" "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work out?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself to be more effective than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his counsellors are still striving for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unchanging factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1429">Travellers have parked their 20 caravan on a field outside of a prosperous road called Solihull, which is called the "Millionaire series."</seg>
<seg id="1430">They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters, after they were thrown out only in May, but without being deterred by a trench dug out by the Council, in order to prevent their seizures.</seg>

<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closing of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on April 13, 2014, approximately 30,000 nights per year were lost and also revenue from the tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the autumn of 2014, in view of the dramatic increase in numbers of refugees arriving in the administrative district, the hotel building was offered as a collective shelter for controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the Municipal Council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke at the time of serious interested people at the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should keep right.</seg>

<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special investigators Robert Mueller should have used a so-called Grand Jury after a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"" "the committee recorded work in recent weeks, wrote the" "" "Wall Street Journal" "" "calling for persons familiar with the matter." ""</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper saw the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified his investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1483">CNN reported that there are already the first invitations of the committee in connection with a meeting between Trumps's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence agencies have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time, purposefully interfering with the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examined whether there were agreements between Trumps election campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the focus of the investigations, several men shall stand, who acted as advisers to the Republicans in the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller also took more and more Trumps private and business environment under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"" "a few weeks ago, the" "" "Washington Post" "" "wrote that the Sonderermidler Trump had personally moved to the center and investigate the accusation that the president may have hindered the judiciary in the wake of the affair." ""</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jury is to examine the present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether it should be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jury votes are therefore also called accusations.</seg>
<seg id="1491">They are usually switched on when it comes to larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The process always takes place behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The body can also be turned on by the public prosecutor in order to charge persons for the operation under Eid.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to CNN, charges were issued which revolve around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were invited to a statement, called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In addition, they should provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Besides Trump Jr. also Trumps counsellors and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his former election campaign chief Paul Manafort were in conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the introduction shows that Mueller does not let himself be intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he wants to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">However, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will end up in order to decide on the rise of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the establishment of the Greens is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for the concern of President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, the president took a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray Russia's affairs as a campaign of his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "Russia's history is a total invention," "" "said Trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="1503">"" "the subject give the democrats a way to" "" "feel good, because they have nothing else they can talk about." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1505">But this work usually works in secret, he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="1506">"" "the White House advocates any measures that accelerated the work of the agent in a" "" "fair" "" "way." ""</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI boss James Comey has said three times that not against the President.</seg>
<seg id="1508">You have no reason to assume that something has changed, it was stated in the declaration.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller was only used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"" "" "" "because of this raging accusations, accusations against Trump have been loud, he did not want to hinder the judiciary." ""</seg>
<seg id="1511">In June, Comey said in front of a Senate Committee, Trump urged him to set up investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">According to U.S. media, the White House collected material against the special agent and his collaborators.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation about whether Trump Mueller wanted to release.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an Independent Special Representative of the Congress, such as the Watergate affair concerning the later retired President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on the presidency of the President of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>

<seg id="1523">There is no danger for people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">It is unclear to what extent climate change has played a role in the abortion of the iceberg.</seg>
<seg id="1525">However, for about 30 years there have been a series of unusual breakthroughs of ice cuddle in the region, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this can be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus had so far been a part of the Larsen-C-Shelf.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Shelf swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Shelf is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">To the north of this horseshoe, the balance of waxing and abrupt was disturbed a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete coward is crumbling there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say that also the Larsen-C Shelf is in danger, because the front edge has never been as far back as it is currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice plate is under voltage and can be discarded if a piece break at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of ice cream and iceberg does not increase sea level, as they float on the water and ice as much water as it flows after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase sea level, but only in a small measure, the British research project writes to the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen-C Schelfin is the fourth largest reserve of Antarctica with nearly 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">It breaks off on a regular basis.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural happening and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the iceplate is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the broadest retreat since the beginning of the record," "" "he also confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">"" "among scientists it was disputed whether the Larsen-C Schelfeis would now grow back or go back over the long term and possibly collapsed, his colleague Adrian Luckman said," "" "Our models say it will be less stable." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Although these researchers did not decline this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many ice-cudders of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of the Antarctic extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The decrease in temperature has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed up around three degrees in the last 50 years and thus counters the areas in which the temperature is fastest growing.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants property tariff at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vacant positions, the CDU, from the employers' association, demands to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Just before the summer break, 41 new jobs have been swept through the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now 17 trainees have their first working day.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The apprenticeships in the circle are obviously very sought after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Some 620 applications were registered for the places to be awarded this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, the circle is still lacking in order to be able to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">At present, there are still 50 unoccupied spots in the district of Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and UWG and counter the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "the management should work out a concept for recruitment and personnel development according to the wishes of the parties." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is to not only cover short-term demands on skilled workers, but to counteract the future-oriented application shortages.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should orientate itself internally and externally, show concrete measures for lateral entrants and include a training offensive, call for CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "the speech is of a regular" "" "competition of public employers" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1569">"" "" "" "the highest time for action therefore, so that no more places remain unoccupied." ""</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter Volk, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the common motion with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He did not care for a big surprise already in the Cretan day when he publicly challenged the personnel costs and the other parties were amazed.</seg>

<seg id="1574">In doing so, the CDU tries to pay the employees and officials better than it actually foresees the public service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money is only available when you change to a higher level that is oriented towards professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more over the past few years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago, new premises had to be set up, in which employees care about the provisions of the new prostitution protection law.</seg>

<seg id="1582">Minnitis's warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German relief organisation 'Jugend recover' because their crew had worked effectively with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year now, refused to express themselves with detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "for us, the saving of human life is our top priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "" "said the organization in a statement on the social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "" "" "we can only assess all accusations that are being raised until we have collected all the information and assess the situation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had supervised the boat from 'Jugend recover', the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is presumed that its crew takes on board boat migrants, which are supplied to them directly by human traffickers, and that the smugglers can go down so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting reportedly took place only 1.3 miles in front of the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's acts, whose contents were published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The crew is suspected of being overlooked by the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue missions in the humanitarian grounds and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa must have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have previously agreed to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>

<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome addition.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour led to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim during hot summer temperatures.</seg>
<seg id="1603">It was followed by lookout points, partly on towers of which one could see far above the Palatinate Forest and the upstream layers.</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between there were always longer ascents, for the long trials rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and to the folk festival Wurstmarkt.</seg>

<seg id="1615">This has also been recognized by the first federal states of Germany who are increasingly engaged in this field.</seg>
<seg id="1616">The beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and recently VfB Stuttgart, who founded an E-Sport-department in mid-July and took two pros for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract.</seg>

<seg id="1625">With prominent e-sportsmen under contract, one could be more often present on these markets online more often than ever to send the German government to Asia once a year.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>

<seg id="1629">And in the Asian Games, E-Sport is already part of the official program.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it really a kind of sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the performance is certainly getting used to.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobbing has also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the German Sport University in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport, because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical responses that can also be found in classical sports - for example increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">In addition, it requires cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding and a fast reaction.</seg>

<seg id="1755">European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions regulations.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are regarded as carcinogens and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The cost of car manufacturers to install machinery to neutralize the exhaust gas emissions from diesel vehicles also increases what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.</seg>

<seg id="1782">"the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he said once.</seg>
<seg id="1783">After stops in Lima, New York and Paris, the breakthrough came at the end of the sixties: with the publication of his cartoons in Paris Match and then in the "Star" and other leading magazines around the world.</seg>

<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and insect-transferring insects, which are causing great headaches to scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered, because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change that has caused much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has an impact on the life of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small Zikade, a micro-bacterium that transfers dwarf gracads, and with very dry weather there are many of them. "</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the Weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on recent mayhem in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about safety.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children to the office which were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts wrote three words on a table on the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and abdominal feelings reach.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the government's payroll or cartels, a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest from violence, and while the bodies accumulate throughout the country, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are facing attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there were at least seven deaths in seven states.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter are her editors and her inspirer of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep, although his presence is everywhere - a big photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez wear t-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a special prosecutor's office was established in 2010 in order to edit the cases of journalists, the Committee for the Protection of Journalists initiated only two criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murders, which are linked to drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the murderers of journalists are rarely placed in court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are uncomforting and although the terrain is now more treacherous.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know why we are suspicious of everyone." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15 May Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to go a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "twelve river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter went away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around in Culiacan freely.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest in the past year and delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, as rival groups are struggling here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It does not matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many houses for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "peace" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damascica Lopez, a leader of one of the rival trusts in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the children, presumed gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second fault was to not force Valdez to leave the country for his own security after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced journalist for Noroeste in 2003 when he cooperated with five colleagues for the founding of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollar holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the drug poison problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">With time, the newspaper earned a reputation as a result of courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters cherished it to be able to publish hard-fitting investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize" for her coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursuit of Mexican drug history wherever she led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered that he was scared.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to continue living," "" "he said at the time of the CPJ award." ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life, "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV.</seg>

<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked," "" "What have you done in the face of so many dead... why didn't you say what went ahead?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team missed Valdez, the fun bird, who was able to curse like a dockworker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">"" "now they ask," "" "Was his love for routine be his destruction?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to best deal with her work and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like to deal with their wives, their children, their clean stores, their secret runways" "" "to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"" "" "" "these things were not allowed," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust your own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">"" "the anger is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that" "" "smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happens with Javier." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the staff of Riodoce met for safety training, no mobile phones were allowed. days earlier it became known that Spyware, sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodosia in a four-storey building in a mid-size district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves if these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police officers, who are not trustworthy of the governor themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters have gone to the mountain landscape where drug gangs are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodosia has focused on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the former famous boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposure to the state expenditures focusing on the home town of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the office of the prosecutor, performing a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the reigning Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled almost the whole century all the political planes.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of corruption of high calibre.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier, the readers of Valdez had considered the best informed source of kidnapping.</seg>

<seg id="1886">Valdez's office became a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they had never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped up a few signs and the next morning he went to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA testing that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">"" "in the whole country, journalists have become louder by writing in organized protests" "" "SOS Press" "" "on footpaths and constructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and let them kill because they said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since asked her to be re-classified by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime, the government officials and an equal society. "</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his latest book "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs but also on orders of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a ceiling with organised crime.</seg>

<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivorous is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk when he was on 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, dug.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something that seemed out of the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) heavy earth clumping.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it has slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this herbivorous, although it is covered with armor and resembles a changing tank, probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily-armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counterfeit, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed it to get better into its surroundings and to soften its enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by major dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurier family made headlines in May and is now in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and it was called Borealopelta Markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours with it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The remarkable preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the contershading, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the conteration is common, the results are surprising as the size of the Borealopelta far exceeds the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It suggests that the dinosaur was driven by enough pressure by carnivorous dinosaurs that the evolution favoured the disguise of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use contershading - think of roe deer, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable than loot, indicating that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"" "" "" "strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the chalk have to have been," "" "said Brown." ""</seg>

<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to examine the animal in evidence of his life, including his preserved intestines, in order to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, fell into a river and driven out into the sea, where he sank to the seabed on the back.</seg>

<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the ocean and mumified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he was on 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, dug.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the guarded dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures on average were about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that protruded from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armoured herbivorous was swept through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater hull of the dinosaur kept its armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are so good that the stallions are still covering holly armoured plates along the dinosaur.</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is so 'rare as a winning in the lottery.</seg>

<seg id="2041">It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience that exists from the point of view of the people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell with her daughter, who carried a flower-dress and a suitable crown, went to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation that they had innumerable times before this morning "about the black experience and the black condition."</seg>

<seg id="2051">The first stop, when they arrived in Ferguson, was on the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police station, which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-accusation of Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>

<seg id="2055">"my activism changed completely after 9 August," she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>

<seg id="2060">"" "Ferrell asked a question:" "" "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt occupants.</seg>

<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the Movement, who after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin, in 2012 marked the film "BlackLivesMatter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.</seg>

<seg id="2094">While the proponents build a gallery attract more customers, from which the rest of the shops will benefit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition: the gallery is planned exactly on the premises where the farmers market hall is located, in which 13 direct markets offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the beginning of the construction work will be finished.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces can be seen - white, black and brown, almost indistinguishable - hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupanks and haircuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year sentence after publicly traded diplomatic notifications about the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on 2nd August is called A Becoming resemblance (A matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline has united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and dissident dissident, whose conviction of Barack Obama was transformed when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Through the algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted by Manning, Dewey-Hagborg originated from the 30 portraits, as someone with these genomic data could look like, a sharp, albeit a somewhat intellectual commentary, not only to the forms of DNA-data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but had already talked openly about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced to 20 counts in 2013, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white selfie, in which Manning deliberately sits on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum blonde wig - associated with her.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came just from the great success of their 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum by extracting DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be visited at that time and she couldn't be photographed, so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated Muse became unequal briphews, who replaced several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"" "they even created a comic" "" "Suppressed Images" "" "illustrated by Shoah Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the President of Chelsea would transform his judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally." ""</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama actually was only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas would demand was a welcome type of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is something deep and strong now at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump carries out a war against informants from the government camp and against Transgender-forces to find new, tweetable ways to keep the rigid divisions that he was supposed to fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning with her oversized signature (the "i" in her surname is marked with a heart) an end of "automatic fragmentation, based on gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandler of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of 200 letters (or nucleotides after the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist), how amazing, at least in biological terms, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take away is that our genome doesn't care who we are and how openly genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjectively they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works from 2007, Spurious Memories, also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the above mentioned comic novel.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning as she emerges with a hands-free telephony in the hand from the disciplinary barracks of the United States like King Kong.</seg>

<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software, which has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to address surveys, offer special groups and demographic groups, to offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases, whistleblowers allow to circumvent the C-Suite managers and directly contact the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where is the Fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said that they have a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint won.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low approval results - so you can rebounce why.</seg>

<seg id="2215">For start-ups such as Glint, this wish is an overview of a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>

<seg id="2224">If a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethical, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, Convercent has used for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">In the past, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or e-mail for the headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby TUESDAYS General Counsel who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, as the company uses Convercent, problems previously identified by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states were identified and addressed faster than discrimination, harassment, or unfair internships.</seg>

<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance that will support Venture Capital investors who supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Cent received $10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total amount of capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glittering has secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising, given the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees are more likely to expect from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">High salaries and interesting projects are only possible in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley.</seg>

<seg id="2243">Investors reach returns when their portfolio companies operate well. companies run well when employees are committed and committed.</seg>
<seg id="2244">When the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment to employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">Data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the administrator of a company does not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have a expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the changes don't come fast enough or not at all, this can breed disappointments and demotivate employees.</seg>

<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the lush River Valley in Kent and now has become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a cosmopolitan Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>

<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found emotionally emotional.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I just reacted to the thumb print on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700" s that worked for the Jacobins, "he says.</seg>

<seg id="2299">And letters always smell as smoke, because at that time a fire was kindled because of the light.</seg>

<seg id="2302">For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived for almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have overrated my welcome greeting") all this seems too nice to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He walked through the grounds and ruins of the old castle, and spoke with landscape nurses, gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">"" "then at night he drank" "" "Whiskey" "" "and started writing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust received full access only in 2006, when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>

<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse themselves in English history, among them 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"" "" "" "there is a record of a rebellion in 1380 in the castle, in this book entitled 'Knife Families of Kent and Sussex'," "" "says Rhodes." ""</seg>

<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell is portrayed in the 18th century, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was excavated).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes's favorite family of Scotney: "the gentlemen seemed to be quite a crook, always making debts and spending money on things they couldn't afford.</seg>

<seg id="2348">More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, who sees Erdogan as the wire-puller of the attempted putsch.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should worry</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it can't become even more crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots arrives.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a great deal.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University Sheffield and Co-Founder of the FRR, we must start taking their Ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of nipple and type of fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we will see them much more frequently," said Mr. Sharkey when he released his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpuppen have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"" "the user can also" "" "adapt" "" "his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails." ""</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but it becomes even more disturbing since many robots have" "" "personalities" "" "who would have made a stepford woman progressive." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern scrappers have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot, for example, enables its users to adapt their robots to properties that they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion, with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible," enthuses the website of True Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she also has her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, fixed on conversation or she can be" "" "in mood" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female qualities, the allusions to rape if you take a step on Frigid (i.e. here: reluctant) Farrah, troubled one most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy is compatible with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" "" "says it on the website." ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their formation and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men naturally won't hold any sex-robots, and while the FRR notes their growing popularity, they still remain on the verge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what transpires from the boundary zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlapping that these highly developed sex robots are emerging in a time where women's rights are threatened all over the world, in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted to have women sexually assaulted.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrible aspect of the TV series' The Hand maid's Tale '(' The report of the maid ') is not the graphic images, the devoured body and the stochastic eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The aim behind these sex robots is to produce a physical similarity to actual women as realistically as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel humane that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, when it comes to their" "" "personalities" "", "the robots are not real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companions or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or background history, nothing that hinders independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are fake slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the Redemption of 2017: maid Girl</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trump great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of the common sense of man</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a trump of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized US voters have also split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving there were newspapers with advice in the USA about how to deal with the horror of Trump choosing relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">"" "" "" "we're all pretending to let our filter bags burst." ""</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of bringing families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-facing poet who lives in Chicago and has long occupied with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful impact.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone knows it, including the republican relationship with which they fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and completely strange on the same page.</seg>
<seg id="2433">For the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it is in a further context that this also entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"" "when we speak of" "" "normalization" "" "and Trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that one day his bibs will no longer meet us." ""</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is, however, an even more terrifying long-term scenario in which Trump republicans normalize the right wing, which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Today I find myself falling from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urcomical version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how to see his tax return) - both in fact occur as a very mild criminal offence compared to Trump.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump enters, the next candidate of the Republicans must be only spiritually healthy in order to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the New York Parks Department, and the top three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need a caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are growled and the animals turn out to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate-perming music imparts this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines are too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not completely over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the topics pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a large roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">However, the Central Park-carousel is still a strange magic experience, as two two-year-old, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40-year-old can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have scored the carousel I would have given him the full score, but fortunately nobody asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what actually should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store stood apologizing, while I was tired of the experience to hand her my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital</seg>

<seg id="2451">Last year he was hospitalized due to the treatment of cuts to his wrists, which he suffered according to a case in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Pistorius was sentenced to a first death sentence due to murder after an appeal by the prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day, by firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a nocturnal intruder hiding in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors have announced their intention, this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius Appell, from which they say that it is too lenient.</seg>
<seg id="2456">The National Criminal Investigation Department said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal can be heard this year.</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius is in danger that his sentence will be increased to 15 years when the prosecutors are successful.</seg>

<seg id="2536">The job is already written out - but suitable candidates are rare.</seg>

<seg id="2540">At the same time, it is surprising that no application has been submitted to the requirements profile until now.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the next possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">This means that - in compliance with the regular periods of notice - there is still enough time for a familiarization.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach works as a sub-legal authority for the administrative community, the applicant must point out corresponding agreements.</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study asserts exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition affecting around 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurring or bloody diarrhoea, loss of weight and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While sufferers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps develop immune cells that promote a tolerant colon.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The conductive researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the gut patrol to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not penetrate into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are capable of dissolving inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">When the balance is prone to inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments, it has been found that a type of tolerance conducive to mice is found in mice carrying a specific bacterium in its intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the constituents of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet that is rich in tryptophan favours a more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel lesion if the same system also affects people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral student Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a kind of immune cell that favoured tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which had not been separated.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiome of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were sequenced DNA and six species of bacteria were found that were present in mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were enrolled in a sterile environment, so that an intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they were given to L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria spread on the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri increased in a liquid and then passed small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as an idol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice fodder, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and most of us L. reuteri protect in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said: "the development of these cells is likely something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the internal surface of the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2603">"" "potentially high tryptophan values can lead to an expansion of this population in the presence of L. reuteri." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2672">Those who want to renovate their house in the years can soon get support from the country.</seg>
<seg id="2673">In addition, Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of Steg city development spoke in emotion on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="2674">At the beginning of the information event Schindler gave a review of what happened to now.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Since 1991 it has been providing sanitation areas.</seg>
<seg id="2676">At that time, in the area of refurbishment I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler the previous renovations are a "success-project" - it is important to promote interior development, not only to open up new areas of construction.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, the government presidency of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a refurbishment area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The funding amount amounts to 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 euro came from the country, the rest of the community sensitivities.</seg>

<seg id="2684">If necessary, the territorial boundaries may also be postponed.</seg>
<seg id="2685">The dock represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"" "Keller presented the contents of the federal state programme" "" "Social City" "", "where the renovations would then be carried out." ""</seg>
<seg id="2687">The core of the program is the revitalisation of inner cities, improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and extending the infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="2688">The measures would be object-related, i.e. per plot.</seg>
<seg id="2689">The refurbishment area would eventually be defined as a statute.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The approval period for funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Until September this year, however, the survey would be carried out only once, in the context of which the parties involved in the rehabilitation area receive a questionnaire for filling out.</seg>

<seg id="2699">"" "the yellow questionnaire is the" "" "building and property sheet" "", "where, among other things, it is about the structural condition and the renovation." ""</seg>

<seg id="2702">However, to note that, Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding.</seg>
<seg id="2703">In addition, new construction measures are not eligible.</seg>

<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the President is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed, due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew would be required for the return flight.</seg>

<seg id="2743">HMX-1 does not have budget awards for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.</seg>

<seg id="2745">Records of the unit recorded the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter are far below this rate.</seg>

<seg id="2864">The side of La League may regret their interest in Marco Verratti</seg>
<seg id="2865">Paris Saint-Germain will not leave Neymar after having submitted a £189 million offer to trigger his release clause, but have they warned Barcelona three years before the world record?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has halted the summer's transfer window, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous stamp, with Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds.</seg>
<seg id="2867">After finishing, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest-paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers wages of over 500,000 GBP per week.</seg>
<seg id="2868">Barcelona is furious about the way Neymar has forced his way out, although there is a spring close to the Catalans board that the club has always done its best to take care of it since its arrival in Santos in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2869">But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG President against this prospect?</seg>
<seg id="2870">When Manchester City expressed interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of PSG's best players.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the misuse cases relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is what the author and historian Michael Hesaman writes.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen station continues for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are the Church," said after publication in front of the German press agency, he received an apology from the former Regensburg Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Cathedral conductor Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would greatly serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their then false evaluation of the events.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican paper" "" "Osservatore Romano" "", "however, criticised the fact that reporting on violence against the cathedral-cats was measured with" "" "double standards" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">"" "with regard to the assaults in Regensburg no one doubt that it would have to be" "" "shameful and shameful acts" "", "which would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the" "" "degree of media manipulation" "", "says the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics committee." ""</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of the everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal," "" "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis also said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "we'd love to go to the church and it's a frozen freshen."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "she also pointed out that in her youth," "" "Have a completely normal pedagogical agent" "", "" "" "to be done with friends, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">It would be unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports on the abuse incidents, pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesaman, who wrote the Remembrance book "My Brother the Pope" with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I must take care of Georg Ratzinger," "" "says Hesemann," "" "for all that had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is written in the 440-page report that the lawyer Ulrich Weber commissioned by the Bistum Regensburg with the Enlightenment?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s with high plausibility "victims of transgressing 67 domes.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can be said that by R. R. in many cases, forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the pupils could also be more violent.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"" "in contrast to many other defendants, however, many victims overestimated the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even associate positive memories with him despite violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Ezekemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal was relieved by the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of non-violence in the Regensburger Domspatzen," is a contradictory picture of Georg Ratzinger's dome champion.</seg>
<seg id="2910">On the one hand, many disciples highlight his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, it appears as a choline and perfectionist, which became tangible when a domain set brought no top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as a biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is not present at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just been dedicated to eight pages and he is plainly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the pre-school also took place outside of its sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">It is possible to blame him at best, to experience it too late or to have taken first hints not seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The Domspatzengymnasium, on which it worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents as - literally - "salvation," "heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">Thus also the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger provide an excellent testimony, describes it as "warm hearted," "sincere," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as extremely good-natured teachers who supplied the boys regularly with cakes, biscuits and candy and "always been surrounded by the grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and high emotionality, which also led to flooding.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he didn't just pop with chairs and threw the keychain on the floor, but also parched ear-cowards and too cheeky guys on the hair or ears, he has already admitted years ago, deeply regrets and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">It must be said, however, that such educational methods were widely distributed in the questionable period, the 1960s and 1970s, both in parents and in teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us, who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state Gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually happening in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the preschool, they are of course bagatelles.</seg>
<seg id="2926">You ask yourself if it doesn't have to do with his fame and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media just rushed on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Many who have never understood him at the Bavarian Pope are still working diligently.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, a lot about the topic of abuse in the Regensburger Domspatzen was reported in connection with the report.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger also involved in the final report any involvement or co-operation with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claimed to have entrusted himself to the dome champion.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I have never dared to talk to my father or my mother," "" "said a victim representative for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in the education of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral leader who, in a professional sense, would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen students evaluate Ratzinger's role in regard to the abuse incidents?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a sought-after student formulated it: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had timely realizations and could have been able to stop the offenders.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... also for really absurd to assume that all of them have opened to him... Buben more intrusive or clearer or even more likely than compared to their parents, dormitory leaders, trusting teachers etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk to him about sex... unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus the report comes to the very clear outcome:" "" "that the students and / or their environment involved in the run-up could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is thus free from any co-ownership.</seg>
<seg id="2943">He cannot be accused of preventing or displaying it.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these conflicting crimes, as unfortunately, in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "a lot of" "" "abuse" "" "in the media was to be read in the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former dome champion Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "" "looking away" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this reproach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed in the coverage of a giant gripper of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, right in the middle of Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But exactly this is again an abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is a clean separation: between the preschool and the gymnasium of the cathedral-cats, between sexual abuse and violence, and, we say, other accusations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report treats incidents from the period since 1945, so also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir director of the cathedral-cats.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole awful critique-pedagogy, the cases where boys of sadistic teachers were properly harassed and painted, all of them took place at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to prevail.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got the boys face when they were already on the gymnasium gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "on this, as most of the witnesses emphasize, the topic of" "" "pre-school" "" "taboo." ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">"" "one was only happy to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even" "" "paradise" "" "states." ""</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the gymnasium gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic force.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" "" "many victims overestimated the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even associate positive memories with him despite violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">This way, at the most, the accusation remains to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) wanted nothing to hear, and then only around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently lose the ears before the conditions?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral gymnasium, which even reproduced the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out that the pre-school continues to practice the punishment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">"" "" "" "in view of the danger of negative press releases, he advised urgent steps." ""</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was, when testing sentences were banned in Bavaria too long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they found themselves in a legal grey area, as each one of us knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to estimate that the sufferers might be overdone or dramatized and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one cannot say that he had always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the death penalty for schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis asserted that it was unfair to apply today's educational standards for the time at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael Hesemann: we are talking about the" "" "pitfalls of anachronism" "", "so the risk of assessing the past of today's moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess was right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this of course does not apply to sexual abuse, which was disgusting at all times, and not for what has been committed in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond the usual.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all quite awful and I am glad that it will finally be worked up.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time, I must take protection against Georg Ratzinger, for all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishment, so to draw ear cowards and hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then banned, he kept strictly to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "what picture of his Regensburger Zeit has Georg Ratzinger played in the talks with you for the book" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the topic prove to be a language of testing?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, i.e. Pope Benedict XVI, from his perspective, there the cathedral-cats played only a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I don't know that he led a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this also has to be said: without this perfectionism, without requiring unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world-trang from the hitherto rather nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen, the true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candy alone, one does not even make a big vocalist and before every success, regardless of which area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people do you have experienced Georg Ratzinger during the talks with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and in addition, I have met Georg Ratzinger very well and again and again as a wonderful, humorous, benevolent, deep-believing and warm-hearted person, of whom you can't imagine that even a fly could do something.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly receive, like many former domes, 23 years after his Emeritierung, regularly keep in touch with him, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who have not forgiven him until today are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Today, most of his domes are grateful to him for enriching their lives and telling them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respectful person to which they look today and which they almost worship.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, again, quite clearly: all that is accused of him are educational methods that were on the order of the day.</seg>
<seg id="2994">"" "" "" "we can be glad that we have long overcame this time." ""</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is most unfair to make a man just because he is prominent and has a more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intention behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report, which was just released, relieves him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the state of affairs would command a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace.</seg>
