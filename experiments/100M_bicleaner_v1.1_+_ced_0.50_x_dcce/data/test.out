a 28 @-@ year @-@ old cook who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in a local shopping mall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said that he could not imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally it went uphill again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cor@@ p@@ se found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 year old Frank Gal@@ icia from San Francisco , distributed the medical department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investigations are underway .
the brother of the victim , Louis Gal@@ icia , told the ABS station K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , caught his dream job as a cook at S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ gh@@ ters Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ gh@@ ters said that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about his death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are at this difficult time at Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gal@@ icia admitted that Frank initially lived in Host@@ els , but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , &quot; shared Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO .
Louis Gal@@ icia said that he could not imagine anyone who would hurt his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a big heart .
connecting his way with his family was to bring us always something to prepare for dinner , &quot; said Louis Gal@@ icia .
he never wanted to participate in any kind of confrontation .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the stream .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond that lit every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information about the case will be asked to call the SF@@ B @-@ phone number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
the Hollywood star has now clearly made it clear in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will always be stuck in drawers or past@@ ed from the outside label , which have little to do with me and reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself don &apos;t have the desire to be always perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , these things are rather sn@@ u@@ ff to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as explained in the current Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most of all , the act@@ ress sp@@ ends her time at home , vor@@ m television with a punch and Mexican food , it &apos;s called in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she brings the question about the desire for children : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play &quot; anim@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film is running on 25th August .
Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger visited with some colleagues a bit of change with a ride on the beach .
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
Chi@@ o : &quot; golden sport pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes , the horses remembered their holiday , they hun@@ ted in quick gal@@ lo@@ p home to the feed @-@ trou@@ ghs .
one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and so the riding career ended again .
Saturday was Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament victories - again in the vicinity of horses .
he let his family run over the grounds of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he didn &apos;t even bo@@ ther for photo@@ purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and therefore also at the CH@@ IO .
the reason was absolutely convincing .
the German sports aid presented the Golden Sports Pyr@@ amid to the man from An@@ hausen on a small gala .
there is no lack of awards to the symp@@ a@@ thetic ath@@ lete .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silber@@ nes lau@@ rel leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already rebu@@ ked him .
long is the 18th pri@@ z@@ ew@@ inner of the sports pyramid .
in Aachen he met the first lau@@ re@@ ate Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting success but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger has been promoting young talents .
and so he also announced the prize money of 25,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US master winner was admitted to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame des deutschen Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ tigh@@ ten , the F@@ echter Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the ski@@ pper Al@@ win Sch@@ ock@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um the Hand@@ book of Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous society went to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion , where the Lav@@ azza Award was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tru@@ mp@@ s Economic Policy Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing the T@@ TP trade agreement - they want both Clinton and Tru@@ mp .
the two US pres@@ idency , however , are un@@ one in tax and energy policy , as well as in a fundamental question .
the difference in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and H@@ illary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosophical difference .
of the role of the state .
Tru@@ mp is reluc@@ tant to keep the economy small and warns about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wants to lev@@ y the economy to death and regulate it to death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , claiming Tru@@ mp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will mas@@ sively drive regulation , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has certain tasks to fulfill , it has deprived opportunities and needs money .
therefore , taxes would be increased for the rich , they say .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure .
in that need to be invested , Tru@@ mp and Clinton say almost word @-@ like .
the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II .
state investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical wing of the Republi@@ can party .
so on Tru@@ mp there could be internal discussion .
the differences in energy and climate policy are more evident .
Tru@@ mp plans to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the USA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oil extraction should also be possible in previously protected areas , he wants to termin@@ ate the Paris climate agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , wants to extend and demand renewable energies with its investment programme : &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ ac@@ fic trade agreement , do not want to sign both .
at the same time , both of them do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade , but simply better protect American jobs .
they should also be paid better , requires about Clinton .
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a hunger wage .
he wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tru@@ mp does in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be fixed , then he says he must not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of both camps .
on the one hand , Tru@@ mp , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth .
his critics are suggest@@ ing that the budget deficit would only be greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , at least from the rich , wants to pay more taxes , and whose critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
escape : &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence is part of women who escape alone , almost in everyday life .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often traumati@@ zed .
a house is a refuge .
there are four women sitting in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby , which is at most a year old .
one has put her little son in her arm .
he looked curi@@ ously into the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is observed .
she s@@ miles and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you talk with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the division manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor for social welfare services in Bavaria , and deals with the topic of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are refugees .
they live in the North of Munich in one of the few de@@ centralized units for single @-@ wing@@ ed women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs has set up the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich women &apos;s help .
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - even not as visitors .
the exception is a guard against the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them as hop@@ eful@@ s to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; women out@@ weigh other reasons for the flight : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly , because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , hon@@ our@@ able mor@@ als , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
that drives them away .
on the run , that goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , that tu@@ gs demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
whoever believes that the end , as soon as they refu@@ te in Germany , is ast@@ ray , says B@@ ahr .
here too , single women in refugee camps would often be regarded as inferior and ab@@ used in the worst case .
this means that about 90 percent of women who live in accommodation in the north of Munich are traumati@@ zed , they appreciate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not born voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so accustomed to saying nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the experience because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know how to help , they need more accommodation only for them , requests B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven regional governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question of whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction , some respond with no .
in Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there is no such thing in shel@@ ters of governments .
even in Sw@@ ab@@ ians alone , wing@@ ed women are not accommodated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government .
in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia there are in some Community accommodation floors or own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodation for women only .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rights of Women and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommodated separately from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are har@@ assed separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the privacy is missing or men and women are accommodated together , there can be continuous violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all , the washing rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , is included in the study .
how much the women feel this need of protection can be read from the cr@@ ush that it gives to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it has been around for us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily make a second home .
assistance centres : demands for new work campaigns
representatives of the Assist@@ ants have called their union to appro@@ ve new work campaigns in their disputes relating to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more safety campaigns from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that there would have been ministers to deal with the concerns of the contract .
assist physicians and medical students have agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the B@@ MA in July .
he was rejected by 58 % of its members voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members who were published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chair@@ woman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; per@@ sever@@ ing quietly &quot; problems , which led to the withdrawal of the treaty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC Board has agreed to fully reject the proposed new treaty and request official re@@ negotiations for all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board today conven@@ ed a formal request for a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council in order to appro@@ ve a running programme of escal@@ ating labor fighting activities starting at the beginning of September .
the disputes led to the fact that Assist@@ ance doctors struck six times this year , the first overall failures in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the B@@ MA assistant doctors Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana returned to the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions that had been advised by the B@@ MA .
he shared B@@ MA members during the sessions held before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistants and medical students that the contract was advantageous and should be accepted .
after the vote , the Health Minister Jerem@@ y H@@ unt said that the contract for doctors in England would be forci@@ bly introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end to the eight months of war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter @-@ player in the gold @-@ plated Hall of St. Petersburg Palace , I can &apos;t resist the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile seemed to be tri@@ cky and he barely radi@@ ated warmth , even for his restra@@ ined relations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an , on the other hand , spoke of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
the next day , a newspaper described that Erd@@ og@@ an had beha@@ ved like that would never be anything bad .
to me his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ating , sustainable cows showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had nothing to forget .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was kind@@ led .
Putin came out and accused Ankara to fall back to Russia .
the off@@ ence was even greater because it was committed by a presum@@ ed friend .
building up the vet@@ oes will be difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months the state controlled media conducted a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would blame for everything .
the most serious accus@@ ations were that Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
after all , this meeting took place only because Putin received the ap@@ ology from the President Erd@@ og@@ an , who he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire are obvious .
Erd@@ og@@ an needs first and foremost all the friends he can get after spending last month with a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat of almost his ministry .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey severely - in particular the ban on charter flights that usually bring millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when flights are res@@ um@@ ed .
they count on a late seasonal ons@@ lau@@ ght on the Mediterranean Sea .
this week , the country television forecast cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed .
a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; tourists there , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious on the West , as it considers the reaction to the attempted power tak@@ eover as a weak answer .
in addition , the continued res@@ ent@@ ment on the sn@@ ail stamp of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is anxious to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West .
the Russian head of state won in Ankara a bonus that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is a matter of course for Moscow that has a deep fear of regime change .
the summit in this da@@ zz@@ ling palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to present an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; as an analy@@ st once described : two countries that have been viol@@ ated and badly treated by the West and are now allied .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played a role as a peac@@ emaker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents at the press conference said that they had not even stri@@ pped the subject .
the President of Turkey deliberately avoided responding to a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ise this .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian struggle jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk to each other at least .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
according to the Board of Directors of the Bank , the R@@ BS brand is to be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan said to the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself since it had to be collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer goods brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don Win@@ ner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to put more national brands into focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , de@@ centralised headquarters and stock quotes will change to Nat@@ West .
Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for retail banking that will gain more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
during a sightseeing tour , Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re during a sightseeing tour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B becomes our investor brand and the brand under which our employees will be employed , as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I now say that we don &apos;t pursue global goals , but local objectives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers among these brands .
R@@ BS has already said that it will not continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop into the Bank of the Br@@ ands , because how do we focus internally ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the CEO .
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago , if we said that we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these stamps again , so I think time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches his 3.@@ 000@@ th win at New@@ market on Pre@@ dil@@ ection
D@@ ett@@ ori sparkling champagne after a double at New@@ market , bringing him $ 3@@ 000@@ th
on Friday , Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori won his 3,@@ 000@@ th British profit at New@@ market .
he set a milestone on pre@@ dil@@ ection trained by John Gos@@ den on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey who reached the milestone in the flat race .
he succ@@ eeds Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori susp@@ ects the che@@ er when he pi@@ cks up victory on Pre@@ dil@@ ection
two jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who scored more than 4,@@ 300 wins in a record breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career paths
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey in the modern world and it &apos;s no surprise that he achieved this milestone reached only a few before him .
he has style and is strong , but it &apos;s his tac@@ tical intell@@ ect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charism@@ a have been enth@@ r@@ alled fans for years for this kind of sport .
I told Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already had 6.000 winn@@ ings if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie already suffered more than 30 years of winner in the UK , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying D@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and got a drug prohibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three years ago he had difficulty when he returned from his six months lock , but he showed an impressive character to de@@ fy his two @-@ fl@@ yers and return to his best form .
and he hasn &apos;t finished yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori has once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to his at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of age .
Russian President Mo@@ ist@@ ed Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expect@@ edly released Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov &apos;s Chief of Staff .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of the nar@@ row@@ est trust group of Putin for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Represent@@ ative for environmental and transport affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin it reads that without giving reasons , Putin has ordered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ mis@@ sal of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been Vice President since 2012 , was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in the Estonian capital Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy .
on the website of the Krem@@ lin it means ( in Russian ) that he later was the Chief of Officer and Chief of Staff of the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it &apos;s the most important task of the government to support your work as head of state regarding bills of law and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov was asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
are the smiling faces convincing ?
this step has made Moscow more mysterious .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest confi@@ dant Vladimir Putin and worked as he was for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the chief of staff res@@ ig@@ ns at his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
is here the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at present .
but the official claim - that a man who was once glorified as a potential president , at once would like to lead Russian environmental policy - came across great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin , quoted on the Krem@@ lin website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - to entr@@ ust a job for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian president &apos;s administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the item in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and , like Putin , former member of the K@@ GB National Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was the chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin arrived in power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted in most .
once it was believed that after Putin &apos;s second term of office , Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia , as a third term of Putin had viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another close to Putin &apos;s allies , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before he became the president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved last month in a physical examination on the set of the series in Los Angeles .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced his dis@@ mis@@ sal in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the special agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , ap@@ ologi@@ zed publicly on Thursday before the announcement of his dis@@ mis@@ sal .
on the set it came to artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details of how the character Gib@@ son from the series , which follows a team of FB@@ I agents , is expected to be published at a later stage according to the statement of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old who previously played in the sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g has been there since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and put my whole heart blood in the last twelve years , &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday .
I was hoping to be there until the end , but that will no longer be possible .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans who can only wish for a series .
the planned airing of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28 .
puzzles for fish , which landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a resident of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that the 75 fish might act as sandals that were spi@@ ked by a fountain of foun@@ tains .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published a video of the spectacle on Per@@ is@@ cope in the hope that someone might shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ ferry Crossing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the northern deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings to the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cover blo@@ wers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which approach the completion by each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10.000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 obli@@ que cables .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017 .
economic Minister Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ or cross country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project involving over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fit .
in total , almost 79 % of the total bridge is at their place and the last section of Dec@@ ks today gets a concrete kiss for the deck in Ros@@ y@@ th , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place .
Michael Martin , project leader of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project .
with this fantastic project , the closure is ground@@ breaking high @-@ rise and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last section of the street and its connection with the north tower , we had to close the existing gap on the north or the north side .
this was achieved by pulling the northern entry bridge 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
mas@@ sif , as the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs approx . 6.000 tons and has to be pulled upwards at an incline of about 3 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delicate , because the tolerances on which the team worked , were tiny - they were just a few milli@@ metres on each side . &quot; &quot; &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; rescue in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lucky to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lucky to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown from their fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station hit the alarm on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming in safety , while their boat moved from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat turned around and set us the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leader of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds have blown the boat out of reach , until we left to water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were res@@ cu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found hanging on a bu@@ o@@ y without a life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men thrown into the water have luck un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the boat engine had an emergency stop , it loos@@ ened the boat from the person who ste@@ ered the boat .
someone has watched over these men today .
badly injured - man pun@@ ishes his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .
as the police said yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had given the key to the apartment to pick up his personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
instead , the alcoholic bl@@ ender cut the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
when he entered the apartment , he stab@@ bed them twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was hurt by the hand and the body .
the police could arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother .
this then al@@ arms his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm down her brother .
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
therefore she went out of the house with her companions .
on the street they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ partner .
when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who builds affordable apartments for Braunschweig ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Gre@@ ens say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investors should be taken into duty much more strongly in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 inexpensive apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; action plan living &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next council session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but argument is programmed .
first and foremost , it is about the question : who should build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing until now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : if you want to build on urban areas , 20 percent of all apartments must be considered social housing in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the favorable apartments may also arise in the continu@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the big dispute in the town hall is , however , said Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to deal with investors who want to build on private areas ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such surfaces , but as much as 20 per cent of the flats as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing development programme , which will cost millions and still needs to be financed , should provide incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , such as Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the frac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few regulations as possible .
the left wants even harder editions for investors .
no matter what a fr@@ ying man , a sharpen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market ap@@ points .
if the action concept is implemented , this will take care of additional tasks in the construction management .
more staff is needed .
it is not clear whether we will receive the skilled workers .
but the programme is not entirely complete : the 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how do you reconci@@ le the loss of further 1,@@ 300 affordable apartments whose promotion will exp@@ ire in the next few years ?
by 2020 alone there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , the planning policy spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm should now be purchased from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought of bringing back apartments back into price loyalty .
this is possible in the western city .
the problem could be solved in one fell s@@ woo@@ p .
at the end of the year , in the western part of the city , deadlines are coming out .
around 1800 Apartments can be picked up there in the price connection for cheap apartments .
only : they do not want the owners , the housing companies .
because the number of social housing in the Western city is dras@@ tically increased again , from the goal of so @-@ called confusion .
there should be no more concentration of social weak in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens are counting on the fact that there is still movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U must go into the boat for a broad majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this has concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise cannot yet be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunting for health and happiness that is worth it
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
the fact that teenagers and children are no longer going outside but prefer to spend their free time star@@ ing on screens has been compl@@ aining of many in the last decade .
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on vide@@ og@@ ames and recently on smartphones .
so it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities don &apos;t exclude each other .
of course , I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later resulting in a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
as many phenomena of pop culture , the interest before the publication of the game sank in the USA , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July .
market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that the servers over@@ loaded .
within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ emon that will be tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the del@@ usion and jump@@ ed for the search of the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the United States , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person returns every day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Car@@ di@@ kilograms , an app for Apple Watch , followed by 3@@ 5.000 users , the Washington Post recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of people who followed each day jump@@ ed 30 minutes , jump@@ ed from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it merely looks the raw data for performance improvement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns that people want to take &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coming from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; being active every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; launched de@@ af ears because many public messages are boring for health and coming from people that look mis@@ erable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ valued .
anyone who regularly drives sports reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoor that fun .
thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even include new friend@@ ships during the hunt .
as always there are also g@@ rump@@ y games that have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what &apos;s it like ?
it has made a breakthrough .
even if Smartphone @-@ Apps like Fit@@ bit could track our activity earlier , they didn &apos;t give us any reason to play sports like this game does .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will fade with time .
however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and help many people to hunt more active , f@@ itter and heal@@ thier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is immune to all this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the floor .
on complete line brilliant .
and now finally the Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast stran@@ gled on Thursday to win the title and enlarged the gap between herself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her total result of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 clearly stood in front of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mates A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the American women Simone Bil@@ es Tur@@ ns on the Swedish beam during the individual multi @-@ campaign team of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American , who wins a multi @-@ fight title and a total of the fifth , while she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey ended at that moment .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years her sport , 15 world champion med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with such amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion from 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ cue told her that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it awa@@ ited them a final test in Brazil , a competition that did not go so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered dis@@ appointment .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the individual multi @-@ campaign of women at the summer Olympics 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as an ex@@ clamation mark at the farewell party of the retired team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
although it insist@@ ed that during their long journey on the top , never having planned the future , it is not really true .
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is adapted to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not accidental .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a little child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school excursion into the gymn@@ asi@@ um in which Bo@@ or@@ man trained , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , she has lost no more competition , a winning stre@@ ak that will last as long as Bil@@ es wishes .
even though Sam@@ af@@ ina was led slightly by two turns , the image dec@@ ei@@ ves .
ro@@ ast beams and dent@@ ur@@ ns - in which Bil@@ es holds the world championship title - lau@@ tered .
she got back again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the Swedish beam - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor there was another one .
Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ g@@ ged her sof@@ tly when she expected her final b@@ ust - a pure form of form@@ ality - and tears poured on Bil@@ es brilli@@ antly red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , when the vision she once described in her book book became reality .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal went to Must@@ af@@ ina in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team of men who is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Grand@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a lead . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her ground practice she cast kis@@ ses to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback that sometimes seemed doubt@@ ful .
as for Bil@@ es , the fast @-@ expanding T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a whole new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims shot in serial killer when listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot , who died in one of the most deadly attacks since a decade in the first serial killer of Phoenix while listening to the car and listening to music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand fire@@ arm while standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle , is read in the report .
the police informed that the triple murder did not seem to be the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , as the att@@ acker didn &apos;t take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who owned one of the adult victims .
the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investig@@ ators to have a closer look at whether it is connected to four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in nine attacks during four months , and two others were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential neighborhood in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Howard of K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is believed that the susp@@ ects have used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah still died .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which turned to an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and it is assumed that it was the factory of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ age sleeves and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with a micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but as the f@@ ew@@ est of his anti@@ quity enjoyed Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to did not know during her pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought was , I don &apos;t create that .
I don &apos;t create that .
I did not let myself go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is wrong at all -- of course , one has left it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband Vincent and you were told that Ed@@ mund can never recognize them under circumstances and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a wal@@ let .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l until his third year of age and he still cannot speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth displays the sign language that Ed@@ mund made for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing me something before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we teach him a sign language , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some characters on his own .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic like in Ed@@ mund , as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and progn@@ oses may vary greatly .
it is still too early to tell how it will affect the life of the infected with the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they still don &apos;t know .
I have been asking for the prog@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect someone to really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it will be better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
severe rainf@@ all , floo@@ ding gives rise to b@@ ail@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ds in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to proclaim the emergency on Friday . it is expected to have more rainf@@ alls all Saturday .
numerous rivers in the south @-@ east of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi River flooded their banks and threatened with large floo@@ ds after extreme rainf@@ alls , the National Weather Service reported .
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards told that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the way to the communities concerned .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand sacks increased .
Ste@@ ele said that only the commune of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ ua had demanded ten thousand sand sacks .
a flood warning system is used over large parts in southern Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service allowed in this area to drop additional 3 to 5 inches in rain .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood warning system was deployed on Friday , while it was still ra@@ ining in the mobile area .
the river Com@@ es near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will all probability reach record levels over the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the regions near Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a downstream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish represents a danger , as these rivers only slowly flow into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the Ti@@ ck@@ sha@@ w River , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi state border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.@@ 00 .
rescue teams still be@@ headed people from floo@@ ding in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , rose strongly overnight .
he said that another step of step living nearby would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water flow@@ ed and poured in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife said Hans@@ ford that during the 48 years she had never seen such a high level of the river .
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all the disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that N@@ oth@@ el@@ fer had res@@ cu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ be , where they were housed until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had spread quickly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities were considering evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer reported in the vicinity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the soil was greatly su@@ cked by rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ alls and floo@@ ds caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ ua Par@@ ish and teaching in five school districts .
the WW@@ L C@@ BS subsidiary reported that a passenger in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated to two churches that were both flooded .
the Chief of the Rob@@ by Miller Community said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets that were r@@ ins@@ ed by floo@@ ds .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were established to house the evacu@@ ees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the water begins to return , they will be able to return to their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond , the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa has closed almost two dozens of streets due to floo@@ ding and sand@@ bags for residents to take part , hoping to keep the water out of their houses and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last major floo@@ ding we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the Emer@@ gency Manager Rupert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his information , a handful of houses were reported to be flooded on Thursday , but no reported on Friday .
Keith Town@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has lived in the area for 40 years .
&quot; I have seen water in places I have never seen before , &quot; Town@@ son said , &quot; and it is still coming . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kno@@ cked out of spheres , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police announces that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week already the second time a six @-@ year @-@ old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents stated that Brown was suffering several injuries , including in the lo@@ ins , leg , arm , and stomach , but that he was in the hospital with his transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did a lot , his small body was pun@@ ched by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z shared the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family shared the transmitter that he is expected to recover .
he would have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
also shot were three men : two aged 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found at the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old who finds himself in a critical condition , shot up , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police found out if one of the wounded men could be the perpetr@@ ator .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia that apparently there was a cross@@ fire between several arch@@ ers .
cartridge r@@ ins@@ ets for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were traced back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , approached the crime scene .
it seems that this is clearly a continual battle .
on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , were leg@@ umes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here , several armed fighters seem to have been involved , who were very active , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said police officer Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area hit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no arrest and the police are re@@ port@@ edly monitoring the surveillance video . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cross trainer on the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential neighborhood of West O@@ ak Lane .
she reco@@ vers and the police is still searching for a suspect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I imagine under the Women &apos;s Olympics in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that for more than one reason .
first , I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three gymn@@ asts , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , which is Catholic , makes everyone proud .
this team is finally reflected in the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and his@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one among female gymn@@ asts was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year , Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprise Olympic winner and the US che@@ ered .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three @-@ fold world champion@@ ships in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected , yet master@@ ful gy@@ mas@@ tics routines .
on Thursday , Simone became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American , who won gold at an individual multi @-@ campaign event .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we are experiencing the top of this sport , but this is not the case in the whole country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie took all the same path as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to create it into the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympic team will have only four gymn@@ asts in the team . moreover , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality is that gymn@@ as@@ tics are an expensive sport and gymn@@ asts first and foremost in private sports clubs that are maintained by parents , which arise for training , furnishing , travel , competition and hotel costs ( for trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) .
the majority of these trainers are in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support business .
in these clubs , the gymn@@ asts maintain their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both trained their athletes since they started the gymn@@ as@@ tics .
we have to give the municipalities out countless , young girls inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , providing a more affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ reach exercise .
I founded my annual foundation of 20 years .
at my events , we have offered free and affordable accommodation in Harlem for more than 15,000 young people ( especially black and his@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer young high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determin@@ at@@ eness for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that will bring thousands of young girls interested in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this genuine representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by organizing the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thank you for being motivated so many young girls with varying backgrounds to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistant doctors want to organise further strikes after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
the ministers had hoped to finish the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the British Medical Association &apos;s officials , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 Assist@@ ants who voted at a choice rejected him .
in July , H@@ unt announced plans to introduce the treaty forced and said that the N@@ HS would be in a &quot; no man &apos;s land &quot; and would be harmful to the employees and patients .
the first assistants shall receive a new contract that contains changes to night and weekend dates in order to improve the maintenance of hours of movement .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , chair@@ woman of the B@@ MA Committee for Assist@@ ance , announced last night in a communication with : &quot; assistant doctors have still serious concerns about the proposed treaty , especially that it will heat up the current workforce crisis and it will meet all doctors . &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and time runs out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; efforts by the B@@ MA to resolve disputes arising from discussions encountered the government on its own reluc@@ t@@ ance and sometimes de@@ af@@ ening silence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was done by a promise that Jerem@@ y H@@ unt had made only last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y H@@ unt must act now to raise awareness and address the concerns of assistant doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should he not do this , the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further work campaigns .
the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nur@@ ses and specialists were included in order to allow doctors to cover the strike post chain .
the ministers had hoped to finish the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed contract with the British Medical Association &apos;s officials .
the B@@ MA wants a better week@@ end@@ compensation for the 5@@ 4,000 resident doctors who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director of the N@@ HS staff , urged the assistants to stop the strike .
Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work combat measures do not achieve anything that only little , but strain already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , nur@@ ses and their families only worry , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last two months we talked to the committee of assistants and responded positively to the concerns about guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whist@@ le@@ playing with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries .
employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as posting , flexibility in training , additional training for those who are returning from vocational training , training courses , reci@@ pro@@ cal recognition of the curriculum , training holidays and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health concerning compliance with the agreements with the B@@ MA were in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day drug that can reduce heart rate risk
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug after being advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the medicine is administered after a heart attack for 12 months , thereby reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attack .
N@@ ICE &apos;s regulatory authority has recommended for a period of four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
N@@ ICE &apos;s regulatory authority has recommended for a period of four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer a further heart attack or a stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fat @-@ containing material in the ar@@ tery walls .
when the flooring disper@@ ses , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots causing blood flow to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots dissolve , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca , marketed under the Bri@@ li@@ que trade name , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots unlikely .
the draft of N@@ ICE , published today , recommends a 12 month dose of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Heal@@ th@@ echn@@ ology Evaluation Center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who have suffered a heart attack or a stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in is effective in reducing other heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who already had a heart attack .
due to a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ tness has allowed electoral fraud in Muslim areas to flour@@ ish
former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man was removed last year due to corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ tness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities , ignor@@ ing how a devastating government report today revealed .
Sir Eric Pick@@ les , former cabinet member , interven@@ es verb@@ ally with the police , election ob@@ servers , and town halls for ignor@@ ing the evidence of electoral abuse on the basis of &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ no and religion . &quot;
the former minister of integration and communal government , which is now an antagon@@ ist king , said that intim@@ id@@ ation of voters from religious themes would be so bad that the police were allowed to set up lock@@ ers outside elec@@ tive cabins to protect intim@@ id@@ ated voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that voters should take a document to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at present , a vot@@ er must simply call his name and address . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report suggests not to remove removable ink onto the finger of a person when they leave their vote to prevent someone to choose twice .
whist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
it demands that the press should have more access to municipal materials and decisions from un@@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this not only serves against electoral fraud , but is also meant to protect the municipal government from the wider corruption and financial fraud culture associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Dow@@ ning Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets &apos;s election sc@@ andal in eastern London .
last year , a special electoral court ruled that the inc@@ umbent mayor of Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man should be dismissed after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his office .
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way , &quot; and that he sil@@ enced his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia accus@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 votes were either du@@ bi@@ ous or the consequence of im@@ itation in which one person chooses another .
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of fraud throughout the country .
he vo@@ iced particularly alar@@ ming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent brief@@ ing - in which older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including guiding of ID to prove the identity
in his report it says : &quot; as evidence has been attached that pressure has been exer@@ ted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , especially women and young people , to choose according to the will of the elders , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or b@@ ang@@ la@@ esch@@ ic background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... governmental institutions have know@@ ingly ignored such behaviour as a result of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to ethnic and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition of political activists to process letter selection documents in order to stop &quot; election harvest . &quot;
the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also demands harder registration checks to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and social security purposes .
consider options to ask voters before choosing according to your ID .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has handed her voice to prevent someone to choose twice .
conduct systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to ensure that they are in@@ discrimin@@ ate .
a three @-@ year limitation to applications for an automatic letter selection .
prohibition that political activists process full post @-@ elections and envel@@ op@@ es of letter sel@@ ections .
give the police the authority to set up lock@@ outs for election stations .
amend@@ ment of the law facilit@@ ated by an indictment for intim@@ id@@ ation in accordance with the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( Legisl@@ ative Act 1983 ) .
taking pictures of photograph@@ ing stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the election stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the employees generally assert that voters go into the elec@@ tive cabin alone .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case there was no penalty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Elec@@ toral Court has declared Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as in@@ compatible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to a number of reasons , he was ple@@ aded guilty according to the high requirements of the criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check controls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the election registration departments of the city halls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
our country is a proud heir as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .
crazy about K@@ ates bicy@@ cli@@ st Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous double @-@ go@@ ers of Olympic athletes in Rio
this week , fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio will be amazed at the French cycli@@ st Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T , which proved to be an impressive Doppel@@ gän@@ ger of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ ad is by far not the only athle@@ tic ath@@ lete with its own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not if you are allowed to give faith to the social media .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are currently running on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympics that have more than a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the h@@ unter and the wolf : team member of the US team at the Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio
besides K@@ ate &apos;s Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the rac@@ et@@ rack , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher of the twin from A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be .
the team member of the US team in the bow shooting Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son has created a tower on Twitter , after images on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself don &apos;t see any simil@@ arity with the exception of facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I guess this as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ jum@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her big expressive eyes will be able to go through the Cub@@ an @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a step higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another persistent comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal s@@ wimm@@ ers Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the sun@@ tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair as the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan was attacked by fans to resem@@ ble an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also liked the simil@@ arities
theory in space : according to this user there might be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the pair
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet is thinking that Hope &apos;s Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons covered K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney , as well as the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , who has her own beautiful , wide smile , resem@@ bling the Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ olog@@ ises for his statement that Chinese swi@@ mmer@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a pig has died &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds &apos;s analysis of the fourth place of the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Ai Yan@@ han at d@@ r 4x@@ 200m Fre@@ estyle staff@@ ed audience of the C@@ BC live broadcast of the Ol@@ m@@ yp@@ ical Games on Wednesday
the Canadian radio station C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese swi@@ mmer &quot; as M@@ ief went off &quot; and during the race like &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was switched off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m freedom fighter squ@@ ad@@ ron .
Mac@@ Donald , who had been brought on board in the commentary team of the C@@ BS in order to give more colour , one could hear : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese woman has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited , as I called M@@ ief , died like a pig .
thanks for it .
the Chinese swi@@ mmer Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swim squ@@ ad@@ ron 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled the Can@@ adi@@ ans to close the gap to China .
spectators across Canada quickly re@@ acted online after being shocked by the sound and the language
Em@@ met@@ t Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; Do@@ es the C@@ BC comment@@ ator have just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old float in China &quot; like a pig has died ? ? ? ? ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot didn &apos;t break that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the criticism against B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard , with many of him talking about him
Twitter users did not res@@ ign when they heard how un@@ sensitive B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter username Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and lets all of us look like Ras@@ si@@ sten . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
shortly afterwards Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC show , ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we are sorry that the comment has been broadcast over a swim performance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ happy formulation , sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 times with the people who responded to the information about Twitter .
the comment@@ ator colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for himself in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users compl@@ aining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and delivered a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret it sincer@@ ely that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
yesterday night we quickly ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers on the show and our fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ ies in the social media .
to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ on &apos;s comments related to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not to them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ happy formulation . B@@ yr@@ on does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the show and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention to be designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the female pool of women in the C@@ BC Olympics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have referred to the power of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not to them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was intended and I am very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged about women who tried sham@@ elessly ling@@ erie in the middle of the shop
the buyers didn &apos;t know where to look , when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ ck to try sub@@ h@@ osen .
in order to wor@@ sen the situation , she scrut@@ ini@@ zed how she looked at it , pulled her out and put her back to the shelf .
she continued and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone where the woman ta@@ sted the pants before she put her back to the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ d@@ son , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman tried under@@ wear , &quot; she went back and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the show@@ room she picked up a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled out her own ti@@ ghts and pants and ta@@ sted her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when they pulled out the pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as they put them back on the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same thing with three more under@@ pants , before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like it again and went out again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it did not seem to distur@@ b anyone - or think about the person who would possibly buy the pants that she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how reluc@@ t@@ antly anyone would take home trousers which had another person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have received , the employees have tried to pull out clothes from the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and pulled out and didn &apos;t wash it again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident taking place on Tuesday 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a before weapons attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you .
we spoke with Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand@@ master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York , to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at a distance .
regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from the back , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer for your rob@@ ber .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when you approach you from behind , you should turn around as first so that you can see your att@@ acker and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go out of the line &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then grab the weapon between your front arm and shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
beat him with the knee in the bar and turn , while the att@@ acker s@@ lashes in front of pain , the weapon out of his hands . hit him with the run into your face and move backwards while doing the weapon on him .
with att@@ ack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the weapon and twist it so that the att@@ acker cannot shoot .
at the same time , shift the weight to the weapon and hit the att@@ acker on your chest , then turn the weapon out of its grip , before moving backwards and directing the weapon to it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it pre@@ fers Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that if you don &apos;t have a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master , it &apos;s the saf@@ est thing to over@@ take your money .
traveler Ian W@@ right sh@@ ab@@ t for a gu@@ ide@@ book his tongue at the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ took his immune system and thro@@ ws a serious test by le@@ aking some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k put his train on a euro note , a rail@@ ing at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a r@@ ins@@ ing button of a draw toilet as well as a public telephone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before the ind@@ entation of each object he used a lumin@@ ous ometer to show himself and us what he is going on .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight .
the thought to check the flus@@ hing button of a draw toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe Mr. W@@ right spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately nothing left what he li@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resili@@ ence of his bow@@ el by traveling through the world and ate strange as well as wonderful things .
from public roads to train stations to dish@@ washers , the task proved to be the immune system definitely below a sample
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child , I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and slu@@ dge water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the movie he was able to live up to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its test strip showed a lumin@@ ance count of more than 4000 units .
compared to that , the lumin@@ ance number of freshly washed hands amounts to less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to reject after their lumin@@ ance was over 4000 units while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 .
Mr. W@@ right and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; showing the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this comes close to the worst thing I have sm@@ elled in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more dirty than that !
I will not lick here anything because it is disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company provides Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ ore@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to look and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ bio@@ tics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we performed crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended that we said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; call us Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put it in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film directing , added : &quot; let me say it this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had ta@@ sted some of the things I told him to lick , just like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the movie . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to h@@ ul@@ le them and others , in which this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad we recorded some of these dirty delicacies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 84 percent of all respon@@ dents associated lac@@ tic acid bacteria , especially with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ine , and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ cial family destroyed before del@@ o@@ gi@@ ate social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ cial family left their social housing after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ ance with a loss of £ 50,000 because it had terrori@@ zed their neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ vis@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls had g@@ lowing holes , wood floors were torn , garbage was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that she is now living in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ vo@@ y , who works for house management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was a night@@ mare for people here and I believe people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property is probably considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also known .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted on street fighting with bas@@ eball bats , intim@@ id@@ ation of residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking and excessive writing , disputes and cur@@ ses .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , was in June an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior .
in some rooms of the house , which will be torn down under circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found
in the estate where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wood floors were torn up
neighbours told that they had to fight them on the street and regularly inv@@ oked the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ o@@ gi@@ ated her and her partner this week forci@@ bly from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily surrender .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said that their lives were made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They shou@@ ted for no one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad .
the countless times we tell the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this morning we could not sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
now , where they are finally gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have planned the family to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was sum@@ mon@@ ed at regular intervals for 20 years .
on the over@@ grown side of the church building , tr@@ ash and old toys were thrown down
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the les@@ see agreed to accept any responsibility for her behaviour and family , as del@@ o@@ gi@@ zing is always the last step to consider Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be horri@@ bly seen for their neighbors .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have courage@@ ously approached us and have given us the information .
I hope that this development will provide comfort to some neighbours and the message conve@@ ys that anti@@ social behaviour is not tolerated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ gi@@ zing on the ground .
workers of the house administration will now need to evacu@@ ate garbage mountains surrounding the house
in 2014 the police introduced a raid in the house and found more than 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don received a fine , after acquiring the property of a class B drug in trading intent .
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
after they were homeless , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many walls of the house were decorated with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that she will deleg@@ ate rent@@ ers who do not stick to the house rules
Angela C@@ row by the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall told that the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can act without self @-@ reproach and those who were har@@ med by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to cooperate with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal reloc@@ ated to panic after an eff@@ lied military jet beach flies
sun wor@@ ship@@ pers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
a Portuguese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft of the air force forces placed an incredible crash
the air force forces stated that it was on a training flight , but insist@@ ed that no security risk occurred .
this was the moment when frigh@@ tened tourists started to panic after having a ti@@ ph@@ leg@@ ged jet crashing over a full beach .
dramatic video sho@@ ot@@ ings showed how the military plane flew almost in close proximity to the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers jump@@ ed up , understand@@ ably , to worry about the noise of the fire@@ works without first seeing what happened through the clouds .
the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers posted videos on the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; it flew two times really deep and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane fell on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at Av@@ eiro &apos;s beach were terri@@ fied when the plane came out of the darkness and was incredibly low flew
the Portuguese air forces today stated that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fis@@ her boats off the coast and thus had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the speaker said that due to the poor visibility the jet flew somewhat deeper than usual due to the poor visibility conditions , but the air forces ins@@ ist on the fact that safety at no time was at risk .
land fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , where four people on Madeira Island came to death .
the Portuguese air forces today stated that the pilot had to fly so deeply due to the circumstances - heavy fog and smoke - which restric@@ ts his sight .
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fis@@ her boats as part of the exercise
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with cares about Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step in the new football season on Sunday .
the Catal@@ ans compete in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup against the FC Sevilla , the back@@ lash rises three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ gain has to do without compromising the subordin@@ ate C@@ up@@ fin@@ alists and reig@@ ning Europe League champion among others at N@@ ey@@ mar , who den@@ ies the Olympic football tournament with Brazil .
in addition , there is also Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen .
in the course of the training , the German suffered a change of lig@@ aments in the knee , thus clari@@ fying the demand for Bar@@ ca at least for the time being in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen in Barcelona have been playing the status as number one for two years .
in this respect , Coach Luis En@@ rique made a clear decision in this respect and left Bra@@ vo in the League , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most other applications .
before the first mandatory game of the new season , the Spanish master doubts about the fitness level of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test match between Liverpool and 0 : 4 .
also at 3 : 2 in the rehear@@ sal stop against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. didn &apos;t really know how to convince them .
Sev@@ ille , in turn , has continued to di@@ gest the 2 : 3 defeat in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and aims for the second triumph in the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
with up to now , Barcelona is the record winner of this competition .
Ma Long in a own league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic winner .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12.@@ 5.@@ 4.4 ) in a one @-@ sided fin@@ als on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro .
with that the world rank first won the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with achievements at the World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and the Olympics .
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ zu@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made the title among themselves .
thus it was clear that for the third time in succession , a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five rings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top of Olympia was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left to the record alone , between the sentences and in time outs they had no coaches with them .
they with@@ drew to the grand@@ stand and left their prot@@ ectors on one other in a fair competition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I played the matches till here for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang had said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game posed gold and silver med@@ alli@@ sts with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
Ma had to fight with his 28 year old opponent only in the first sentence .
after that he set the pace on the record and left Z@@ hang as only a total of 13 points .
through the superi@@ ority of Ma did not develop the expected ro@@ using match .
however , however , sufficient breath @-@ taking ball@@ ots were to be seen .
Mi@@ zu@@ ani won the Bronze game against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in his quarter @-@ final against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the White @-@ rus@@ se had moved to a ri@@ b @-@ breaking ceremony , after that he had to be treated with sheet metal .
the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) have , by the way , become a similarly high table tennis player Olympia @-@ Vi@@ erte .
Donald Tru@@ mp ad@@ mits ″ enormous problems ″ in the election campaign
the leadership of the US rep@@ ublic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative federal states to lose their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp served to weak@@ en his election campaign in the former Republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the Mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire is usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident , expressed as concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported .
after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals out of the race within the own republi@@ can camp , doubts pers@@ ist in his success in the battle for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp , before evangel@@ ical Christians , who asked for support in major states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guilt was false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he res@@ um@@ ed his well @-@ known media @-@ sh@@ um@@ ed again .
republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds wi@@ g@@ gle
U@@ tah is usually a safe bank for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ USA from June , Tru@@ mp and his rival were equ@@ ated by the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutes see Tru@@ mp in front , but not with the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered .
in an interview of the CN@@ BC , Tru@@ mp replied to the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton &apos;s advance : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and afterwards : this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does nothing else than telling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it did not suff@@ ice for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , he said , Tru@@ mp continued .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party Tru@@ mp is said to have threatened to paint funds to support his election campaign , he should not be able to present any better survey values .
instead , the candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans would appeal to the Congress more strongly .
Olympia : three @-@ star fraud on dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C intends to set up a disciplinary committee .
Kenya &apos;s athletes face the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympics .
after a trial attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee was to immediately set up a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary announced that the former S@@ printer and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine sample under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch in the Olympic Village .
this was reported to the team leader K@@ eni@@ as by the Dop@@ ing Contro@@ ll@@ ers .
the IA@@ AF World Federation has requested the IO@@ C for information about the case to enforce its own investigations , shared an IA@@ AF or@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IO@@ C , IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she stated in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and referred to as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch , handed down and signed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr K@@ eni@@ as Chief of Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was in possession of the accreditation of the ath@@ lete , who was on the list for training controls of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch had become a World Cup fourth of more than 800 meters in 2015 .
four days before , the Ken@@ yan Ath@@ le@@ tics delegation leader Michael Ro@@ ti@@ ch had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio games .
he is said to have informed sports@@ men of his country about upcoming dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports , he was said to have been arrested at his return to Nairobi &apos;s airport .
for a long time , Kenya has been under special observation after numerous dop@@ ing events .
at the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls submitted by the IO@@ C before the Rio Games , it was previously noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia will be targeted .
the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency had a great deal of pressure on the African country before the summer Olympics to create anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic start .
as a result , the WA@@ DA of Kenya participated in the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is con@@ forming to the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is regarded as a large runner nation .
the athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of television reports of the ARD , repro@@ aches were raised again and again that dop@@ ing means are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a significant ment@@ ality of sports fraud .
the IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had employed in Russian athle@@ tics .
this was demonstrated by the fact that in this kind of sport it was used nationwide and systematically .
Russia &apos;s athletes were then excluded from the summer play .
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Shakespeare year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic pair of love , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with it a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece .
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled a youth dream with the role of Maria .
in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses .
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have amber music in our blood !
in this stage Bart@@ oli plays an older Mary .
she re@@ members Tony with melanch@@ oly , while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
first because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and funny and bright . &quot;
so it is smart , of course na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; she resembles me very much , my Italian character , whom I have as Roman , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is an extremely generous human being .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli back the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in each of his movements , in his looks , it is his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temp@@ er , a fire , a passion and a cheerful approach to life , that is very important at all !
for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; highly topical : &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ce and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ans went to New York and the New Yor@@ kers did not want them .
they are the same subjects , and they are as meaningful today as they did at that time .
59 years later the piece is still relevant .
London School Girl , which joined the IS , was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za sult@@ ana , one of three British school girls who left London last year to join the IS , died in Syria .
the attorney Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that her family learned about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria a few weeks ago .
it was suspected that they were killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , reported I@@ TV news on Thursday .
Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and died in accordance with her family shortly after she pre@@ tended to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good is there - as warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - stop people from ever making this decision , &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e .
in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school girls from the east of London got into a plane in direction of Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border .
Sult@@ ana &apos;s family was told that she had married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria and became a widow within a few months .
Rei@@ d says that Clinton will remain as candidates for the Supreme Court in case of an election victory in Gar@@ land
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate Jud@@ ge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Republi@@ can Senate in Senate have blocked Gar@@ land &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Conn@@ ell believes the next president will appoint the successor of the dec@@ eased judge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects Clinton to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pick up gar@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Tre@@ ats wants to make nude calendar for &quot; women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazin works with photographer David Bell@@ em@@ ere to bring out a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired Calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 .
at the beginning of this year , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us that his nude magazine of Old@@ school Play@@ boys is distingu@@ ish@@ able as &quot; Play@@ boy for Men is . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he believes that it also does the Calendar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to return to the presentation of timeless and classic nude , where both women and men feel well and feel inspired by these images of a feminine body , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release for the publication of the calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
women will participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally at open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community counts with mass flight
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who does not suit and Erd@@ og@@ an lo@@ dges , sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the office of the Gü@@ len @-@ nearby Foundation Dialog and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kur@@ ds in Germany are counting tens of thousands of refugees fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany on short notice .
in the medium term , there could even be &quot; some hundred thousand , &quot; believes President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k .
due to the hard advance of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ ds of Germany expect a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; at short notice I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term , with some hundred thousand protection @-@ seek@@ ers from Turkey in Germany , when the Erd@@ og@@ an regime comb@@ ats minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the chairman Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government has already over@@ taken Kurdish stron@@ gh@@ olds with sanctions for months , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds are fle@@ eing within Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the desperate put@@ sch , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks were added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to start new in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state , which itself welcomes refugees , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the Association compl@@ ained of the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ mon@@ astic cities .
Erd@@ og@@ an wants to increase the expression pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradic@@ ated or driven out in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Federal Government called for the Federal Government to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be as sharp as Austria against Erd@@ og@@ an and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany there is also a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erd@@ og@@ an critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the br@@ anding as a Gü@@ len trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who does not suit and Erd@@ og@@ an lo@@ dges , sits on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the K@@ em@@ alists and sec@@ ul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ nearby foundation dialogue and education , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the newspaper reports on appeal to figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks already constituted the largest group of people who recognized political persecution in Germany because of political persecution .
at the date of June 30 , this was 11.@@ 3@@ 86 people and almost 29 per cent of all recognized as eligible for asylum ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this survey , there are no problems facing war , poverty or lack of vision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
asylum enti@@ tles in accordance with the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. by state side , individually persec@@ ut@@ ors .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals do not get anything from the summer election campaign with - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia must not choose the country day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until 2021 , the Parliament election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for it is not stupid to do so until now : summer holidays , heat and state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ day elections - that bites .
the locals , who are to be persu@@ aded by the pi@@ vot@@ ees , are on vacation .
most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers , who are in the country , on Use@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see on the go , are not locals , so they are not allowed to choose the land tag .
there are practical problems : during the holidays , hel@@ pers , posters hang up , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and vote in the end , only lab@@ orious .
by September 4 , 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern still has to pass by election campaign against the people .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now in poll@@ s clearly behind the CD@@ U .
exciting is how strongly Neul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of coalition dust .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous election campaign .
he travels through the country , spreads ro@@ ses and ch@@ ats a little with the people , just like his legendary elo@@ qu@@ ent predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff did .
otherwise , Seel@@ ering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame on the blossom@@ ing of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acceler@@ ates the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which is now probably going to cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U , with its top candidate , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make an election campaign at the right time at the wrong time .
she has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale production ; Merkel &apos;s parliamentary group is located in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vincent Co@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once .
otherwise , the Nor@@ theast CD@@ U does not abandon the usual election campaigns at market places and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that , so says Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union has also noted that you are un@@ le@@ ashing the base in the country that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are doing it like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any available in the vast expan@@ ses of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Council of the CD@@ U vot@@ er co@@ co@@ on to his comrades is self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must go where it hur@@ ts , where people are : village festivals , golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because there is much on the game , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed electoral campaign .
in poll@@ s , the Socialists and Democrats were recently compl@@ aining with 22 per cent behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just shortly before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
in the 2011 election , the SPD had clearly won 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in surveys , are likely to make the leap into the land day .
they make a modern virtue out of the necessity of holidays and move their electoral campaign largely into the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls it the president of the country Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , green elec@@ tors embar@@ k on trace search for local vocal ch@@ ats under the vac@@ ation@@ ers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ t just with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it also beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; electoral holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 refur@@ bish@@ ment : restaurants suffer from block@@ ages
there is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated .
for those responsible for the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and only end at 8 pm , there are all praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did everything pretty jag@@ ged , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super team .
there is also no delay .
the construction site could be moved to the south as planned at the start of the weekend , until the end of October everything will be ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the same applies to those responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to setting up accommodation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the construction site was moved to the south on Monday and the blocking of the Asp@@ erg@@ strasse in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen was lifted and thus also the connection to Rot@@ tenburg has again , the traffic situation within the village was relaxed .
the citizens can now travel from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were some considerable complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the deputy director Florian King for the rest@@ au@@ ration management of the refur@@ bish@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inhabitants of Bach@@ le@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ refrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ eping routes were seeking and more familiar with their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ age .
what led to some trucks in residential areas fran@@ chise .
as the speed limits were not met , the community also called for M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; there were significant transgres@@ sions , &quot; says King , who made himself on site about the situation .
there have already been two to three per minute flas@@ hed .
the fastest was on the way at 77 km / h in the speed @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
since the construction site has moved on , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business people at the B 27 it is only a little con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg the street is open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 refur@@ bish@@ ment of them has resulted in sales break@@ through@@ s allows everyone to look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
for those who have less to do with the &quot; end customer &quot; , so for other companies , the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Ma@@ ier Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at most slight drop &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also ad@@ mits that of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the running documentary is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most heavily exploited are the bars along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
not only him , but all the restaurants have &quot; hit hard . &quot;
the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil .
we need to be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he deci@@ ph@@ es the revenue losses to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far above 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the road marking has reduced its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to release half of his associates .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have responded differently .
instead , Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , if there could be a financial compensation with the reference , the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27 . now it must also bear the disadvantages that result from the refur@@ bish@@ ment .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where so much more generous has been handled .
with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , pointing to the long history .
that other regul@@ ars now look less frequently due to the complicated traffic guidance , he can understand .
if you cannot drive , it is also somewhere else beautiful .
that his family climate is returning after the end of the renovation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts .
despite the crises with BSE and avian influ@@ enza , G@@ öh@@ ner keeps the impact of the B 27 construction work on his clientele for the greatest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long @-@ standing history .
six months construction work , that is brutal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is constantly being bol@@ ted in the name of counter @-@ terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks , the Minister of Interior de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a thick security package .
but what does a debt status have to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say about all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the Com@@ promis@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they don &apos;t demand anybody .
other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I also take part in it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as Minister of the Interior , he was placed on results and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère has left a little time before he presents his conclusions for security in the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
some things are already known , announced , announced : that a new security agency should take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new .
not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU guidelines on passenger information and tru@@ ce law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère opens a second attempt for proposals which have not yet been made with the SPD : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ ck jihadi@@ sts with dual citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U ad@@ mits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , he considers this to be reasonable and does not demand anything that the coalition partner does not have any chance anyway .
a few new ideas are presented by the Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
they have partly in themselves : he plans quick procedures for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ecting men from deportation .
refugees who are specifically brought to the country should check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a safety review .
in the case of D@@ ul@@ ties for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse still worse than previously - such as commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of them are politically and legally sanc@@ tu@@ aries .
some are still un@@ exploited and leave questions open .
and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of tolerated , for example - raises the question : what does this have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the subjects of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be said that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in addition , many people were worried about security in view of the high numbers of refugees .
and things that people deeply engaged were not allowed to complain about in election times .
inner security is enormously concentrated in the focus .
first the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are electoral fights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the subject of internal security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past few days there was a high level between the two parties . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a gar@@ rison dispute about the equi@@ pping of the Federal Police , then on a security @-@ policy ideas collection of some Uni@@ ons Interior Ministers , in which the heads of the department also demand a bur@@ ka ban and a turning away from the dual citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère lab@@ ori@@ zes also here for irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able sounds .
he doesn &apos;t receive anything from a turn away from the double @-@ pass .
we have fixed the discussion in Germany .
to re@@ make it new is not sensible .
and with a bur@@ ka ban he had constitutional concerns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether its own package is constitu@@ tionally un@@ constitutional and whether it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the coalition partner , it only has to show itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a lot in it , which could cause disputes .
but the SPD is also trying to benefit from internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel merely sign@@ alizes cau@@ tious conversation and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen is still able to get off lightly .
despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als , the delivery numbers are rising worldwide .
but it is not in all markets around .
with the recall action , there are turbul@@ ations around a term .
Volkswagen is starting to continue in the second half of the year with deliveries of deliveries .
although Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can advance a plus over the course of the year , despite the diesel , thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
but in July , the core brand was weaker , especially in Western Europe , and thus poll@@ ed the total sales , as announced by the company in D@@ ax .
in July , the VW brand sold 1,@@ 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars to 1.8 percent less cars than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month .
in the home market Germany the deliveries declined by almost a sixth .
brand sales leader Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann brought the weaker figures out of July , especially at two sales stage less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there has been a purchase restra@@ int in some core markets through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the situation around the attempted coup attempt in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um also stressed the exit from the EU , explained a spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the USA , where the ab@@ at@@ ement was initially escal@@ ated , there is also a decrease of a minus .
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the mainly affected house brand of the Lower Saxony is further off lightly through the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months only an ex@@ tradition minus from 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available .
group sales director Fred Kap@@ pler was able to advance a sales figure from January to July .
Volkswagen supplied 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , worldwide 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated the software with a software .
in Germany alone , VW is calling around 2.5 million vehicles for retro@@ fitting to the workshops .
in the course of the retro@@ fitting VW reiter@@ ated that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the car park offers customers a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee certificate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after retro@@ fitting , but don &apos;t speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was in corporate circles on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is legal intri@@ c@@ acies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen is now granting its German customers a guarantee for fitted diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday .
from the ministry of transport it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fully met the requirements of my investigation commission and the KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deviations from these are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Federal Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has taken over the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power do not take place after retro@@ fitting and all type appro@@ vals relevant to the vehicle have remained unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was called in corporate circles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers come to a workshop for example half a year after the conversion - and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
even in the case of customer interest , it is important to avoid that any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust sc@@ andal may result in uncertainty as to possible warranty regulations , as it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that is why VW does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands heavy savers in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; bank manager Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposits or daily money accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Federal Association of German banks speaks of an individual case and does not see a signal in it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal austerity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would not have to be feared for their austerity measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
banks deposit money by night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay their 0.4 percent penalty .
the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund is asking for this fee from September of private and corporate customers for deposits over € 100,000 on sight deposits or daily money accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100.000 costs will cost 400 euros a year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for some time he be@@ ware 40 million euros , which could be withdrawn from one day to the other and which he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent of costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot put 4000 euros for every million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter @-@ pays principle , the cost is now further reduced .
to leave the cash in the bar of the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four attacks , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! , &quot; said the bank manager .
most customers had understanding and changed to other forms of investment .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the co @-@ operative association Bavaria explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to carry it alone is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically sustainable not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their account management fees , credit cards or bank transfers .
the Thurin@@ gian Folk and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael K@@ em@@ mer , chief executive of the Banking Union , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private clients to pay nationwide charges for deposits , so the competition in Germany is much too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said , on Lake T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a clientele that is a bit more lush . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if she &apos;s free of charge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , the cooperative bank G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
well @-@ known actors , sports@@ men and entrepreneurs are living in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; currently no other banks are known to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cooperative association of Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who charge a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the president of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banks und Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( Bv@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into the negative towards private customers is very , very high . &quot;
competition is tough , and it is threatening the emig@@ ration of investors to the competition .

destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys vinyl records ?
lon@@ es@@ ome middle @-@ aged men love plates .
this statement deri@@ ves from current data prior to submitting to the comment section . this statement deri@@ ves from current data under the pseud@@ onym of non @-@ Alle@@ gr@@ e men &apos;s medi@@ a@@ eval age .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the re@@ emergence of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in Mill@@ enni@@ als , which want to welcome the new@@ ness of physical objects , but to Mid@@ life @-@ no@@ stal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record are all fores@@ ight at the age of 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
it is also not a hormone by hob@@ by@@ ists - it has an emotional significance : older plate purch@@ as@@ ers retain their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote ?
if this blog would be a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest gray suit and wild@@ ly decorated before I stop , hold my hands and say something crazy like : &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even if the heart of Soh@@ o slowly cat@@ ches its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to evaluate their age and mind by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , by Si@@ ster Ray ( number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) into the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of data : eight men of middle age , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I already appreciate , &quot; he says .
I have about 3.000 or 4,000 records .
these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , the walls of his living room suffer .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records that he could not afford than they appeared and to buy items that he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought was too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agrees that those who buy boards are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend some time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink too much .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers he meets can apply to You@@ Go@@ v profile .
he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pe , people who heard about the com@@ eback and set themselves to buy their old records again .
from the conversations I have conducted , people usually have been dischar@@ ged from their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would explain the boom of tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the supposed emotional importance of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ onica , to realize that record stores have a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers took advantage of the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to pull back to the stability of familiar vinyl covers , of objects that evoke happy ju@@ gen@@ der@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s with me as a collector so I think it &apos;s so with many people .
it is a simple way to mentally deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like her social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a co @-@ worker fl@@ utes from a pile @-@ pile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record in the last month have not yet joined them .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player that they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record , don &apos;t own a record player .
at that time of the news report I would probably look very worried , while I smo@@ othing through a pile of Bos@@ sa Nova compil@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) has noticed a &quot; Tro@@ phy Asp@@ ect &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone recently came up here and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t possess a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead record , so that I can put it on the shelf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a big percentage but it definitely happens .
more produc@@ tively , less musi@@ cally .
we have people who say : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones , who are only slowly coming in .
F@@ opp , which has devoted almost a whole story to the vinyl records , has a colourful audience than I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and middle aged women .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the aforementioned businesses - Wild Be@@ asts latest synthes@@ izer and sex@@ box@@ ed pop in place of experimental jazz gro@@ aned from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks odd , but convincing psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are hard to imagine when standing next to someone 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of boards for sale .
it rather makes a shopping spre@@ e than a wholesale purchase .
it doesn &apos;t deserve much , so collecting plates is not a real option , it says .
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or other way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it drives off with a dil@@ uted si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of disk lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I am releasing the jeans Hot@@ pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who group around Pol@@ aro@@ id &apos;s cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter think about buying a crossover record player .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of panels of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one looks at them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative , some so far up that it is impossible to touch them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is pure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plate art . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items means more money for the industry and could send some customers into the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain .
it &apos;s no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates .
although my research has shown that the results of You@@ Go@@ v are right , they , at least in record shops in Soh@@ o , do not take into account the large number of female collectors who exist in reality , record shops and online forums .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with safety not stro@@ lling through the record shops of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while they avoid the gaz@@ ing look of an unc@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false present@@ er , who rises above the shoulders of middle @-@ aged men .
the Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai is the longest living verteb@@ rate - video surface

French Court re@@ jects offer about demoli@@ tion of shops in the jungle of refugee camps
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional stores and restaurants in the Cal@@ ais jungle where thousands of refugees live .
during a court hearing this week the authorities in Cal@@ ais concluded that the state should be authorized to sell 72 provisional deals in which persons within the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to En@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell , or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ecture argued that these places were to be demoli@@ shed because they would represent a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid and which have a fire and sanitary risk .
humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants were important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ backed association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also stated that the provisional stores and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a court in L@@ ille ruled that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who run the 72 provisional stores , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are absolutely understandable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that food shops , cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than just feeding people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas offer peaceful meeting between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places threatened by the decline was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is char@@ itable and 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian it meant that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be a disaster for these children , of which the youngest eight years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants rated on Friday that the number of people in the jungle lived up to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - following a steep increase of newcom@@ ers over the course of the summer .
despite Olympic dis@@ appointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant
despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing appearance at the Olympic season , Rad@@ pro@@ i Tony Martin didn &apos;t want to let him down .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I keep looking at the World Cup , stay confident and fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has no explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place in the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hon@@ estly say it &apos;s hard to comment on the past of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must analyze in cal@@ m@@ ness what reasons had led to the de@@ bac@@ le .
at the time driving world cup in October in Qatar , Martin wanted to fight for the title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll take a look at everything we &apos;ve changed lately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Be@@ am went to the start with his offer only in January and already has more than 100,000 users .
you can look at others while playing , but also intervene .
for example , they can give players suspen@@ sions and face enemies as well as provide equipment .
Activ@@ ision Bli@@ zz@@ ard is launching a new HD video service for the bo@@ oming world of e @-@ sports .
on the way to the global media event , Facebook should help .

here comes the reinforcement trailer
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation of velocity meters : in various federal states , among others in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flas@@ hes are being tested , which should be particularly effective .
the futur@@ istic reinforcement tra@@ ilers of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden , for example , can be used at accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on highway construction sites or to rehabil@@ itated bridges with temporary speed poli@@ sh@@ es , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with speed limits .
a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
the reinforcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days with un@@ interrupted measuring operation , the case data are transferred enco@@ ded over a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be captured over several tracks at the same time .
variable speed limits as well as access b@@ ans by time , lanes and vehicle class can also be monitored .
according to the manufacturer , the trailer can be moved in high @-@ traffic condition by car with trailer hit@@ ch .
so that it is not simply cl@@ apped , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and inci@@ dentally also sweat @-@ proof outer shell disappear .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to information by Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used .
foreign authorities also bl@@ itz with the new technology : recently France has ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 copies last year .
Britain catching silver in 7 @-@ star Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at the 7 @-@ star Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt on Thursday evening with the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were defeated in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the deci@@ bels Stadium .
Fi@@ ji gave a master class in handling , side @-@ qu@@ il@@ ting , back @-@ back , line @-@ run and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic med@@ als of any color .
the defeat was swe@@ pt through the not too bad con@@ sol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Great Britain on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back on them in the final .
but regardless of that Fi@@ ji could have beaten a 15 @-@ man team in this form .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for UK - but it will probably not - that at least a Brit@@ on tomorrow will have a gold medal for his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is boss trainer Ben R@@ yan , former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path behind it .
eight years ago , she lost every game with Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens in R@@ yan .
here they are lost only one .
this stage will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji began amaz@@ ingly and allowed the G@@ Bs to jump off from fun .
it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co. to run in driving coaches . the World Series winners went up 5 @-@ 0 to the top when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au was rus@@ hing around in the corner .
with still four minutes of playing time , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner he turned around .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
a humili@@ ating T@@ ackle of Mit@@ ch@@ ell pushed the mountain of man Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute , J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a went a touch down in the right corner and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the re@@ conn@@ aissance and there was still more than a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ alt@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ided by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and rus@@ hed to the line to make a goal .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it &apos;s as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB is still learning .
so it is also .
GB caused major changes to half time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for entire four minutes , which was good for the first half of the half until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova underwent a brilliant interim play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was long in favor of the South Se@@ as , whose fans sang , flags and d@@ anced on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds .
the whist@@ le rang , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ g@@ ged and GB ki@@ cked in the grass .
earlier on the day Fi@@ ji Japan had defeated Japan in the semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Great Britain pressed South Africa in a tight semi @-@ final match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the bu@@ cks forward in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late Tac@@ kl@@ ing by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the British 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the winning - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by battle with the trainer &apos;s cancer
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ inal gold than with these games , and that will mean something .
from the first stro@@ kes to the last 220 harsh H@@ ieve who go into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in her golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only those who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the Echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was present when they rowed to the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in the second without a tax @-@ woman , the first women in the history of British sports , who placed such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolute , after all , their 3@@ 9.@@ 000 in@@ ert deployment , which is also un@@ paralleled .
what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ ins that gli@@ de across the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the nature of the trium@@ ph@@ al .
behind every gold in the rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make a difference to the incre@@ mental advances that make the difference and there was no one more instrumental than the trainer who did not know if he was diagnosed with cancer this day .
as he said he was ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , which is operating and that did it .
if you don &apos;t do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky enough to start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum if that was the right term under such circumstances .
I needed money so I had to go better soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice .
that &apos;s how it starts .
rowing in itself is already a challenge , but this makes it an even bigger one .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory their first thoughts went to Williams who spent a nerve wre@@ cking morning doing something more than usual and trying to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ anning , which was the main man in the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . that &apos;s maybe something extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and also Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for exercising or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning didn &apos;t lose a race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with .
even in the last 500 metres , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to stop , p@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were very trapped in the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; pale in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not prepared to do something T@@ oll@@ es .
we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race we did .
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , reti@@ res . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for the large water producers .
this is what it meant some time ago in the original on a contribution of the Bavarian Radio .
a little later , the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia stran@@ gled the union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this , Rupert G@@ öller , who was 31 years old in the Ken@@ nel Association , stands for 28 years as Managing Director .
he was now retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , transports approximately 150@@ 000 cubic meters of water annually and supplies 32 places and ham@@ lets with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
member municipalities are the congregations of Kirch@@ hoff , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities .
the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ner Bürger@@ meister@@ in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Rupert G@@ öller was hired as a water @-@ keeper in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Cl@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 .
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organisational activities , budget@@ ary planning , calculation of fees and contributions to urgent questions on weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as an outstanding event , it called the inauguration and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the renovation of the high tanks ( 1999 ) , the creation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the partial renewal of water pipes .
there has been no stand@@ still and I have always received new additions , because water supplies life and drinking water is the most important food .
in their lau@@ dation , she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers loyal , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he used a lot of lif@@ eb@@ lo@@ od for his water @-@ purpose association and he lived quite well with the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the successful concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group for nit@@ rate reduction in front of the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district .
for this he received a lot of praise and praise .
Rupert G@@ öller , for his part , praised Water @-@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best aqu@@ al@@ keeper and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlight from his point of view , he described the well construction and the restructuring of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband .
however , the biggest challenge and the most difficult deployment were the pipe break at the high pressure tank at Kirch@@ hof on January 3 .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
also the supply of Neu@@ brunn can be maintained only once because one filled the high reservoir of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who joins the successor of Rupert G@@ öller .

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - A man shoots on a partner
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot his partner in a multi @-@ family home in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 pm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man called us and told us to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , after him , be made public .
now nationwide , because Sven S. could be travelling by car .
the man is about 1.@@ 80 feet tall , muscular , brown @-@ burned and has a G@@ lat@@ ze .
in the meantime , the police have published a photo of him .
it is however a couple of years old .
in the meantime , the husband is wearing a G@@ lat@@ ze .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon with him , such as the police .
anyone who sees Sven S. shall call the 110 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police talks about a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship at work &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was born 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 .
at first , the competent police in Lü@@ beck did not want to give any information on the Ta@@ ther@@ or or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims ; however , it confirmed that a human being had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing principle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say more at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special command mand@@ o ( SE@@ K ) was at the crime scene .
steel - Licht@@ blick for the German Steel Industry
the crisis @-@ packed and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions of dollars .
financial burdens that the industry threatened from green electricity subsidies are from the table .
it remains with the release of the renewable energy revolution in the existing systems for so @-@ called own power production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday issue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really glad that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly , the European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel producers who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a statement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators are replaced in the steel mills , an EEG change of 20 percent will affect .
but even this is not raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on the electricity generation .
as a result , the status quo of the current regulation is largely as@@ cer@@ tained .
the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have special significance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steel is Future &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of emissions legislation , climate and employment targets are to be weigh@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IG Metall chief Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe suffers from over@@ capacity and a considerable price pressure .
last year the situation continued to ag@@ grav@@ ate when the world &apos;s largest producer of producing China threw a massive steel on the world market in the face of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturers acc@@ use price dump@@ ing Chinese steel companies .
in the course of this spring , the situation has eased a little more relaxed .
on the one hand , import duties have been imposed on import @-@ steel effects , on the other hand , the economic prospects in China have increased .
it is not clear how sustainable the price recovery is .
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ rupp ar@@ rests cau@@ ti@@ ously on Thursday .
last but not least , prices would have stagn@@ ated .
the industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp finally did not want to exclude the closing of individual works .
around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
in July , the German steel producers are cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the same period of the previous year , such as the steel economic union on Friday .
after a short increase in May the crowd went back for the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with an increase in output .
community , spirit , health : singing is good for sen@@ iors
singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp for her entire life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , she taught music in the school choir , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; sing me - emo@@ tionally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall lively , she says .
by the way , she does something good for her health and spirit .
since singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors , Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler says by the German sen@@ iors division .
most senior citizens sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like @-@ minded people , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular interaction , sen@@ iors can establish and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family structures dissolve in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organize , to be able to rely on others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
for in doing so , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly demand his lungs are not so quickly out of the pu@@ ff in everyday life .
even if it comes to obtaining the sound of voice in old age , singing is an ideal hobby .
for elderly people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Association of senior citizens .
in the older generations the common singing had a much higher significance , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people ar@@ ouses many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their adol@@ escence .
due to lyrics and especially melodies , people with dementia are sin@@ king into long @-@ lying events .
in singing , the head also requires a special power , explains L@@ enz .
to concentrate simultaneously on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt oneself to the other singers - that &apos;s a major cognitive challenge .
just elderly people who live alone are practicing not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition you hear through singing in the choir , H@@ ac@@ kler says .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ esteem is also growing through singing in the choir .
to show yourself : if I practise for something long , I will get better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start singing , so there is enough .
if you want to try a new hobby , don &apos;t hesitate , even if you think you have little talent , L@@ enz says .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who hears when a sound comes next to it ?
in search of the right offer , senior citizens have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir , one can easily join .
many cities also offer views of the choirs in the surrounding area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the church leader directly .
many senior choirs can also be found via the internet .
those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbors for help with the internet research .
those who want to sing should necessarily join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to all ages .
cats react sensi@@ tively as han@@ go@@ vers on scre@@ aming of young animals
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover , what effect the calls of cat bab@@ ys to adult animals has .
to their surprise the mi@@ cks also did not let the males cold - however , they beha@@ ved in contrast to the females always the same .
female cats can recognize the excitement of cat bab@@ ys at the mi@@ cks of the little ones .
they react at ten percent faster to sounds of k@@ itt@@ ens , who are in great need , as scientists have found out of the Veter@@ inary University and the Hannover Medical School ( M@@ H@@ H ) .
cats also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evi@@ dently the acoustic differences between mi@@ str@@ ust of less and heavily stir@@ red up for the males either are not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the M@@ H@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
in a previous study , the research team has already found out that the duration and pitch of the caus@@ al cri@@ es differ with the ur@@ gency of their dependency .
a total of nine adult males and eight female females were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the M@@ H@@ H .
they were played for a reputation of little ones who were taken out of the throw box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens , which were additionally raised .
the researchers maintain their results in spite of the small sample for meaningful results .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who haven &apos;t had their own offspring , re@@ acted to the cri@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned faster to the loudspeaker when this calls of the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens played .
this ability may be inn@@ ate or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males actually re@@ acted , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist .
in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men to baby no@@ ises in humans .
some studies also showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to infants , regardless of whether they were already mothers or not , the bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ sky acc@@ esses &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r is a soccer legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant has been issued against the former soccer star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r in Turkey .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the attempted put@@ sch , another important football match takes place in Turkey .
before the du@@ el of the arch@@ rival between Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Kon@@ ya Super@@ cup , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
even when the state of emergency was handed down after the attempted coup attempt in July , the government , the everyday life of ordinary citizens , should not be com@@ promised .
this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the attempted put@@ sch attempt .
it is not even possible to stop football in front of football .
against the former star@@ fish Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r , the prosecution issued an arrest warrant .
accordingly , South America living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ kü@@ r is to be a follow@@ er of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is bl@@ amed for the attempted put@@ sch by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an .
although the state of emergency is still valid for 90 days until October , indeed , this has no effect on the life of the majority of Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Erd@@ og@@ an has declared the ni@@ ghtly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on public places throughout the country on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is like the whole country - divided in followers and opponents of Erd@@ og@@ an .
especially fans of the workers &apos; club Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
but what unites the Gro@@ s of the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ sch .
even the fans agree - no matter whether their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it will be especially interesting for Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as the top scor@@ er of his club .
in the final game against Fen@@ er@@ bah@@ ce he achieved the 1 : 0 victory hit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an outstanding way and secured the tro@@ phy to his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found an irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the round @-@ kno@@ ck in the Champions League , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go out early in the Europa League . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Sü@@ per Li@@ g it was only sixth .
the season was not good .
the tro@@ phy was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we managed it and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as , the year was better .
above all thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who laid the basis for the 14th song as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ cker king with 26 season @-@ figures as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ sni@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig .
this is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
at the same time , the Gom@@ ez bor@@ rowed at the AC Florence under contract and made known to Bes@@ i@@ kt@@ as after the attempted coup attempt , not to return due to the political situation in the country after his European holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he just has to say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the specialist magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club chief Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in order to do this , the stri@@ ker must be ready to for@@ ego about a third of his annual fee amounting to 7.5 million euro , Or@@ man stated clearly : &quot; we cannot pay his salary in Florence . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have med@@ als chances at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers Julia Step@@ an@@ ova may not start in Rio .
other convic@@ ted athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for med@@ als .
the topic of dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics in Rio .
the Russian float in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , who filed her start right before the games after a dop@@ ing lock , was plu@@ cked out mer@@ cil@@ essly at her start ( 100 meters of breast ) and rested .
it was a sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le scene : with a raised smile she was still in the hall and provoked her performance .
as a celeb@@ r@@ ity that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a j@@ ub@@ el@@ strom .
but there are numerous other sports@@ men who go to the start despite the dop@@ ing past at the Olympic Games in Rio .
here &apos;s an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he had already been locked two times because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since its spell the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds and is considered the greatest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ An@@ n F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to wait for a six @-@ month lock after having been proven to take the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
she had severe too@@ th@@ ache after surgery , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old was defending herself .
Sandra Per@@ ko@@ vic ( disc@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 , the Olympic champion of 2012 , world champion from 2013 and European champion from 2010 to 2016 has been positively tested on the For@@ bidden stimul@@ ant agent Meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine .
Per@@ ko@@ vic denied boarding and was blocked for six months .
the four biggest lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great gold fav@@ ori@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , was positively tested in 2010 and closed for 21 months .
a remedy for penis enlargement was responsible , stepped Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 meters .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ throwing , Belarus ) : hardly any ath@@ lete was subsequently recognized as many med@@ als afterwards .
thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after he was diagnosed with testosterone dop@@ ing .
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to release Olympic @-@ Silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the European title in 2006 for testosterone mis@@ use .
he was also awarded the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games , due to a judgement of the International Sports Court , CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he ranks second in the world rank@@ ings .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km of walking , China ) : the world record holder and gold fav@@ ori@@ tin was first tested in May , but may still start in Rio .
during the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion@@ ships were found evidence of taking a forbidden dietary supplement , the lock of the world @-@ anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell mil@@ der and ran already on 13 July .
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian viol@@ ates - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Department of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday .
she suffered cuts and had been treated at the hospital , but I have already left it .
she planned her home journey for the beginning of September .
whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon , Austrian citizens are also still unclear .
the State Department is in constant contact with local authorities , such as liqu@@ or .
Hu@@ a H@@ in , located about 200 kilometres south of Bangkok &apos;s capital , was initially explo@@ ding two bombs on Thursday evening .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning , two explo@@ sives went up again , and another person was killed according to the authorities .
Ph@@ u@@ ket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning .
during the det@@ onation in the vicinity of the popular seaside resort Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured after police data .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , which killed an urban cler@@ k .
according to the authorities in a bou@@ quet of flowers , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in front of the Re@@ vier of the Co@@ ast@@ al Police .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast called for several wounded in Ch@@ um@@ phon on the south @-@ east coast .
from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks carry the same signature , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Army General Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning in front of journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is too early to express oneself on possible motives - but probably it is about the actions of Muslim rebels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern typical for the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist insurrection movement or international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather , it is assumed that the bombs were imposed by opponents of the ruling military j@@ un@@ ta .
in recent days , the authorities would have kept secret evidence of forthcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they did not have been informed of the exact time and locations .
it is still unclear which group is st@@ aking behind the stro@@ kes .
the police showed their officials throughout the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand there are still smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but mostly they are not against tourists .
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace built over the years by King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the bomb explo@@ sions available , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no need for necessary trips to these provinces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution dra@@ fted by the military j@@ un@@ ta .
this gives the military considerable influence over the coming years .
Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to stal@@ k may@@ hem while the country moves towards stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody un@@ rest , resist@@ ed itself to restore the kingdom to stability and order .
however , it is not possible for the military to get a grip on the insur@@ rec@@ tionary uprising of Muslim rebels for years in the ou@@ ter@@ most south of the country .
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago , in Bangkok , a stop at a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine was killed 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack on the country &apos;s younger history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several national offices , the constitu@@ tion@@ ers in the Con@@ federation have also placed the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &apos; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &apos; clu@@ es for efforts against the free democratic constitution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Constitutional Commissioner Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , immigrants of Islamic faith or the Middle East are being diff@@ used in an extrem@@ ist way .
therefore we observe the movement as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is directed against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multic@@ ultural &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
constitu@@ tionally protected in nine Bundes@@ länder - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - observe the &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ eres . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ate said that his authority was closely aligned with the local offices during the decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; groups like the &apos; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &apos; attempt to pick up their target group where they stand , &quot; said the Constitutional Court .
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
that would be Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a real advertising for one &apos;s own thing .
propaganda should appeal to people emo@@ tionally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , there were reports of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contacts to Af@@ D politicians from several German states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ate said , he had no knowledge of that .
for the constitutional review , possible contacts of this type are only relevant at a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , changes their direction and becomes more extreme .
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
with a view of the substantial increase in legitimate criminal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ ate said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context .
but we have noticed in recent years that there can be right @-@ frozen structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
it may well be that other right @-@ frozen groups or small groups form , plan attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extre@@ mis@@ tic motives .
however , a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide control of rec@@ tification @-@ terrorism is not recognizable .
the previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks .
he expressed concerns about the fact that many attacks went to the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene .
this is the wor@@ rying thing .
many of the susp@@ ects in attacks on asylum accommodation had not previously been known as criminals , politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed crimes previously left with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts who perhaps were politically in@@ different or elected for example , CD@@ U , SPD or left , which , however , have radic@@ alised by far @-@ right wing extre@@ mis@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
the Olympic Games or World Records not always determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro .
at the Aqu@@ atics Center the slightly over@@ weight float from Ethiopia is so slow that it was temporarily no longer visible in the TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ asit was subsequently turned into a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his lead with a back@@ log of 48 seconds and took the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not just sporty figure that drew the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old took part in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian received a special start @-@ up from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming more popular in under@@ represented countries .
since most sports@@ men run in Ethiopia , Hab@@ asit did not want to do something else .
preparation is everything : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media referred to it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ bel of W@@ hale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in reference to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosperity boy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was fun with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only struck at a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter open @-@ style , played no role .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i run the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney for media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the flo@@ ater from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete in a conc@@ entri@@ c run over 100 metres of fre@@ estyle .
f@@ ren@@ e@@ tically M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old at that time learned to swim eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

Tru@@ mp does not see the im@@ pending election defeat so close
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp is speaking at an election campaign in Florida .
should there be nothing with the election to the US president , Donald Tru@@ mp already has an alternative video .
he then goes on holiday .
if Donald Tru@@ mp loses the US presidential election in November , it wouldn &apos;t matter to him : &quot; ultimately it will either collapse , or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a phone interview with the US TV channel CN@@ BC .
if it does not suff@@ ice for him for reasons of political correctness , this is al@@ right , said Tru@@ mp .
thus he called the US President Barack Obama and the nom@@ in@@ ee of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) .
last but not least , within his party more and more resistance formed .
post is entering retail with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies in the vehicle is obviously great .
the post is planning to sell her electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter .
in the near future , the Group intends to start trading with the transpor@@ ter .
the post office will also offer its electric transpor@@ ters on the free car market from the coming year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to enter into the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for months , the company has been testing whether they are to sell their self @-@ developed Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter with which letters and pack@@ ets are delivered , even to other companies .
post @-@ President Jürgen Ger@@ des had said that there will always be inquiries about arti@@ sans .
following information from the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group plans to enter the mass production of the vehicles shortly .
in post @-@ production production , the company is planning to build up to 10,000 cars per year and layer .
Ger@@ des announced that the Group wanted to increase its fleet of electric cars significantly and long @-@ term a complete change@@ over to environmentally friendly vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we are setting up the complete fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter is active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
GF@@ RP guided tour ki@@ cks off after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges its boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the returns came suddenly - but not surprisingly .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K affir@@ med that the chair of Chief Executive Officer Matthias Hart@@ mann will be all the more uns@@ af@@ e the longer the success promised by him .
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : following new dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ ignation of the company management , the world &apos;s number five is faced with a new beginning .
G@@ RP Executive Board wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Supervisory Board , Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert , already dischar@@ ges from the supervisory committee with effect from September 12 .
as of September 1 , the management board of the Executive Board will take over the previous board member Gerhard Haus@@ jer@@ inger , divided the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shall officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CEO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until a successor has been found for Hart@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the long @-@ term business policy orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details wanted to not call a spokes@@ man on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who will be the market research company in the future , is still unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in An@@ le@@ ger@@ schen it was said on Friday , at the shareholders , last but not least , the dis@@ appointment about the continued success of the restructuring measures initiated years ago would have been great .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been working on the Gf@@ K summit since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business figures , every shareholder will be rest@@ less at some point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that would be the case with BMW , that would make the Qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
following set@@ backs in the previous quarters , the Company failed to stop its loss in the second quarter of 2016 .
with € 36@@ 1.2 million , sales were up 6.1 percent lower than the same period of the previous year .
in the first half of the year , sales fell by 3.4 per cent with 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million euros .
in view of its difficult economic situation , the profit in the second quarter was primarily imp@@ acted by the uns@@ ur@@ passed value of the company .
the company depreci@@ ation of 139 million euros , which had become necessary in the Consumer Experience segment , resulted in a loss of € 14@@ 8.2 million from the Group .
in the second quarter of 2015 , Gf@@ K had generated a net income of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - Bus sli@@ ps into cru@@ mb@@ ones in dit@@ ch : eight wounded
at an accident of a travel with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n ( district of Aur@@ ich ) .
two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries , the police informed them .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to yield her information to an accommo@@ dating truck which partly drove on the counter @-@ road .
the bus desc@@ ended right from the road and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , like a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; because of the location of the bus , people were not able to leave the bus alone , &quot; she said .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and a emergency ambul@@ ance came to the accident site at Landes@@ straße 2 .
the un@@ injured travellers were brought back from a regular bus to the Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ ner district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators demanded the load experience and possible witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cubic metre of waste water amount to 3,@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros for the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / World Green@@ sh@@ ank 3.@@ 44 euro ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 euros ( previously 2,@@ 18 Euro ) .
at the facility in Az@@ endorf , the wastewater fee will then increase once more , if appropriate improvement measures are needed .
after an over@@ lap calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf will be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , at the approval of the budget Kul@@ mb@@ ach noted that for these san@@ itation systems under@@ cover works .
due to legal bases , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the systems cost @-@ effectively .
as of October 1 , 2016 , the citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from World Green@@ wich Village , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to reach deeper into the pur@@ se .
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Head of Administration Herbert Schmidt showed up the body , a new calculation of fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary .
in the period between October 2016 and September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ cover from the previous calendar period will also be compensated .
Schmidt founded the serious fee increases with the fact that there were relatively small facilities at all three se@@ wer@@ age facilities with a very low waste water attack , which was between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
for example , expendi@@ tures for the necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact on the basis of the low distribution basis .
in addition , sewage flow in all three plants is slightly declining .
furthermore , refur@@ bish@@ ment and repair expenses were considerably reduced in all three plants due to their age of renovation and repair .
the facility in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the plants for th@@ igh@@ s , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years .
Schmidt proved that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage in the Az@@ endorf sewage plant .
at the water pumping station , the nearly 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led and the first sewage pond had to be extended after almost 20 years of operation , the sewage slu@@ dge was dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation option had to be installed in order to meet the water @-@ legal requirements in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these extraordinary expenses came from the continued maintenance and maintenance costs , which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which in the previous year 2011 / 2012 were considerably below the current level .
Stein@@ meier made it clear that in the three plants , the expenses for operation and maintenance were &quot; full of sm@@ ashing &quot; in the three plants .
in the past 20 years , Schmidt , the market town of large entertainment costs , has been spar@@ ed .
the situation for the aforementioned facilities will continue to remain prec@@ arious due to stone houses , particularly since the supply area of the Fri@@ esen@@ bach@@ tal wastewater @-@ purpose association could not be extended by these facilities , because it is concerned with defici@@ ent institutions .
Bulgaria accounts for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % were recorded .
the average annual rainf@@ all of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured by the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10.5 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , a price increase in the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison with the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; different goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0,1 % ) .
prices remained as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; effect as Asian carto@@ on@@ ist critic@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its filtering tool , Sn@@ ap@@ chat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that already borders the absur@@ dity .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are non @-@ blo@@ ated , self @-@ contained tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day .
all mis@@ steps reach the public .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have drawn criticism in the past where they were accused of using the app Black@@ face promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week suggested a filter to some users who gave them sli@@ t @-@ eyes , false teeth and dark@@ er che@@ eks , some critics call a rac@@ ist cartoon by Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow @-@ face . &quot;
they asked themselves if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity .
the news and indign@@ ation were widely spread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , one day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat announced that it would have de@@ activated the feature .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was thought to be an homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of inj@@ uri@@ ous c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani wrote , a Korean @-@ American art student whose tweet was widely used across the photos that the filter was &quot; hur@@ t@@ ful and &quot; uncomfortable . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the ju@@ x@@ tap@@ osition of a very contradic@@ tory Asian carto@@ on@@ ist and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ proof , but that the yellow @-@ face has been moved to the ej@@ ecting extrem@@ ity .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stum@@ bling kite .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand .
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are more diverse in the breed than their older counter@@ parts - could rather assume that sensitivity is expected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats creates a picture that is insul@@ ting for a user , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed than it was before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said K@@ atie Z@@ hu the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie in an interview on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an essay for media and in a phone interview , she said that they believe that racial @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity among the recruitment practices in Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the largely white , only male leadership and ended her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that has left Sn@@ ap@@ chat mostly un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures for the diversity of its staff and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , Sn@@ ap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a subscri@@ ber , the company recently hired a personnel responsible , focusing on subordin@@ ate population groups and internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu said that she will leave her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users than us to say that it is not O.@@ K. . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military leadership fal@@ si@@ fies IS@@ IS secret service information , establishes committee of Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence official information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , when it had allowed the actual states on site to report a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can members of the army committee , intelligence agencies and the army budget , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , briefly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence information that was typically clas@@ sed by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders regularly drew a more positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism when the actual conditions had been allowed on site and were consistently positive than analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; an article cited the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at the Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presented Ken Cal@@ vert , republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management errors in the Cent@@ Com range to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed consistent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence that government tips under Obama have given instructions to change reports , it shows how analysts exposed to pressure from their superi@@ ors , an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before the Congress were much more positive than the facts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com has publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ su@@ l , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the Central Command Points changed the intelligence reports to play down the threat of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force into life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings during the investigation .
in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defense .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 and 2015 , the Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the high @-@ ranking democr@@ at in the committee , Adam B. Schiff , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damaged mor@@ als among analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave exc@@ essively low space for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of any intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ Com analysts regarding a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certain political opinion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon General In@@ spec@@ tor , who were in@@ filtr@@ ated by Cent@@ Com analysts .
l@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon press spokesperson , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on any reports of the Congress , while the investigations of the General In@@ spec@@ tor are still in progress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also admitted that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data , and that intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these key issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a statement made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , last year &apos;s accus@@ ations have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of dis@@ agreements of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , a piece of writing about how the then government under George W. Bush , contrary to the recommendations of many analysts , only fores@@ aw a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker stated that contrary to the government statements of the government , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the terrorist group &apos;s financial situation , since these provisional refin@@ eries would have been put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
however , this recognition was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s &apos;s military commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature because of its dispro@@ portion@@ ately positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the USA win fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with the UK stands before
one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said that she couldn &apos;t remember that she had ever done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am not one of the people who keep their goals in mind .
however , they know that : the American women are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , who remain unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final round of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will get the first and second place in their group from six teams .
the first placed will take a little longer for the strong Dutch woman to lead the other group .
as always the game might go out on Saturday , the American women have triggered a surprising confusion by their success story , four years after they ended up in the past London Games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey s@@ layer in hands ( her two older sisters played sports at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became National Player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
they missed the Olympics in 2008 , as they could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 , in which for her and her team everything went wrong .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , became a coach of the National Team , and thus the things began to turn to a better one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we did not have the work@@ load in London that we now have .
we have been able to pull the ru@@ dder completely .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the door@@ way in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the near area .
India was gone without a victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the play from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into her hands .
she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and le@@ ap@@ ed the ball into the gate to give the female a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the US , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a barrel .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .
in the middle of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , as late as it is , it is the Olympic Games .
the Rio de Janeiro &quot; events feel constantly and inevitably , a fast relay race between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself would be a burning rod , which is passed from the w@@ rist@@ band to the swi@@ mmer to the tur@@ ner for tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour &apos;s conversation in the coffee shop without listening to Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ decker or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s black with dimples , could well have been among those known names that would be sent to Prime Time , if he were a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ asts , or even fen@@ c@@ ers .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the olymp@@ ic trampoline .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
further from the center , partly in the shade are the sports which are not universally recognized : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast @-@ swimming and may it reign for a long time .
but if I want to make a modest argument for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it made its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years have been so spar@@ se that many people I questioned didn &apos;t know that there is at all an Olympic Port .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to the competition , there has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and until 2012 had won an ath@@ lete that made it to the final .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal this year from London .
the trampoline jumping has a certain out@@ sider character , partly because it sounds more suitable for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school as the one for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an experienced enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ ors of his never ending impact - but also the gra@@ ci@@ ousness of the gymn@@ asi@@ um and diving , the two sports that essentially unites it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spring@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
emerging conqu@@ er@@ ors jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to turn a number of falling movements ( turning , fen@@ cing and sal@@ ting ) before they land on their feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the official &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Olympic programme &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; they are evaluated according to performance , difficulty level and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the common Olympic vector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts in their quest for gold have to go further , faster , up and down , sometimes to the finish , sometimes down and down , upwards and down@@ wards at the playground .
they not only ch@@ ase the finish line or the output wall , but also in tel@@ ev@@ ised broadcasting a further higher goal : die Welt oder des Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ords .
the goal @-@ oriented pursuit is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it &apos;s enough to even stir one spect@@ ator into tears .
but it is also what I feel somewhat tired when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a breathing break .
the vector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she jumps off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly back up .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be .
the qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final rounds as part of a afternoon block from 14@@ .00 .
amid the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in the general tur@@ mo@@ il .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the fear and objec@@ tification of male athletes - as the male U.S. gymn@@ asts recently proposed , according to The Wall Street Journal - Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan base .
&quot; one generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long is an ally of the USA
violent protests in Ethiopia
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demonstr@@ ators call for political changes in Ethiopia hit the government &apos;s violent resistance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
witnesses say that the police killed dozens of prot@@ esters during clas@@ hes with the police .
is Ethiopia exactly inter@@ rupt ?
in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but over the past few months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and spread more and more areas .
last week thousands of people rus@@ hed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organizations , the government &apos;s response was cruel .
witnesses testified that polic@@ emen shot and killed dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
in circulation , videos about the protests , probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security guards beat young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a hand against a wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the UN Human Rights Council demands a thorough investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to combat terrorist haz@@ ards across the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if ever , get so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital of Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have consistently led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , and dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or prison , killed or driven into the expan@@ se of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and do not have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ You@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth protests .
a generation is prot@@ esting .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gl@@ ehold over the power of the ruling coalition .
after a far critici@@ zed election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time , tensions continue along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front , or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den , have been forced more or less forced in recent years to use the tur@@ mo@@ il and re @-@ arm themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness are now explo@@ ded under the surface under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media as cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the internet services improved .
even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies hiding where they are .
several young Ethiop@@ ians admitted that they gathered themselves to protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons , the Am@@ us@@ as , coming from ae@@ th@@ op@@ ia predominantly Christian high@@ lands , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy as they exploited the Oro@@ mos , many of which are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas .
but this is also changing .
&quot; we are there to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under a umbrella , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ mos@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos .
the biggest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is stran@@ gely dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was until his death on an un@@ published illness in 2012 for 17 years in Ethiopia &apos;s Prime Minister .
he was seen as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to manipul@@ ate opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively obsc@@ ure reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia had experienced such tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 , after thousands of elections prot@@ ested , which according to information provided by analysts were apparently blocked by the government and subsequently stolen .
during the subsequent ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if they were less than in the last months and that time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in fighting poverty .
but obviously , this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ conception of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous eth@@ ni@@ cal form .
last month the prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ per@@ ian city , of Tig@@ ray managed businesses and the hatred towards the Tig@@ ray is becoming more common in the social media .
analysts say that the protests put the US and other Western allies in a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights to neighboring Somalia , even though it has recently concluded that it has closed this base .
while the West is clearly wanting to support democracy , it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Ab@@ di said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin line of congratulations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp declared Obama &apos;s claim to IS@@ IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tru@@ mp tried to disp@@ el the last controversy surrounding his campaign by ang@@ ling that his repeated claim , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton would have been the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious .
this clari@@ fication raised new questions about the communications capabilities of the Republi@@ can candidate candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public .
it also brings its comrades who try to take care of him during an event@@ ful phase , in the peculiar position to explain what he could not have meant .
after he had made the suggestion at an electoral campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp broke back in relation to the claim on Thursday and insist@@ ed that he really did not intend to interpret , the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp said he was just sar@@ c@@ astic .
the T@@ we@@ et was contrary to the previous day Mr. Tru@@ mp told in a series of interviews , he meant the accus@@ ation very serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ orph@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tru@@ mp wanted to weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate wanted to know nothing about it .
the last storm of criticism rus@@ hed down on Mr. Tru@@ mp , while trying to direct the focus of his campaign due to falling demand values to the economic situation .
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Mich@@ ig@@ an this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp tried to return to this subject again .
on Twitter he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he drew strong criticism when he said the Russians should h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but he later said , &quot; Of course , I said sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then back to demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans , how they arrive , and then &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert that ob@@ serves the language of both candidates .
but I think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tru@@ mp adopted an even more et@@ ched note , as his survey values continued to decline .
a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist published on Friday showed a leading lead in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tru@@ mp tries not to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he frequently acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or to mis@@ understand his hum@@ our .
but while strengthening the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s sciss@@ ors have brought his loyal associates into the uncomfortable situation to stand to him , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp@@ s most prominent advoc@@ ates , gave himself great trouble to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani about the correctness of Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had established the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this sense , it is true that before Obama , IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them am@@ bushes , completely wrong , and so it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream rep@@ ublic@@ ans are trying to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State , allowed IS@@ IS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control .
prior to the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and accused them of running around on each of his words against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mo@@ cked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts trying to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats mo@@ cked Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s sorry for a further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
once upon the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point comes back
Ver@@ b Cafe was a sk@@ inn@@ y café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which didn &apos;t have Wi @-@ Fi , but served good coffee for 15 years .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front were ou@@ sted .
soap Cher@@ ie shop , sold in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local people smo@@ ked it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is excluded and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York is a change , then it is also new invention .
a rev@@ ital@@ ised Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new club has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a client offered him to provide funds for a new exterior , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot of things .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so machine .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ nis@@ hes such as cap@@ ers and sau@@ te onions .
there are natural keys .
the café doesn &apos;t serve beer anymore , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also displaced by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a client .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg in the past and regularly visited the club .
even after having moved to Green@@ point , she would take the path .
after the verb was closed , she gave up the coffee drinking for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it became clear to me that it was at the coffee and the culture in the verb that was right to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee , even if she ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea in place of her usual i@@ ced coffee , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the club in 2003 .
he went there before the work and inevitably ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing B@@ agel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
today Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing B@@ agel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had no res@@ ent@@ ment in the fact that the soap business occupied the old business area .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered a special soap for clubs with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the café as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go on their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish residents Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu card into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he has prepared to leave it soon so that his new neighbors will feel welcome .
the location also has further advantages .
a local juice bar would like to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee in the bottle .
there is a chance that the café is expanded to a neighboring building .
for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favorites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a charter customer and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and the Order felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a rich meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascension to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a gourmet , President Roosev@@ elt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on that day was a bit more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to Americans as they should eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acted by Chinese cuisine in the U.S. , while Bri@@ ck@@ man told in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about living in a residential house on the Lower East Side from the perspective of the food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a re@@ porter in the Eisen@@ berg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , snow@@ y snack at Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
Bri@@ ck@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable dishes ate .
when the re@@ porter ordered min@@ ced meat , this was the couple for a discussion about the food in the era of the Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and p@@ opp@@ y bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating as many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as a dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ inning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cooked for male fel@@ ine and it was served freshly baked past@@ ed for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; records the ways with which the country per@@ ished to no longer be the land of land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when eating for Americans was a central , ten@@ se issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as ten@@ se was the new budget : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le food , the c@@ asser@@ ol@@ le recovered as a &quot; wonderful way to restore food residue , &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man noted , as chefs were able to hide un@@ appe@@ ti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced with cheap dried fruit .
meat , which was the centre of American cuisine for many years , became a rare ser@@ ene luxury .
unique bl@@ ends have been tried since a cal@@ orie rich and nour@@ ishing satisfaction pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ses the taste or even a healthy kitchen @-@ sense .
during their research for the book that includes recipes , Bri@@ ck@@ man prepared a dish from that time , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular additive at noon , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ziegel@@ man continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the house business recipes .
as never before or since , H@@ ous@@ ehold Econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - helped shape the country &apos;s eating habits .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ wives &quot; and the challenge to convert p@@ light like cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a feast of historical delicacies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
particularly tasty are the reports on the government &apos;s response to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ eating posture .
while publicly praised the simple I@@ owa peasant &apos;s kitchen of his kitchen , he sp@@ ed like the million @-@ million man of the world he became .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was truly alien to reality .
President Roosev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or asked him to make an ex@@ clamation with his stomach .
as described in the book , the hire of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors of Mrs. Roosev@@ elt added that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ted ones . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with food , was dis@@ car@@ ded as soon as the country returned to the legs .
the legacy of our continued focus on calories and food , Bri@@ ck@@ man said , as well as how science was applied to food .
the couple had better understood the eating habits of Bri@@ ck@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law when writing the book - for example , how they could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of wa@@ sting food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ziegel@@ man remembered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They really made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the incident of the wind .
after the plates were cleared at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e produced a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert that President Roosev@@ elt ate for lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bri@@ ck@@ man and added that it was a common trick to miss a fancy recipe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no beaten cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone sw@@ ells a bit reluc@@ t@@ antly a spoon in the teeth , brown gli@@ b@@ bers .
amaz@@ ingly , it did not taste bad .
Co@@ E won three times a set@@ back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do bud@@ er , he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Some chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life in the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others &apos; lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; White Helm@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a civil protection group , which according to Bild @-@ Zeitung had so far saved 6@@ 0,000 people alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
29@@ 00 volunteers set their own lives in order to draw people out of bom@@ bed houses and to make first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civil guard , showing him at an 11 hour rescue of a baby from the rub@@ ble of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians a shining symbol in the horror of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as a hero , he never saw himself , said according to the picture : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the real ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I die in saving life , I think that God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have dropped four barrel bombs over the Alz@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now remove the toxic remains of the bomb so that no children play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quotes his final words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks usually only come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to go back to the sea after an examination on board the research vessel S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats over the North Atlantic with a good 1 km / h until today .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ h@@ arks will only receive offspring with 150 years of age .
lei@@ surely the Greenland shar@@ k swi@@ ms along the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean , in an hour it is on average just 1.@@ 220 meters far .
only when it matters , the five meter long animal acceler@@ ates to a full 2,@@ 6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
this lifestyle dominated by slow@@ ness , however , seems to be a god@@ send for a high age .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at least of a Greenland shar@@ k that could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock describes this life @-@ span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the evolutionary bi@@ ologist assumed for a long time that Greenland became st@@ on@@ est .
only lack@@ ed the evidence .
Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks are hard to observe , finally they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually only appear on the surface only in the winter .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks .
they measured their slow motion when they stopped six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
nevertheless , in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
they may ch@@ ase sleeping animals or pat@@ rolling at the bottom of the polar sea and look for cad@@ a@@ vers that sw@@ ung out of higher water @-@ layers down .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland , fishermen between 2010 and 2013 brought to Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as a by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the biggest 50@@ 2 cen@@ timeter was measured .
in order to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens nucle@@ us of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens already arises before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins in it are later no longer renewed .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons attempts to lo@@ osen large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the third @-@ smallest animal with a length of 220 centimet@@ ers , the lens nucle@@ us contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , which is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in its investigation in 2012 .
all larger Greenland ha@@ ils had normal carbon @-@ 14 @-@ amounts in their lens nucle@@ us , which is created by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 years for a 4@@ 93 @-@ cen@@ timeter @-@ long Greenland shar@@ k , while the record @-@ shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers could be 3@@ 92 years old .
that Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai @-@ females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers of the length could assign an old age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and his age was determined with 156 years , Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie with the multip@@ lication obviously can be at least one and a half centuries time .
this should also be a world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ uses live mainly in icy waters is no accident .
the previous record holder , a 211 year old Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ w@@ al , in whose bac@@ on on the neck a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on point , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the living animals often runs on a flame .
so they mature later - and age slower .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often very large .
for the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives therefore more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very large animal should , on the other hand , invest its resources into a long life .
building ground in a double pack
with topics relating to building , the council has focused on the recent meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the Board accepted the communication by Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the recently reported residential areas can start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the property , par@@ cel@@ isation and registration questions were clari@@ fied and the applications could be made for survey , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; street &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( Bin@@ der@@ straße - extension section 1 ) is no longer in the way to interested parties .
the municipal council is convinced that the land areas in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au appeal to young families and elderly sen@@ iors alike .
as it was said , Bau@@ consent can immediately report to the Town Hall , the municipal council is expected to advise on the allocation of the plots in its September session .
in order to further en@@ quiries concerning the establishment of further commercial enterprises , combined with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the newly created land use plan in sub @-@ areas only in the spring of this year .
in the area of sub @-@ time lar@@ n the commercial area is extended by two plots in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
accordingly , the city of the Main has the best opportunities to attract more jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence field Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether financial institutions can continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , it is enough for them to be admitted to the UK . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are currently using large US banks .
several banks have already announced plans to shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lob@@ b@@ ying association calcul@@ ates 10@@ 000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which unites the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area , as well as further important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory agency E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk group ES@@ R@@ B .
although the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) is headquartered in Paris , it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Luxembourg has a large fund industry , it also cuts worse , just like Dublin &apos;s infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
furthermore , the city has easily available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it &apos;s not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , the rent for first @-@ class commercial property was 50 percent higher than in the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crimin@@ ality .
in a ranking of the consulting firm Merc@@ er , the city occupies seventh place , Luxembourg at No. 19 , Dublin on No@@ .@@ 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a matter of preference : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its strong position as a financial centre for the European Single Market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the I@@ W concludes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe .
in London , according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba in late 2015 , some 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. District Jud@@ ge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the legal costs that you have ar@@ isen from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was freed from a compensation install@@ ment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which were linked to the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including the Mein@@ ard and other un@@ ethical actions .
when the complaint lod@@ ged on Thursday , U.S. District Jud@@ ge Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to the cost incurred during the defense of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ ate with Gilead , which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medications that can heal over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck compl@@ ained to each other and claimed ownership of laboratory work with which Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir pro@@ hi@@ bits active ingredient in the drug of Gilead .
troops backed by the US say they have reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State .
troops supported by the US have taken full control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters have left the city , a spokes@@ man of the group on Friday said .
after the exo@@ dus of the remaining group of fighters buried inside the city , the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) are now comb@@ ating the city .
they have freed over 2,000 civilians who were held ho@@ stage by the fighters , Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish shared with the D@@ KS allied Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council Reu@@ ters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we just carry out clean @-@ up work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons deserve 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton announced its 2015 tax return , which resulted in the Democrats &apos; presidential candidate and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton &apos;s USD 1 million donated money for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton posted an income of USD 3 million by Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their book on their office in the State Department .
Clin@@ ton &apos;s candidate for Vice President , Sen@@ ator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his last ten years tax declarations together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign assistant J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a stark contrast , Donald Tru@@ mp hides behind false exc@@ uses and re@@ trac@@ ers in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax declarations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations although they are not oblig@@ ated by law to do so . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have declared a tax audit by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clin@@ ton &apos;s election campaign assistant Ian Sam on Twitter , referring to the publication of the presidential candidate of democr@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Michael Coh@@ en , Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s special advisor told CN@@ N that he wouldn &apos;t allow Tru@@ mp to release something before the controls are not finished .
Tru@@ mp@@ s critics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , its donations for char@@ itable organisations , its business units and various other connections , in particular with Russia .
Clinton has already fallen on the subject and released a video on the Internet on Friday , asking Tru@@ mp to publish his tax return on Friday .
on Thursday she addressed the subject also during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ ig@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in the last decades and publish his tax declarations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO has reported that Tru@@ mp paid no or only very little taxes for two years during the 1990s , and a business journalist in the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants on Friday , stating that this could still be the case .
federal taxes have become a subject in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett that would ensure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million will pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an electoral campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in O@@ ma@@ ha last week , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has his seat here , Tru@@ mp to exchange their tax declarations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said that he was also subjected to a tax check of the I@@ RS and Tru@@ mp was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; afraid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has re@@ port@@ edly released tax return by the year 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons , now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an average annual tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 4@@ 0.5 % .
the 2015 tax return showed that it was only $ 100 of their income as wages , unlike most of the Americans .
their main money investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings were tax@@ ed from USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 .

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ works promote Tanz@@ ani@@ as Ele@@ phant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going to inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der .
the method proved to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which already had the idea years ago , intensified its support along with the US nature protection by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and crops without hur@@ ting animals .
previously , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves .
Friday is the world &apos;s teleph@@ ony day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the tool@@ kit , we have been able to observe a change in attitudes within these communities , with much more confident that they can stop the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant , &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message .
the first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chil@@ i cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ works body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition switch .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom will burst with a b@@ ang and spray fine dust to ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der into the air .
a touch is usually sufficient to ch@@ ase the elephant .
one last option is a ver@@ ge that shoots a gold @-@ drawn fire@@ works in the air , causing a loud , bright explosion .

however , the city council now unanim@@ ously rejected the application for the new building of a sales office near the Rhine river bank in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine River which is under construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle , we welcome new tra@@ des@@ men , but at this location in an exposed location on the Rhine shore this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director dis@@ moun@@ ts Berlin &apos;s Hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots reli@@ eved a media uph@@ eav@@ al after revealing that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list any Israeli pre @-@ election since there were Arab guests according to a staff . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country &apos;s selection list .
however , the country was not listed among the countries that could be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead , Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to choose Israel through its own call center .
looking for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
the answer he received there &quot; shocked him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel employee said that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel management . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind the scenes triggered more fur@@ y in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have asked that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great dis@@ grace &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and upset by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a rather large resonance on the Internet where people called the whole a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of them submitted to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; given &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the alleged sum@@ mons of Arab guests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in another post , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located at the pos@@ h Kur@@ für@@ sten@@ damm , is close to a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel quickly proved all alleg@@ ations of themselves and called the incident an &quot; mistake &quot; and &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; with Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; direct statement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to not record Israel into the short@@ wave selection list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code is now added .
police op@@ ts tear gas &amp; rubber fin against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students joined the police together with the police in Sao Paulo on Thursday when they were gathered to demonstrate the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police put tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which led to the police using rubber shells and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about the plans .
according to the Gover@@ nor of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are being implemented to save money .
some of the protest@@ ants were seen gra@@ ff@@ iti against the provisional president Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
the recent protests took place a few days after demonstr@@ ators went on the streets to support the susp@@ icious President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff who had been dismissed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly increases to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trading rate between Moscow and Te@@ hr@@ an grew by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted up , the interest in Russian companies grew strongly in businesses in the country , the ambassador shared .
Russian enterprises take up existing connections with Iran while new companies are willing to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further commercial expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it noted that the trading rate between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and was $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports in Iran increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade recovery was achieved by deliveries of machinery , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan is heading for a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
last year , the Russian representation represented around 35@@ ,000 vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries concerned with the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year are broken , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only a few Russians visit Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; I personally recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who received the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good state , &quot; he said .
looking for witnesses : beverage market in forest fires falling over
a rob@@ ber@@ y of prey has been practiced on Thursday evening at the drink market of Re@@ we XXL at Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the pres@@ tige of a fire@@ arm , three dark dressed people , who had m@@ um@@ bled their faces , demanded the withdrawal of cash from the employee of the beverage market and then fled at first on foot and then presumably with a silver VW Golf .
how much money was captured , the police did not share .
the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters large , so relatively small .
the beverage market is accessible and poorly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
after the attack , the perpetr@@ ators must be banned in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and escaped from the gravel parking space situated opposite the parking house entrance with the silver @-@ coloured car , possibly towards B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
who made observations at the time of the tat@@ too ( at 19.@@ 45 o &apos;clock ) , who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y , should urgently report to the police .
Nag@@ old : play and fun in summer@@ time
eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social educational day group / social group work of the child protection association Nag@@ old with their supervis@@ ors during their summer break in Nuss@@ dorf near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
in the quiet surroundings Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle the food @-@ joyful group was lod@@ ged during the first week of school .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand we went to B@@ essen with the visit of the string zoo .
to the other to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery .
the third excursion led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about the daily life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
during the hot days , the group enjoyed the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , who invited for jumping , swimming and plan@@ ing .
children and car@@ ers have been treated with their self @-@ prepared body@@ courses such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ger Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese .
in workshops it was made to create beautiful pieces of jewelry made of beads and stones or made of wood a Roman @-@ mill game .

on the day of the voyage home the sun laugh@@ ed and the children and young people returned home .
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgri@@ m to the Do@@ or of Mer@@ cy
the mini@@ stran@@ ts from the pastoral care unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
together , four stages were ma@@ stered .
in order to bridge the time until the next romantic pilgrimage of all the mini@@ stran@@ ts in two years , the Ober@@ minist@@ ran@@ tes round St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
various pilgrimage destinations have been tested and finally decided in favour of the Epis@@ cop@@ al city of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgri@@ m &apos;s destination was offered on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy .
16 Min@@ is from B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gre@@ ene , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and Hei@@ ligen@@ zimmern were on the way .
in the evening before , Pastor Stor@@ ost sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the Pil@@ gri@@ m Cross and informed the pilgri@@ m blessing .
from Hor@@ b we drove by train to the starting point of Vil@@ lingen , where also a minster Un@@ ser@@ er loved woman stood and so the pilgri@@ m path from Münster was started .
the individual day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening with a short impulse with various prayers , songs and texts .
but also on the way , the Min@@ is also repeatedly played R@@ ast to sing together a song from a specially assembled pilgri@@ m song .
the par@@ ishes of the local par@@ ishes were at their disposal for the nights .
at the stage destinations Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller cared for a tasty and for@@ ti@@ fying dinner and the breakfast .
we continued on the second day via Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
after that , the stage was followed by the stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , but had to break down about 500 metres in high heat and then climbed again afterwards .
in the evening , the deserved reward was a common barbecue at the lake &apos;s edge .
after the morning pulse on the fourth pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter we went to the final stage to Freiburg .
clearly facilit@@ ated and happy the Min@@ is arrived at the Freiburg Min@@ ster in the late afternoon and passed through the portal of mercy .
with a small impulse , God was thank@@ ed here .
at the evening mass in Münster the min@@ is of Ko@@ operator Markus O@@ bert were welcomed at the pilgrimage destination .
after the divine service , pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the B@@ reis@@ gau metropolis .
in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b by train .
at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were characterised .
Scot@@ s@@ man Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ ks home when Br@@ ite Gold is ring@@ ing for cycling
Scotland &apos;s call for Sk@@ inner last night in the men &apos;s team spr@@ int in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor that his fellow coun@@ try@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y made himself to E@@ igen . the young@@ ster made the legend proud when he rus@@ hed home to get a victory from the favourites of New Zealand .
four years ago England claimed a shock@@ ing victory while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after they took a modest sixth place in March at the London Under@@ ground World Championships in spite of the res@@ ignation of Ho@@ ys .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in good time as a hin@@ dran@@ ce .
Ho@@ y &apos;s retirement has created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ du , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y prevailed - and Sk@@ inner scored an Olympic board in the qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round .
and the British trio won the Du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ du was just back after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation , driving in a higher gear in order to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as BBC expert and dropped Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they climbed onto the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am just here to do my best and to make myself a name .
we placed an olymp@@ ic record in the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph of 2012 at the side Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ di said that after a weak start he intentionally fell on the train .
he later with@@ drew this statement and there was no objection of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such an outstanding victory there was no such problem this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like the whole UK flags at the tri@@ b@@ une like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have joined together as a team in the last three months .
we did so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win at the Olympics again .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London .
if that is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form Kenn@@ y it is possible in the realm of the possibility that he repeated Ho@@ y &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a apparently holy date for British sports ; on that day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
this would be the same by Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y will take part in the Sprint , which will start today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilometre race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 at the finish .
the world record , which won Gold in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
yesterday he had argued with officials before the qualification as function@@ aries called him to measure his height .
in the corresponding women competition , which will continue and be completed tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in a world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team relies on its strong track team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and win a band of med@@ als .
after a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio have been shut down .
they played drama in the background , so the res@@ ignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the middle of sex and bul@@ b@@ bing designs as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if one sees the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ o@@ drome , it looks as if the now legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , will be repeated again .
future of the melt production of Port@@ land due to the lifting of the energy supply question@@ able
the future of the aluminium mel@@ ts of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers - are at stake , as the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and that all supply contracts are eliminated , as the supplying energy company announced .
this step was followed by the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to the operation of the plant .
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years will exp@@ ire in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the Al@@ coa complex in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2000 jobs -@@ direct as well as indirect - could be at risk with a closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effect as the melt consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity production of Vict@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 Al@@ coa closed the Point Henry melt , which led to a closure of Angl@@ es@@ ea &apos;s power station last year .
the sm@@ el@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses its money and risks a closure .
this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium melting pot with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , announced that three further owners will announce their contracts .
the facility is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p share smaller shares .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity by melting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which should have entered into force in November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month notice period , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from this point , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on the earnings on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L announced that it had already written the value of the contracts in its annual sales amounting to $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ation of a cancellation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ coa said that the decision to contract the Tre@@ aties , the &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the sm@@ el@@ ting and to ensure the power supply to the melt &quot; is not impaired .
the US company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , who should have entered into force from November this year , even if it is still an explanation why it res@@ ig@@ ned from the contract .
analysts warn of the poor economic conditions of the industry prior to the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near New@@ castle .
in reference to the analy@@ st &apos;s statements at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts per year and around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity per year .
should both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generating set it wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality TV star , Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of the Vog@@ ue
Kendall J@@ en@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an J@@ en@@ ner C@@ lans Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vog@@ ue .
Antonio , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der , ran to fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ ag@@ ram account .
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to tears , &quot; Antonio wrote .
the cover of Cover@@ s followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , a kri@@ p@@ ected reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an J@@ en@@ ner family ( with the exception of Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n problems ) as well as in the presence of the most popular show bi@@ z unc@@ le and producer of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest .
this represents the stere@@ otyp@@ ed plot almost every birthday sep@@ t@@ ress of a children &apos;s programme ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence : &quot; you thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to let her other girls take part in this public@@ ity somehow .
with regard to the September issue of the Vog@@ ue , a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans began with certainty .
Kend@@ al &apos;s big sister Kim likes her , as far as the Vog@@ ue cover is concerned ( her and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September issue is the most popular issue of the year for Vog@@ ue .
with a gir@@ th similar to a fashion magazine , the output draws a large number of adverti@@ sers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the rolling 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the revelation of his cover star is so eag@@ erly anticipated that in the last two years pictures of the magazine were still le@@ aked before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models , celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar prize winner and slide @-@ brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga received the honour .
but even with the small chance that Ms J@@ en@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the former category , she is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or young@@ sters of today who know how to turn a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even if everything applies to J@@ en@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers does not like success to everyone .
with their reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the world of fashion has always been a bit ten@@ se .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ en@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed and called them &quot; the mist@@ y of the moment . &quot;
these feelings are boiled up again when the message came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vog@@ ue cover .
but running around on the m@@ ess seems to pass by at the point .
Kendall J@@ en@@ ner is the cover of the September issue of the Vog@@ ue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
it runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
they and all their sisters sell images of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her made pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she can see in reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
community centers annually assign 16@@ 0,000 people annually
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s relief figures are rejected annually by the municipal authority centres , while the industry is preparing for the effects of further short@@ cuts to already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means of unfair del@@ o@@ gi@@ ations and the like - are rejected in their appeal to free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which have already been fully utili@@ sed , are prepared for further cuts .
as of June next year , it is fores@@ een that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds .
the director of the community center of Que@@ bec , James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Le@@ aders showed that thousands of people are dismissed each year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only be worse without removing the resolution of the Federal Government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s Community Centre Centr@@ es are chron@@ ically under@@ funded , meaning that thousands of people of important services you need will be rejected , &quot; he said .
people who leave violent relations , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and op@@ pres@@ sive debts , families separated by divisions , workers who have been un@@ just@@ ly dismissed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need .
as of June 2017 , the federal government will cut the funds by 30 percent , which means thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call on the Federal At@@ tor@@ ney General and Federal Chancellor and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these short@@ cuts so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the State Government fulfilled its promise to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of community centers and their customers , and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work .
Donald Tru@@ mp election campaign accused of recru@@ iting fellow workers
new York : Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s campaign was accused of in@@ action after having been told that her campaign manager for North Carolina was a fire@@ arm on a staff while on the way in February in a je@@ ep .
the incident is described in an indictment which was filed on Wednesday at Charlotte Regional Court by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i admitted to have been waiting for months for the matter to be settled internally before realizing that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulled a gun , put his right finger on the trigger , and r@@ ammed the race in Vinc@@ ent Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i in his indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after compl@@ ying with the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ordin@@ i stated that at least four more people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he lod@@ ged in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons don &apos;t have to be fired to harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accus@@ ation comes only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate released a rebellion when he said a crowd in North Carolina , that the Second A@@ mend@@ ment should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton was elected and judges should appoint judges .
Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign clearly stated that the media had viol@@ ated his words from the context and that he would not rise to violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ordin@@ is complaint demands damages from the campaign to breach the duty of care and of Philip for bodily injury and lasting emotional damage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s Press Office &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hope Hi@@ cks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was not to be reached for a comment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
attempts to contact Philip smote also out of absence .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer co @-@ workers of the campaign .
on calls from his consulting company , Innovative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted .
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp has previously led a controversial campaign .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before Länder elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the states of Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , significant losses for the SPD and CD@@ U government parties are notable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this gave representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black government coalition in the North could scar@@ c@@ ely be ruled , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin .
in both federal states , however , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue the head of the government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD fell from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent five years ago .
according to the survey , the party is just just ahead of the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is controversial between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the Land@@ tag .
despite light losses , the Gre@@ ens hes@@ itated again in Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag despite light losses ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented by 3 percent in the Land@@ tag .
according to the survey , the SPD in the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties only accounted for 23 per cent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
it therefore still lag@@ ged behind the green with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but in front of the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented at the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties at 14 percent for the first time .
at 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pir@@ ates would not miss the move in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : the Nokia Communic@@ ator was launched 20 years ago .
the followers dominate the world today - his maker experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half kilograms and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thi@@ cker and bigger , so it was not good at hand .
on the contrary , it was pretty cl@@ ums@@ y .
the built @-@ in memory initially amounted to eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would range today for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigab@@ ytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9@@ ,000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; happened exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in stores - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros , fans can still buy the equipment on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age .
20 years ago , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as &quot; office in western pocket format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for those standards : SMS and e @-@ mails were sent and received , also by fax the communic@@ ator was to be reached .
even the access to web pages was possible by HTML browsers , albeit tor@@ mented slowly .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded similar to a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
the price was rather proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , thus about 1400 Euros .
the average retail price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
nobody could suspect in August 1996 that communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story though not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s mobile division experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold to Microsoft and handled .
today , vendors dominate the market , all of which came much later than Nokia .
being online anytime and anywhere is everyday for a lot of people .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
about 1.4 billion devices were sold , Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units .
worldwide sales with the equipment is roughly 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ going business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
in the meantime , a whole industry has emerged around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough on the mass market was only beginning at the beginning of 2007 , while Apple &apos;s boss Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communic@@ ator , all easily to use via touch screen .
Apple &apos;s trium@@ phant success began , but today the iPhone is the Group &apos;s most important product .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry who ruled the market had the following .
she finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the Sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
on average every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must all learn to take the Smartphone away once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in the Siemens Board for Human Resources . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me this was the biggest attraction of He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws , just like in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics took great benefits for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and this will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our local communities alone , we will already have 10,000 new apprentic@@ es@@ hips , create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of the expansion of He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws is too great .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ aming on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ a@@ throw .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ a@@ throw answers any question asked .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ a@@ throw is for many and not for single an infrastructure project .
enlargement is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in business growth and bequ@@ e@@ ath@@ ed a legacy of skills and employment both at the airport and throughout the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - the five year in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , until T@@ 2 , which was built in the midst of the two most frequ@@ ented walk@@ ways in the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion on private investments .
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for UK and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ a@@ throw will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

&quot; &quot; &quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , the software manufacturer tries to b@@ ypass ad blocking , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scratch and mouse game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display lock@@ ings on its desktop site , Ad@@ block Plus published a blo@@ g@@ post in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertisement in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared that his desktop page would change the coding for his adver@@ ts to make it more difficult to detect what part of the page advertising is .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this sort of h@@ in @-@ and @-@ forth battle is underway between the line @-@ up open source community and the envel@@ op@@ ers since the invention of display lock@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicator lamps have become the industry .
according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe some 200 million people worldwide use display lock@@ ers worldwide ; almost four times as much 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion active users who access Facebook about their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of the advertising revenue .
the company , apart from the fact that mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared a speaker .
advertising on Desktop PCs makes a large proportion of revenues , so that Facebook appears to be worthwhile investment of such a step .
on Tuesday Facebook shared that it would be possible to update his &quot; ad preferences tool &quot; in order to have more control over them .
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block would cause new filters to be of concern because they would also block contents on the page that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared a Facebook message in an email message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a silent means , which is why we have concentrated on developer tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences in order to put more control into the hands of the people .
assume a woman with presum@@ ed suicide on Swiss free@@ way
the victim was lying in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call witnesses after a woman was transferred to a highway in the early hours of the morning at a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
a woman lay in the dark &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that at the age of 49 , a Swiss guy who was handed over by several vehicles , including a lor@@ ry , wanted to kill himself .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police said , asking these and every witness of the incident to report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an investig@@ ative procedure was opened , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter shared the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a clas@@ h avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers will not be held ac@@ coun@@ table .
in each of the two cases - where a person was running in the dark on the highway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian is running on the highway in the middle of the night as it was called in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ eman was acqu@@ itted of the negli@@ gent killing , after having passed a man and killed who lay in August 2014 one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and has become unconscious on the street , absorbed the court .
the court found that the police -- who responded to an emergency call -- went on a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ een situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges , should report to the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Cli@@ m@@ amo@@ del : Venus once inhabited
according to the projections of a new NASA air amo@@ del , Venus was probably inhab@@ itable .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies by NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus on the basis of tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate researchers .
the model was designed to determine if the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere could once have had ground @-@ like conditions .
scientists first pointed out that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and still slowly turned on .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably showed more dry areas than the earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protect against fast evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus is exposed to its daily horiz@@ ons of the sun for almost two months , &quot; said G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts as a umbrella , to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures which are some degrees cooler than those of the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus , which resembles the evolution previously assumed by planetary scientists .
although it was probably inhab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of billions years .
their oceans evapor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was blown away by ultra@@ violet light .
when their hydro@@ gen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide came back with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , as we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy coming back as a coach of the A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to low co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
as an alternative president / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new coach .
&quot; in the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of ho@@ ckey operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a position .
during the summer , I thought for a long time and a lot about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , needed it and bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations must be perfectly coordinated with the organisation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must also have a right to co @-@ determination in decisions affecting the performance of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate what he did for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Roy has won the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards as the best trainer in the league during his debut season 2013 @-@ 14 .
he led the club to 112 points and ranked first in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the late season in each of the last two years .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 stamp in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card Spot in the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart Roy has won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ öl@@ labour@@ ers resume talks , put on strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour disputes relating to the compensation for North Sea oil workers are suspended , while all the parties sit for a new round of discussions at the table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group have been carried out spor@@ adic@@ ally on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the un@@ winding process of the present dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will stop several day @-@ to @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks , which will start at the beginning of next year to address the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , which was the first in over 25 years , was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
wood Group has shortened the rates to its counter@@ parts in the North Sea by around 9 percent this year due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s credit rating follows a 10 percent drop for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts will give the company the space needed to get through the market down@@ turn .
Shell has released thousands of people for its part and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas activities in up to 10 countries as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the British Energy Company BG Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that had stepped up by the British decision in June to leave the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish parliamentary committee , Dave Anderson , met with workers &quot; leaders this week to discuss one of the largest employment disputes that took place in the North Sea since a generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler World Teles@@ cope helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates under the stars of the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars are rotating in star@@ gates at different rates , and in what context the rotation periods are related to the resurrection of the planet .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star@@ gates , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light @-@ years away from the Earth .
many stars in this cluster of stars , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood .
they are now turning the fastest .
at peak rotation rates , these mature stars stum@@ ble large amounts of star @-@ winds .
since these winds are travelling through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star fails , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- such as sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars .
hull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars rotating slow pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
since the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is still much to learn about how , how , when and why stars can slow down their rot@@ ational rates and hang up their &quot; dance shoes &quot; so to speak .
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball Star ki@@ cks off
the tears ran faster at Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days from Base to Base .
after his emotional re @-@ arrival , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will wear the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on 12 August against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say good@@ bye to Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; said the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star @-@ Game @-@ participant of the major league bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected to the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature in a ten @-@ year contract has given him 27 million US dollars a year since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will be working as a consultant and youth coach at full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid it back for a long time .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed to make some mil@@ estones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two more bas@@ eball players show similar values in the most important statistics .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be admitted to the fame hall of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was on the field , so controversial is its appearance outside the square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 the super@@ star awarded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to have been banned from 2001 to 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was closed for 211 games due to an involvement in the so @-@ called bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered the main suspect to have been receiving performance @-@ promoting funds for years through an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a law@@ suit , the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done a favor for the year 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez at that time sweet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also his farewell @-@ days are not no@@ is@@ eless .
while many bas@@ eball legends occupy the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez frequently had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di .
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and following the conditions with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , received sympathy for the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e arch@@ rival Boston red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; sang the supporters of the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team .
Olympics 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases
caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland may not start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing incidents .
a caught ath@@ lete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing events have become known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese swi@@ mmer@@ ing Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 metre obstacle runner in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and ruled out in Brazil - immediately before the start of the already critical athle@@ tics competitions these messages come to an end .
last Sunday Ch@@ en has been demonstrating the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
on Friday afternoon , the International Sport Court CA@@ S confirmed its expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had the fourth place in the fin@@ als over 100 m of butterfly , only around 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday Ch@@ en should have participated in the pre@@ runs of more than 50 m of freedom style .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B @-@ trial and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and demands full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport Court CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S is responsible for sanc@@ tioning athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio the news le@@ aked over the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ak@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on himself to the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she was innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The only explanation could be nutritional supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Ath@@ le@@ tics Ath@@ le@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it should act on the banned substance of the EP@@ O blood dop@@ ing agent .
Dan@@ ak@@ owa was pro@@ vision@@ ally suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B sample should have had a positive effect .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately announced his criticism of the ath@@ lete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why athletes do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
for example , all wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation must not take part in Rio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , the case &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was also known , the London Olympic Champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested three days earlier on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both deny the intake , however , both may not start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the athletes start , Dan@@ ak@@ owa &apos;s case is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
the IA@@ AF World Federation had prohibited the complete Russian crew except for systematic dop@@ ing , even the Ken@@ yan women &apos;s nation produced numerous bad news in Rio .
in addition , in the swimming @-@ sport , the previous clubs in China also provided fierce disputes between the athletes .
thus the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic Champion Sun Y@@ ang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium above 200 m of fre@@ estyle , I want to hand over myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun also stood at the centre of an examination with the Australian M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing fraud , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2014 Sun was positively tested with the Chinese Championships on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but only had to sit down for a three month lock .
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de black@@ mail h@@ ack@@ ers their ran@@ som
black@@ mail programmers are currently target@@ ing companies - and are successful in doing so .
according to a recent survey conducted by the Anti @-@ Defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the sur@@ vey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months were at least once , sometimes multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion .
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som required by the perpetr@@ ators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
the offen@@ ders speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes on attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potentially uns@@ atis@@ factory ran@@ som is significantly higher than for private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes CEO Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 , most Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising .
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
only private users were the target , but the change to company attacks took place in the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works for a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim , it searches for recently modified files like Word , Excel or database files as well as after archives of pictures and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and cle@@ ars the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the demands of the black@@ mail .
in order to get the end @-@ key code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of the cryp@@ to@@ currencies Bit@@ coin .
but where the personal photo database is at stake in private users , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production still stands .
correspon@@ dingly higher the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware hits .
22 per cent of the German companies affected reported losses due to Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to completely inter@@ rupt their business operations , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany there were already several hospitals victims of attacks whose patients can be threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : don &apos;t pay , you only support the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay will get their data back .
for managers it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetr@@ ators in the face of down@@ time in operation .
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know that and try to build a good reputation .
in an up @-@ to @-@ date study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure have investigated the user @-@ winning areas and contact with the black@@ mail and come to the result : the perpetr@@ ators actually try to build a kind of customer service in order to take more money .
they explain their victims by chat on how they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set free accessible support sites or dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t free sample files .
and if individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euro , companies must partly negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to get their data un@@ encrypted .
given the potentially high and relatively risk @-@ free gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware recovery , the h@@ ack@@ ers are becoming more professional and sharing the job , says safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the anti @-@ virus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware circa within a week . &quot;
but it is more likely that these are three or four people .
the programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software construction kit to the actual black@@ mail .
the previously malware kits have been created by purchasing malware , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; included in delivery is an adaptation tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the black@@ jack then searches for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly bought software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
so one logs in one of the forums underground , bu@@ ys the set from a criminal and asks another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is made by certified calcul@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually the criminals then commission sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known among many companies that better secure their data .
more than 50 percent of the companies IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey rely on rep@@ airing Ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful sei@@ z@@ ure , the perpetr@@ ators thre@@ aten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes CEO Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the type of data , the damage potential is much higher than before .
in future , the perpetr@@ ators could hen@@ ce@@ forth take completely new targets on the internet of things to the grain .
at the de@@ con h@@ acker conference , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the internet under their control .
in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could certainly be a ran@@ som .
if the perpetr@@ ators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and even the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row and in the rear , it does not work in any place .
the materials of the interior are well @-@ processed and seem pleasant , only the cockpit top drops down there .
versatile than comparable vehicles , the HR @-@ V is available for storage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l with folded back rests and 10@@ 26 l with folded back rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the back bench can be folded up like a movie armchair and thus offer storage space , which is 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling .
the trunk can be loaded easily , but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
however , he should somewhat qui@@ eter his work .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is gr@@ ati@@ fying .
there is another engine : a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort .
but the steering should be a bit more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment in the tested top version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the security systems belong to the City emergency brake assist ( working up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because he ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during manoeu@@ v@@ ring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very reliable is the high @-@ beam assistant .
and the intelligent control regulator re@@ acts to the traffic sign recognition and th@@ rot@@ tles the speed if necessary .
the full connectivity is available only for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more .
two USB and one HDMI jack are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some .
the roughly 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are all right .
those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive gasoline from 200@@ 00 euros , the diesel starting at 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with Euro 6 emissions standards .

airline is not liable : crash on passenger bridge
a airline is not liable for the crash of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is only possible in case of risks that are typical of aviation .
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a kne@@ ec@@ ar in the fall .
but the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court .
the airline had to pay no damages to the man .
event of illness : when does the organizer pay
after their journey , sick people only get back money if the cause of the disease is doubt@@ less in the hotel .
but this is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests have proven to show the same symptoms .
in the negotiated case , a family was severely ill with diarr@@ ho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their tur@@ f .
she spent almost the whole holiday in the room .
their illness led the holi@@ day@@ makers to a broken wastewater treatment plant that allegedly poll@@ uted the sea water .
the family felt that the trip had been flaw@@ ed and compl@@ ained against the organizer .
the plain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success in court .
indeed , the sewage treatment plant was in fact defective .
but the promot@@ er experienced only shortly before departure of the plain@@ ti@@ ffs .
until then he had to assume that sea water was fine .
he did not viol@@ ate his duties of information , thus the judgment .
especially since there were no im@@ puri@@ ties found in the water samples .
the illness of several hotel guests - possibly through con@@ ta@@ gion among themselves - belongs to the general risk of life .
there were 6@@ 91 guests only 38 .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said , after the violent acts of violence in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have concerns about further attacks .
the state needed to be calm and determined at the same time to react to acts of terrorism .
sure : our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and spl@@ itting .
we will not afford this triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if offen@@ ders would have to leave the country sooner , this will increase security and strengthen the agreement of the people for refugee policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve a implementation of the proposals by the 2017 Bundestag election .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in medium @-@ fourth magnitude over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism must be under penalty again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; video surveillance should be improved , the ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire will be improved so that the purchase of weapons in the internet is more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last much discussed weld duty for physicians should be maintained in accordance with de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words .
however , in dialogue with the medical profession he wants to look for solutions how to reduce the threat of citizens , he said with a glance at mental ab@@ norm@@ alities .
in order to counter@@ act the radic@@ alization of refugees , the minister considers a better social support necessary .
teachers must be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ zed people .
in pursuit of criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) de Ma@@ izi@@ ère plans the use of concealed investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Interior Minister expressed clearly against Action@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a cow@@ ard@@ ly for the discern@@ ers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel said the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rep@@ elled calls from the Union after a bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of double citizenship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he considers a general ban on full @-@ wear to be constitu@@ tionally problematic .
you can &apos;t for@@ bid everything you refuse and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
one can talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses to court .
green boss Simone Peter accused the minister that he wanted to simulate action and capacity with ever new anti @-@ terrorism p@@ act .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet pro@@ verb@@ s and a sharpen@@ ing of the right of residence permit the people in this country no more safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway exit
it st@@ alls regularly on the circum@@ fer@@ ential road - here a picture of November .
but this should change : the law of law shall be extended .
this is a good news for all car enthusiasts who are standing in traffic at the traffic road every evening in traffic jam when they ride over the motorway junction ( A 43 ) .
on the coming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) , road construction extends in the area between Hammer Street and Wes@@ er Straße in the right @-@ hand bending track by 700 meters .
drivers can then thread directly from the hammer road to the right .
the big advantage : the traffic is spl@@ itting early , whereby the overall passage of the traffic is improved on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U group in the district &apos;s representative Münster @-@ West .
the track nar@@ rows on the feeder to the driver , especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the back@@ log goes up to the bridge over the Alber@@ go trail and sometimes even beyond .
the reason is the eye @-@ eye on the B 51 shortly before the departure Wes@@ er Straße .
from here , the traffic is guided only one lane via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built in a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load @-@ bearing capacity , in order to record the heavy @-@ load traffic two @-@ lane .
how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated workshop @-@ daily traffic jam will last , the competent national firm cannot say .
however , it is to be expected with years : the bridge has an official remaining service life up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal clearance , the state enterprise has deliberately chosen the road @-@ weaker time during the school holidays because it is to be expected with disabilities .
the traffic will be led by the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural Travel : cultural offers for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Junge Theater are now planning a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with mig@@ r@@ atory and refugee camps to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has attended a presentation of the award @-@ winning play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Das Un@@ seen Haus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Young Theater Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; 19 students visited the small house between 11 and 15 years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote cultural integration of young people with mig@@ r@@ atory and refugee camps , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project .
most young@@ sters of the class came from September 2015 to March 2016 , among others , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster and speak little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic pictures and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , thus the press release of the Young Theater Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from lingu@@ istics , and the Junge Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a musical theatre project .
from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration background will have the opportunity to visit professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theat@@ rical language teaching are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
in view of the increased numbers of refugees , the association counts with many classes that want to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for better weather improvement
the weather turned the star @-@ schn@@ u@@ ppen @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany on the night to Friday a line through the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was bad for clouds and rain to watch the spectacle of heaven , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we see many shooting stars in the sky .
the shooting stars are Per@@ sei@@ den , which with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour belong to the fastest shooting stars .
they have their name because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
in the evening you roll around forever , at night you are awake for hours , and in the morning it is far from the wake @-@ up ring no longer to think of sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of the adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing .
how to express sleeping problems or sleep disorders ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many reasons underlying them , stresses Hans @-@ Günter V@@ oting , member of the board member of the German Association for Batt@@ ali@@ on and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
what one understands inland , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , i.e. a single and dor@@ man@@ t disorder .
just sleeping many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ kne@@ cht , board member of the German Dental Association with practice in Var@@ el in Lower Saxony .
what is behind sleep problems ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind this , organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medicines are stuck .
in@@ frequently the sleep distur@@ b@@ ance is an expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is especially common in depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ ak . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that various factors condition each other .
for example , those who have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc can be bad , wake up every two to three hours and possibly begin to sal@@ ute about everyday problems and worries , there is an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I go to the doctor with sleep problems ?
anyone who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is com@@ promised in the day should go to the doctor .
the depression can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical discomfort such as stomach or head@@ ache .
to allevi@@ ate sleeping disorder , it is important to find out their causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medicines - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ question .
there is scar@@ c@@ ely ser@@ ene sleeping medicine in Germany , emphas@@ ises Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary dor@@ m medical center of the Char@@ ité Universitäts@@ medizin Berlin .
therefore , in case of sleeping problems , one should first turn to the GP , advises the we@@ ft .
this can be clari@@ fied with investigations , whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep , and what happens ?
for example , for the examination in the sleep laboratory , doctors advise , for example , in snor@@ ing with respir@@ ators , in case of ill @-@ fatigue , sleep@@ wal@@ kers or if one does not find the cause of a sleeping disorder , Fi@@ ba@@ o explains .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only please do not make lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ ba@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after covering , one goes to bed at its normal time .
in addition to the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger .
in addition , a camera draws on the sleeping end on the ceiling .
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a few adjusting screws which can be used for better sleep .
walking counts on : regular sleep and stopping times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , not watch TV for falling asleep , avoid alcohol and do not look at the clock at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is quite and at all not condu@@ ci@@ ve to .
what the jungle camp with missing med@@ als in swimming has to offer
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ bler commented on Facebook to dis@@ appoint the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he held gold for the first time at the World Championships in Doh@@ a and at the same time set up his first world record .
now , the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler presented himself in front of his former team @-@ mates via Facebook .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 € premium and a jungle kö@@ nig 15@@ 0.000 € no one should wonder about missing med@@ als , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the transport system in the swimming @-@ sport is bad , however , the dop@@ ing controls are very good .
in this way , we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not even see or even operate it on dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not say that the controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ ty would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever cannot control a certain time before World Cup / OS of independent audi@@ tors of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demands the ham@@ burger , who meanwhile operates an ice cream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de of Lu@@ gg@@ age arrest
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
on Thursday , the police officers of the Düsseldorf Police arrested two women and two men aged 50 to 61 .
the susp@@ ects had committed several hand@@ ker@@ chiefs and baggage @-@ ste@@ els as a ban@@ ker .
at 21.@@ 30 , civilian officials in the area of the Düsseldorf Airport recognized a gang known to polic@@ emen from past theft charges .
the two women and two men have committed several off@@ ences since mid @-@ July and have been collectively , socially and professionally .
the experts of the Police In@@ spec@@ tor 34 can demonstrate four actions that have been submitted specifically to the protection of criminal off@@ ences in Germany .
they had captured a total of over 15,000 Euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; old buildings , a few lin@@ den trees , in between a rest of cob@@ ble@@ stones : the Riga Street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not look like this , but the police are among the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot;
passing the road from east to west , one passes play@@ grounds , a freshly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; someone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spra@@ yed on the façade of a gray house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
compared to a Li@@ dl , which will soon be torn down , a house with high windows and 133 new ten@@ ants will be built here until 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; articles about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the competent real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , will be bil@@ led with burning cars in recent weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have lease agreements , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin interior sen@@ ator , Henkel had spoken out several times for a hard action by the police against the project , the area designated as a &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
on June 22nd , the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , had been cleared with 300 police officers , pat@@ rolled the police three weeks according to official statements , with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , blocked sections of the road and stopped visitors to enter the house with number 94 .
meanwhile , building workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown owners of the house .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal , and a day later police and construction workers moved under the jubil@@ ation of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon , the road works peac@@ efully : parents go for a walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk about late Sp@@ ät@@ i .
in the immediate vicinity of the house @-@ projects there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
left violence is not the main or@@ ge of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , which raises three children here , is mainly irrit@@ ated by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the concern for increasing r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , who predominantly wanted police protection against v@@ and@@ ali@@ atory left .
the dit@@ ch that the Berlin internal sen@@ ator and the police between the occup@@ ying occup@@ ants and their neighbors do not exist .
Friedrichsha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class quarter , which today has a low average income and high risk of poverty in comparison to the rest of the city .
in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer Street close to the Riga .
while the Main@@ zer was evacu@@ ated under a large police force in a real road battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Riga area and are still inhabited by the people who had been occup@@ ying them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the city district has become increasingly magnet for tourists and suff@@ i@@ ants from all over the world over the past few years : now residents of GDR times and former home@@ owners share their neighbourhood .
this is also noticeable in the r@@ ents , which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the R@@ ī@@ ga are attacked as symbols for this development : you can recognize them on inserted disks or freshly painted faç@@ ades that were thrown with colour bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned this year together with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ alone force &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason for not all neighbours to see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crimin@@ ality : crimes like body injury are according to statistics almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
most of the crimes are causing damage that tend to meet new@@ buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a ten@@ ant house for 17 years next to the controversial 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
when it comes to violence , it is important : people in the 94 are their neighbours who did not have been .
even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the Riga region anymore .
for the architect , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here you help each other , live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has deliberately moved to the Riga Street - and stayed .
that is why it was so important for her to get back to her streets : from the police , politics and the media , who suddenly claimed the city of Germany in July .
but in the eyes of inhabitants such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street will continue to be taken away : through ob@@ verse new buildings in former mos@@ quit@@ oes , which disp@@ lace the old residents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are ultimately con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many , but here are rather people who are not so well searched , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am absolutely not able to a@@ vert violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should I do if someone never list@@ ens to it ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the residents .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer hated little understanding for those who were angry about colour bombs : the house @-@ projects and the left @-@ hand scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
those who come from should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub area , can complain about noise there .

Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee advisor
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee advisor for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social educ@@ ator supports the team of the administration of Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees herself as a contact person for all actors : refugees , group of refugees , administration , authorities and anyone else involved .
Reg@@ ine client of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is there , the van@@ ishing Woll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau , which has a problem above all .
in this way , some - less mo@@ cking but rather target@@ ing the multitude of desired areas of responsibility - meant that the administration wanted to write the job .
looking for an administrative specialist with a talent for languages and people , associated with a long experience in the field of social work , just an exhau@@ sting Woll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau .
but administrative work is not its central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le writes .
above all , it is about organisation , work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent job for three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine client that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time players . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are large and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems .
new containers in the Was@@ en@@ straße
a serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection .
you must submit the refugees in their own or rented premises .
the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must bear the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the Board of Agriculture to Commune and Job@@ centers .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time .
de facto , the administration does not find private apartments .
it does not work until now , if one is dependent on private dwell@@ ings , Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common apartments must be in@@ famous as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will soon be installed in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to a firm residence there are intern@@ ships , apprentic@@ es@@ hips , school courts , one @-@ euro jobs and support activities for refugees and migrants who need to be found or set up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more places would be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports Reg@@ ine client . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many work in the building yard or help home@@ work , do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not mean only work .
the day need a fixed structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so I need offers like sports , contacts with locals and above all language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so here , administration and volunteers also jump here .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they have to explain to the refugees that it takes a long time and they can bridge the time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses .
who at some point develop the feeling that he can &apos;t help in Ur@@ bach , do not work and be useless , he will never integrate .
the clear majority was motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are problems too , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says customer honest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people with nothing at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : do the two after the recent occur@@ ren@@ ces fear of radic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine client quite clearly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some may call nai@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a residual risk can and does not want to exclude them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ sed .
these incidents are also subject to refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ ins would complete them completely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine client . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so main and honorary officials have to look out for activities in the region and in the region .
they have always in the background that a new shock of refugees and migrants could soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
to answer this question clearly , politics abh@@ ors .
actually it is unfair to put them hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach , we have not yet arrived where we want to go , &quot; Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le says .
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine client also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bach@@ s are already busy to integrate the existing people sensi@@ bly .
these are currently about 100 people , mainly young men .
