<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer visited with some colleagues a bit of change with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="5">Chio: "golden sport pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes, the horses remembered their holiday, they hunted in quick gallop home to the feed-troughs.</seg>

<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says.</seg>
<seg id="9">And so the riding career ended again.</seg>
<seg id="10">Saturday was Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - again in the vicinity of horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He let his family run over the grounds of the ALRV, on a horse he didn't even bother for photopurposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and therefore also at the CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was absolutely convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports aid presented the Golden Sports Pyramid to the man from Anhausen on a small gala.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of awards to the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes laurel leaf, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and Trumps Economic Policy Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade agreement - they want both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">The two US presidency, however, are unone in tax and energy policy, as well as in a fundamental question.</seg>
<seg id="4">The difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">Of the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump is reluctant to keep the economy small and warns about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to levy the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, claiming Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will massively drive regulation, and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has certain tasks to fulfill, it has deprived opportunities and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, taxes would be increased for the rich, they say.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In that need to be invested, Trump and Clinton say almost word-like.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical wing of the Republican party.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on Trump there could be internal discussion.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump plans to build coal-fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "oil extraction should also be possible in previously protected areas, he wants to terminate the Paris climate agreement." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton, on the other hand, wants to extend and demand renewable energies with its investment programme: "a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpacfic trade agreement, do not want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both of them do not want to isolate the US from international trade, but simply better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should also be paid better, requires about Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump does in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be fixed, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of both camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics are suggesting that the budget deficit would only be greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, at least from the rich, wants to pay more taxes, and whose critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every winged woman has experiences with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">Sexual violence is part of women who escape alone, almost in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house is a refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">There are four women sitting in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each one has a baby, which is at most a year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in her arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looked curiously into the room with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares at the table-top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you talk with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is the division manager of Condrobs, a sponsor for social welfare services in Bavaria, and deals with the topic of women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are refugees.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the North of Munich in one of the few decentralized units for single-winged women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs has set up the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich women's help.</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently it was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men - even not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard against the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has experiences with sexual violence on her escape," "" "says Bahr." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten torture or death, or because their families send them as hopefuls to Europe," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "women outweigh other reasons for the flight:" "" "many steal away secretly, because they don't see any other way out." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">In their homeland, they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honourable morals, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">That drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run, that goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "for example, that tugs demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a rarity," "" "says Bahr." ""</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Whoever believes that the end, as soon as they refute in Germany, is astray, says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here too, single women in refugee camps would often be regarded as inferior and abused in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="32">This means that about 90 percent of women who live in accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized, they appreciate.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "some of the children are certainly not born voluntarily." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so accustomed to saying nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "or they don't dare to speak openly about the experience because the shame is too big." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">Since they often don't know how to help, they need more accommodation only for them, requests Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria, the seven regional governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the question of whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction, some respond with no.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Oberpfalz and Oberfranken, there is no such thing in shelters of governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">Even in Swabians alone, winged women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Oberbayern, Lower and Central Franconia there are in some Community accommodation floors or own houses only for single women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodation for women only.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "also the committee" "" "Rights of Women and Gender Equality" "" "in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommodated separately from men." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "in a study published for the committee, it says:" "" "it is very important that men and women are harassed separately." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "if the privacy is missing or men and women are accommodated together, there can be continuous violence against women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Above all, the washing rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women, is included in the study.</seg>
<seg id="47">How much the women feel this need of protection can be read from the crush that it gives to the house in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="48">"" "" "" "since it has been around for us, we have a long waiting list," "" "says Bahr." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">Representatives of the Assistants have called their union to approve new work campaigns in their disputes relating to a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire Council to approve more safety campaigns from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that there would have been ministers to deal with the concerns of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">Assist physicians and medical students have agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA in July.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of its members voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a letter to the members who were published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairwoman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government was "persevering quietly" problems, which led to the withdrawal of the treaty.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "In view of this, the JDC Board has agreed to fully reject the proposed new treaty and request official renegotiations for all your concerns." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In response to the silence of the government, the JDC Executive Board today convened a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to approve a running programme of escalating labor fighting activities starting at the beginning of September.</seg>

<seg id="11">The head of the BMA assistant doctors Dr. Johann Malawana returned to the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions that had been advised by the BMA.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end to the eight months of war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter-player in the gold-plated Hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I can't resist the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile seemed to be tricky and he barely radiated warmth, even for his restrained relations.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved like that would never be anything bad.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiating, sustainable cows showed that Russia's head of state had nothing to forget.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was kindled.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin came out and accused Ankara to fall back to Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even greater because it was committed by a presumed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Building up the vetoes will be difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months the state controlled media conducted a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The most serious accusations were that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from the President Erdogan, who he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needs first and foremost all the friends he can get after spending last month with a failed coup d "état of almost his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey severely - in particular the ban on charter flights that usually bring millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal onslaught on the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the country television forecast cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows: "tourists there, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious on the West, as it considers the reaction to the attempted power takeover as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">In addition, the continued resentment on the snail stamp of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is anxious to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state won in Ankara a bonus that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow that has a deep fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this dazzling palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to present an "alliance of outsiders" as an analyst once described: two countries that have been violated and badly treated by the West and are now allied.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played a role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents at the press conference said that they had not even stripped the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey deliberately avoided responding to a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasise this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian struggle jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk to each other at least.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian President Moisted Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly released Sergei Ivanov's Chief of Staff.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "IVANOV was part of the narrowest trust group of Putin for many years." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for environmental and transport affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in an opinion of the Kremlin it reads that without giving reasons, Putin has ordered" "" "the dismissal of Ivanovs from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been Vice President since 2012, was appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it means (in Russian) that he later was the Chief of Officer and Chief of Staff of the director.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it's the most important task of the government to support your work as head of state regarding bills of law and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov was asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the smiling faces convincing?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow more mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey Ivanov was a long time one of the closest confidant Vladimir Putin and worked as he was for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the chief of staff resigns at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">Is here the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at present.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim - that a man who was once glorified as a potential president, at once would like to lead Russian environmental policy - came across great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - to entrust a job for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian president's administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the item in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, former member of the KGB National Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was the chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin arrived in power, he called Ivanov as one of five people he trusted in most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was believed that after Putin's second term of office, Ivanov could become President of Russia, as a third term of Putin had violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another close to Putin's allies, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became the president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the northern deck of the Queensferry crossings to the Viaduct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four closures of the" "" "cover blowers" "", "which approach the completion by each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10.000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 oblique cables.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Economic Minister Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Queensor cross country." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project involving over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, almost 79% of the total bridge is at their place and the last section of Decks today gets a concrete kiss for the deck in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project leader of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">With this fantastic project, the closure is groundbreaking high-rise and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the street and its connection with the north tower, we had to close the existing gap on the north or the north side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern entry bridge 700 millimetres south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massif, as the Viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs approx. 6.000 tons and has to be pulled upwards at an incline of about 3%.</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "the SPD proposes a" "" "action plan living" "" "at the next council session." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">But argument is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost, it is about the question: who should build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing until now.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "said S & D Group president Christoph Bratmann:" "" "we agree with the Greens: if you want to build on urban areas, 20 percent of all apartments must be considered social housing in the future." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">However, the favorable apartments may also arise in the continuance.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "but the big dispute in the town hall is, however, said Bratmann:" "" "how to deal with investors who want to build on private areas?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such surfaces, but as much as 20 per cent of the flats as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">A new urban housing development programme, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, should provide incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "the problem, such as Bratmann:" "" "there is currently no agreement between the fractions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even harder editions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">No matter what a frying man, a sharpening of the situation on the housing market appoints.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the action concept is implemented, this will take care of additional tasks in the construction management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is not clear whether we will receive the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the programme is not entirely complete: the 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you reconcile the loss of further 1,300 affordable apartments whose promotion will expire in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent this, the planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm should now be purchased from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be thought of bringing back apartments back into price loyalty.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">The problem could be solved in one fell swoop.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the end of the year, in the western part of the city, deadlines are coming out.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 Apartments can be picked up there in the price connection for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: they do not want the owners, the housing companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social housing in the Western city is drastically increased again, from the goal of so-called confusion.</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of social weak in just a few districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens are counting on the fact that there is still movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "group leader Holger Herlitschke says:" "" "the CDU must go into the boat for a broad majority." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunting for health and happiness that is worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children are no longer going outside but prefer to spend their free time staring on screens has been complaining of many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on videogames and recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities don't exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s (later resulting in a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">As many phenomena of pop culture, the interest before the publication of the game sank in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that the servers overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokemon that will be tracked with a GPS and once they have been found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the delusion and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in the United States, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the" "" "average" "" "person returns every day." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardikilograms, an app for Apple Watch, followed by 35.000 users, the Washington Post recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of people who followed each day jumped 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it merely looks the raw data for performance improvement.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns that people want to take" "" "take 30 minutes" "", "" "" "coming from the sofa" "" "and" "" "being active every day," "" "launched deaf ears because many public messages are boring for health and coming from people that look miserable." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overvalued.</seg>
<seg id="19">Anyone who regularly drives sports reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoor that fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even include new friendships during the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are also grumpy games that have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What's it like?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has made a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if Smartphone-Apps like Fitbit could track our activity earlier, they didn't give us any reason to play sports like this game does.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will fade with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemons's success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world and help many people to hunt more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="5">Dynamic on the jumping horse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortless on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Breathtaking on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="8">On complete line brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now finally the Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast strangled on Thursday to win the title and enlarged the gap between herself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her total result of 62,198 clearly stood in front of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" team mates Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American women Simone Biles Turns on the Swedish beam during the individual multi-campaign team of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American, who wins a multi-fight title and a total of the fifth, while she consolidates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey ended at that moment.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated the last three years her sport, 15 world champion medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion from 1984 Mary Lou Rescue told her that she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">It awaited them a final test in Brazil, a competition that did not go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the individual multi-campaign of women at the summer Olympics 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles took the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as an exclamation mark at the farewell party of the retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although it insisted that during their long journey on the top, never having planned the future, it is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tumbling Pass - is adapted to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is not accidental.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a little child and was discovered by trainer Aimee Boormans mother during a school excursion into the gymnasium in which Boorman trained, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, she has lost no more competition, a winning streak that will last as long as Biles wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even though Samafina was led slightly by two turns, the image deceives.</seg>
<seg id="27">Roast beams and denturns - in which Biles holds the world championship title - lautered.</seg>
<seg id="28">She got back again with 15,433 on the Swedish beam - and with a 15,933 on the floor there was another one.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman hugged her softly when she expected her final bust - a pure form of formality - and tears poured on Biles brilliantly red, white and blue eyeliner, when the vision she once described in her book book became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance of Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a Tiebrake.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "this time, the 22-year-old team of men who is called" "" "Grandma" "" "was a lead." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">After her ground practice she cast kisses to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>

<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on 12 June, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.</seg>

<seg id="6">The police spokesman of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investigators to have a closer look at whether it is connected to four previous attacks.</seg>

<seg id="10">The investigators refused to expose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and died later.</seg>
<seg id="12">Liner, 31, and Ellis's daughter Maleah still died.</seg>
<seg id="13">A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.</seg>
<seg id="14">The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which turned to an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and it is assumed that it was the factory of the serial killer.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine under the Women's Olympics in the gymnastics and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess is and Madison Kocian, which is Catholic, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team is finally reflected in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one among female gymnasts was an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year, Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic winner and the US cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three-fold world championships in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected, yet masterful gymastics routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American, who won gold at an individual multi-campaign event.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are experiencing the top of this sport, but this is not the case in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie took all the same path as Aly and Madison to create it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five" "", "because the next Olympic team will have only four gymnasts in the team. moreover, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics are an expensive sport and gymnasts first and foremost in private sports clubs that are maintained by parents, which arise for training, furnishing, travel, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these trainers are in affluent suburbs that can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the gymnasts maintain their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes since they started the gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to give the municipalities out countless, young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, providing a more affordable and easy-to-reach exercise.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my annual foundation of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events, we have offered free and affordable accommodation in Harlem for more than 15,000 young people (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer young high-quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determinateness for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that will bring thousands of young girls interested in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this genuine representation of "Girl Power" by organizing the Olympic team golds and thank you for being motivated so many young girls with varying backgrounds to start their way, healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers had hoped to finish the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the British Medical Association's officials, but 58 percent of the 37.000 Assistants who voted at a choice rejected him.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July, Hunt announced plans to introduce the treaty forced and said that the NHS would be in a "no man's land" and would be harmful to the employees and patients.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first assistants shall receive a new contract that contains changes to night and weekend dates in order to improve the maintenance of hours of movement.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, chairwoman of the BMA Committee for Assistance, announced last night in a communication with: "assistant doctors have still serious concerns about the proposed treaty, especially that it will heat up the current workforce crisis and it will meet all doctors."</seg>
<seg id="6">With only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress has to be made and time runs out.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "" "" "efforts by the BMA to resolve disputes arising from discussions encountered the government on its own reluctance and sometimes deafening silence." ""</seg>

<seg id="10">Should he not do this, the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further work campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="11">The last strike at the end of April saw a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and specialists were included in order to allow doctors to cover the strike post chain.</seg>
<seg id="12">The ministers had hoped to finish the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformed contract with the British Medical Association's officials.</seg>
<seg id="13">The BMA wants a better weekendcompensation for the 54,000 resident doctors who are subject to the contract.</seg>
<seg id="14">Daniel Mortimer, Director of the NHS staff, urged the assistants to stop the strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mortimer said: "" "" "" "" work combat measures do not achieve anything that only little, but strain already overloaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient, nurses and their families only worry, distress and interruption. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="16">In the last two months we talked to the committee of assistants and responded positively to the concerns about guardianship and whistleplaying with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.</seg>
<seg id="17">Employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those who are returning from vocational training, training courses, reciprocal recognition of the curriculum, training holidays and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health concerning compliance with the agreements with the BMA were in November, February and May.</seg>

<seg id="1">Culture of Political Correctness has allowed electoral fraud in Muslim areas to flourish</seg>
<seg id="2">Former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year due to corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities, ignoring how a devastating government report today revealed.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sir Eric Pickles, former cabinet member, intervenes verbally with the police, election observers, and town halls for ignoring the evidence of electoral abuse on the basis of "hypersensitivity to ethno and religion."</seg>
<seg id="5">The former minister of integration and communal government, which is now an antagonist king, said that intimidation of voters from religious themes would be so bad that the police were allowed to set up lockers outside elective cabins to protect intimidated voters.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "he recommends that voters should take a document to prove their identity in elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "" "" "at present, a voter must simply call his name and address." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">The report suggests not to remove removable ink onto the finger of a person when they leave their vote to prevent someone to choose twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whistleblowers should get more protection, says Sir Eric.</seg>
<seg id="10">It demands that the press should have more access to municipal materials and decisions from unofficial committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "this not only serves against electoral fraud, but is also meant to protect the municipal government from the wider corruption and financial fraud culture associated with it," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets's election scandal in eastern London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a special electoral court ruled that the incumbent mayor of Lutfur Rahman should be dismissed after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his office.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way," and that he silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia accusations.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "Rahman is said to have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 votes were either dubious or the consequence of imitation in which one person chooses another.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">He voiced particularly alarming to the fraudulent briefing - in which older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including guiding of ID to prove the identity</seg>
<seg id="20">In his report it says: "as evidence has been attached that pressure has been exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, to choose according to the will of the elders, in particular communities with Pakistani or banglaeschic background.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "there were concerns that... governmental institutions have knowingly ignored such behaviour as a result of" "" "politically correct" "" "hypersensitivity to ethnic and religion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the prohibition of political activists to process letter selection documents in order to stop "election harvest."</seg>
<seg id="23">The report, which is considered by Theresa May, also demands harder registration checks to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and social security purposes.</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters before choosing according to your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">Do not use removable ink on a person's finger as soon as she has handed her voice to prevent someone to choose twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">Conduct systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to ensure that they are indiscriminate.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limitation to applications for an automatic letter selection.</seg>
<seg id="28">Prohibition that political activists process full post-elections and envelopes of letter selections.</seg>
<seg id="29">Give the police the authority to set up lockouts for election stations.</seg>

<seg id="31">Taking pictures of photographing stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English can be used in the election stations (except Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensification of the training to ensure that the employees generally assert that voters go into the elective cabin alone.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after the Tower Hamlets case there was no penalty.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "the Electoral Court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices as incompatible," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">Due to a number of reasons, he was pleaded guilty according to the high requirements of the criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="37">"" "he also criticises the ineffective" "" "check controls" "" "of the election registration departments of the city halls." ""</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Eric said: "the court ruling in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.</seg>

<seg id="7">Beat him with the knee in the bar and turn, while the attacker slashes in front of pain, the weapon out of his hands. hit him with the run into your face and move backwards while doing the weapon on him.</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveler Ian Wright shabt for a guidebook his tongue at the dirtiest places in Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller undertook his immune system and throws a serious test by leaking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk put his train on a euro note, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing button of a draw toilet as well as a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before the indentation of each object he used a luminous ometer to show himself and us what he is going on.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought to check the flushing button of a draw toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately nothing left what he licked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resilience of his bowel by traveling through the world and ate strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public roads to train stations to dishwashers, the task proved to be the immune system definitely below a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "in the film he said:" "" "as a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and sludge water." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the movie he was able to live up to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its test strip showed a luminance count of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to that, the luminance number of freshly washed hands amounts to less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to reject after their luminance was over 4000 units while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," showing the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "this comes close to the worst thing I have smelled in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not lick here anything because it is disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company provides Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuoremaa says:" "" "we really wanted to offer consumers something new." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "we performed crazy brainstorming that ended that we said" "" "call us Ian." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put it in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film directing, added: "let me say it this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I told him to lick, just like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the movie."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to hulle them and others, in which this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty delicacies on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria, especially with the well-being of stomach and intestine, and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products containing lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asocial family left their social housing after a delogiance with a loss of £50,000 because it had terrorized their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Treviscock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After they were forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls had glowing holes, wood floors were torn, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is assumed that she is now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for house management at Cornwall Housing, said she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "It was a nightmare for people here and I believe people don't have to live in this way." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider as this property is probably considered not as beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and its reputation is also known.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted on street fighting with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive writing, disputes and curses.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, was in June an arrangement for anti-social behavior.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house, which will be torn down under circumstances, old rubbish was found</seg>
<seg id="14">In the estate where drugs were traded in the past, the wood floors were torn up</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours told that they had to fight them on the street and regularly invoked the police.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing delogiated her and her partner this week forcibly from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily surrender.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delogiation was cheered by lightened neighbours who said that their lives were made to hell.</seg>

<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have planned the family to cooperate with local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police was summoned at regular intervals for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the overgrown side of the church building, trash and old toys were thrown down</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he added:" "" "it is a shame that the lessee agreed to accept any responsibility for her behaviour and family, as delogizing is always the last step to consider Cornwall Housing." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be horribly seen for their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have given us the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will provide comfort to some neighbours and the message conveys that antisocial behaviour is not tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after delogizing on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers of the house administration will now need to evacuate garbage mountains surrounding the house</seg>

<seg id="7">This was reported to the team leader Kenias by the Doping Controllers.</seg>
<seg id="8">The IAAF World Federation has requested the IOC for information about the case to enforce its own investigations, shared an IAAF orator.</seg>

<seg id="18">The World Anti-Doping Agency had a great deal of pressure on the African country before the summer Olympics to create anti-doping law and a functioning control system.</seg>
<seg id="19">The law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic start.</seg>

<seg id="25">This was demonstrated by the fact that in this kind of sport it was used nationwide and systematically.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals do not get anything from the summer election campaign with - and the vacationers from North Rhine-Westphalia must not choose the country day.</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "" "" "until 2021, the Parliament election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">For it is not stupid to do so until now: summer holidays, heat and state-of-the-day elections - that bites.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be persuaded by the pivotees, are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the vacationers, who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee on the go, are not locals, so they are not allowed to choose the land tag.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: during the holidays, helpers, posters hang up, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and vote in the end, only laborious.</seg>
<seg id="9">By September 4, 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern still has to pass by election campaign against the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now in polls clearly behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strongly Neuling AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of coalition dust.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the country, spreads roses and chats a little with the people, just like his legendary eloquent predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.</seg>

<seg id="17">"" "her refugee policy, her" "" "We create" "" "accelerates the rise of the right-wing populists, which is now probably going to cost him the beautiful ministry." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU, with its top candidate, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you make an election campaign at the right time at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale production; Merkel's parliamentary group is located in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "there was probably the majority of other federal states," "" "said Vincent Coert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in NDR." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's too bad to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise, the Northeast CDU does not abandon the usual election campaigns at market places and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "that, so says Kokert, plays only a" "" "subordinate role" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "the Union has also noted that you are unleashing the base in the country that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people again." ""</seg>

<seg id="27">"" "however, the Council of the CDU voter cocoon to his comrades is self-exposing:" "" "you must go where it hurts, where people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Because there is much on the game, Sellering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed electoral campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls, the Socialists and Democrats were recently complaining with 22 per cent behind partners CDU (25) and just shortly before the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In the 2011 election, the SPD had clearly won 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, a small party with seven percent in surveys, are likely to make the leap into the land day.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of the necessity of holidays and move their electoral campaign largely into the internet.</seg>

<seg id="36">Instead, Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by Göhner, if there could be a financial compensation with the reference, the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27. now it must also bear the disadvantages that result from the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties where so much more generous has been handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">With all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been settled here since 1715, pointing to the long history.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys vinyl records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonesome middle-aged men love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">This statement derives from current data prior to submitting to the comment section. this statement derives from current data under the pseudonym of non-Allegre men's mediaeval age.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the reemergence of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in Millennials, which want to welcome the newness of physical objects, but to Midlife-nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight at the age of 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hormone by hobbyists - it has an emotional significance: older plate purchasers retain their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending alone time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov vote?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit and wildly decorated before I stop, hold my hands and say something crazy like: "so let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even if the heart of Soho slowly catches its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to evaluate their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, by Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) into the Reckless Records (number of data: eight men of middle age, a woman, probably around the 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already appreciate," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3.000 or 4,000 records.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), the walls of his living room suffer.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford than they appeared and to buy items that he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought was too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy boards are rather introverted and would like to spend some time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink too much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets can apply to YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pe, people who heard about the comeback and set themselves to buy their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I have conducted, people usually have been discharged from their collection in 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the supposed emotional importance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica, to realize that record stores have a calming community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers took advantage of the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to pull back to the stability of familiar vinyl covers, of objects that evoke happy jugenderings.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," "" "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">That's with me as a collector so I think it's so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to mentally deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like her social workers!" "" "a co-worker flutes from a pile-pile." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record in the last month have not yet joined them.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record, don't own a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At that time of the news report I would probably look very worried, while I smoothing through a pile of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (number of data: three middle-aged men) has noticed a "Trophy Aspect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone recently came up here and said," "" "I don't possess a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead record, so that I can put it on the shelf," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productively, less musically.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones, who are only slowly coming in.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has devoted almost a whole story to the vinyl records, has a colourful audience than I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and middle aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the aforementioned businesses - Wild Beasts latest synthesizer and sexboxed pop in place of experimental jazz groaned from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks odd, but convincing psychic traumas are hard to imagine when standing next to someone 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of boards for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a shopping spree than a wholesale purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserve much, so collecting plates is not a real option, it says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music from a computer or other way, but the beauty of records is... "it drives off with a diluted sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of disk lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I am releasing the jeans Hotpants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who group around Polaroid's cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter think about buying a crossover record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of panels of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one looks at them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative, some so far up that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "it is pure" "" "plate art." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items means more money for the industry and could send some customers into the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It's no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Although my research has shown that the results of YouGov are right, they, at least in record shops in Soho, do not take into account the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record shops and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with safety not strolling through the record shops of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while they avoid the gazing look of an uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter, who rises above the shoulders of middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional stores and restaurants in the Calais jungle where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a court hearing this week the authorities in Calais concluded that the state should be authorized to sell 72 provisional deals in which persons within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to Energydrinks, sell, or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais prefecture argued that these places were to be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy, from which no taxes would be paid and which have a fire and sanitary risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the state-backed association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that the provisional stores and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "a court in Lille ruled that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run the 72 provisional stores, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais" "" "are absolutely understandable." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer peaceful meeting between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places threatened by the decline was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is charitable and 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany's racers have to adapt to the next generation of velocity meters: in various federal states, among others in Hesse and Brandenburg, new flashes are being tested, which should be particularly effective.</seg>
<seg id="3">The futuristic reinforcement trailers of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden, for example, can be used at accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, on highway construction sites or to rehabilitated bridges with temporary speed polishes, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with speed limits.</seg>
<seg id="5">A permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reinforcement trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days with uninterrupted measuring operation, the case data are transferred encoded over a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can also be captured over several tracks at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limits as well as access bans by time, lanes and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to the manufacturer, the trailer can be moved in high-traffic condition by car with trailer hitch.</seg>
<seg id="10">So that it is not simply clapped, it is lowered in the measuring mode, so that the wheels in the armored and incidentally also sweat-proof outer shell disappear.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition, a built-in alarm system should protect the glitter from vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since 2015, the trailer has been tested according to information by Vitronic in various federal states and is now also used.</seg>
<seg id="13">Foreign authorities also blitz with the new technology: recently France has ordered 100 pieces, after an order of 150 copies last year.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at the 7-star Rugby came to an abrupt halt on Thursday evening with the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were defeated in Rio with a result of 43-7 in the decibels Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji gave a master class in handling, side-quilting, back-back, line-run and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medals of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was swept through the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Great Britain on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of that Fiji could have beaten a 15-man team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for UK - but it will probably not - that at least a Briton tomorrow will have a gold medal for his neck: Fijis boss trainer Ben Ryan, former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind it.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, she lost every game with Adelaide Sevens in Ryan.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they are lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This stage will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began amazingly and allowed the GBs to jump off from fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. to run in driving coaches. the World Series winners went up 5-0 to the top when Osea Kolinisau was rushing around in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With still four minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner he turned around.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A humiliating Tackle of Mitchell pushed the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa to achieve a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua went a touch down in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the reconnaissance and there was still more than a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Valto Ravouvou presided by further weak Tacklings of the GB team and rushed to the line to make a goal.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB is still learning.</seg>
<seg id="22">So it is also.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB caused major changes to half time and closed the fijian gap... for entire four minutes, which was good for the first half of the half until Joshua Tuisova underwent a brilliant interim play of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game was long in favor of the South Seas, whose fans sang, flags and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle rang, the Fijis hugged and GB kicked in the grass.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day Fiji Japan had defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 and Great Britain pressed South Africa in a tight semi-final match from the race - Great Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the bucks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late Tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the British 15-Aside team, secured the winning - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by battle with the trainer's cancer</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no more emotinal gold than with these games, and that will mean something.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first strokes to the last 220 harsh Hieve who go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in her golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if there were only those who sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the Echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was present when they rowed to the second Olympiagold in the second without a tax-woman, the first women in the history of British sports, who placed such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolute, after all, their 39.000 inert deployment, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant Athletins that glide across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the nature of the triumphal.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in the rowing there is a battalion of willing helpers who make a difference to the incremental advances that make the difference and there was no one more instrumental than the trainer who did not know if he was diagnosed with cancer this day.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, which is operating and that did it.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you don't do that, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky enough to start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if that was the right term under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money so I had to go better soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">That's how it starts.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is already a challenge, but this makes it an even bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of victory their first thoughts went to Williams who spent a nerve wrecking morning doing something more than usual and trying to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "panning, which was the main man in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said" "" "I was an emotional wreck this week. that's maybe something extreme, but it means so much." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It only repeats how much I mean, how much I and Helen and also Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we would be no one, so a massive thank you to him. he is the best coach in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have wished for a better person for exercising or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning didn't lose a race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 metres, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to stop, panning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very trapped in the moment.</seg>

<seg id="7">"" "the work of the Veitenstein Group was" "" "Bavarian" "" "as exemplary." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">Behind all this, Rupert Göller, who was 31 years old in the Kennel Association, stands for 28 years as Managing Director.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was now retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The drinking water-purpose association of the Veitenstein group based in Kottendorf, municipality Breitbrunn, transports approximately 150000 cubic meters of water annually and supplies 32 places and hamlets with approximately 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">Member municipalities are the congregations of Kirchhoff, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairman, Breitbrunner Bürgermeisterin Gertrud Bühl (FW), reminded that Rupert Göller was hired as a water-keeper in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Cleckverband in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organisational activities, budgetary planning, calculation of fees and contributions to urgent questions on weekends," said the chairman.</seg>
<seg id="15">As an outstanding event, it called the inauguration and inauguration of the new fountain (1994), land purchases in the area of the new fountain (1998) and compensation of farmers, the renovation of the high tanks (1999), the creation of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There has been no standstill and I have always received new additions, because water supplies life and drinking water is the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In their laudation, she praised Göllers loyal, reliable and correct service over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He used a lot of lifeblood for his water-purpose association and he lived quite well with the water-purpose association as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the successful concept of the Veitenstein group for nitrate reduction in front of the water forum of the Lower Franconia district.</seg>
<seg id="20">For this he received a lot of praise and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller, for his part, praised Water-wart Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best aqualkeeper and he was a faithful boy.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">As a highlight from his point of view, he described the well construction and the restructuring of the Zweckverband.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, the biggest challenge and the most difficult deployment were the pipe break at the high pressure tank at Kirchhof on January 3.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night so that the villages could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">Also the supply of Neubrunn can be maintained only once because one filled the high reservoir of Pettstadt with hoses.</seg>

<seg id="2">The crisis-packed and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional costs in millions of dollars.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that the industry threatened from green electricity subsidies are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It remains with the release of the renewable energy revolution in the existing systems for so-called own power production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday issue).</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "I am really glad that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Accordingly, the European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel producers who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.</seg>

<seg id="8">Gabriel said the WAZ, there is now a statement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators are replaced in the steel mills, an EEG change of 20 percent will affect.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even this is not raised in the steel industry.</seg>

<seg id="19">European manufacturers accuse price dumping Chinese steel companies.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring, the situation has eased a little more relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, import duties have been imposed on import-steel effects, on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have increased.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is not clear how sustainable the price recovery is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry leader Thyssenkrupp arrests cautiously on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least, prices would have stagnated.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">ThyssenKrupp finally did not want to exclude the closing of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">Around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.</seg>

<seg id="30">After a short increase in May the crowd went back for the second month in a row.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production has been around two percent below the previous year's figure.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing is good for seniors</seg>
<seg id="2">Singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp for her entire life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, she taught music in the school choir, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"sing me - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall lively, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good for her health and spirit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Since singing is a great hobby for seniors, Erhard Hackler says by the German seniors division.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most senior citizens sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular interaction, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "" "to speak and organize, to be able to rely on others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For in doing so, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand his lungs are not so quickly out of the puff in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if it comes to obtaining the sound of voice in old age, singing is an ideal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">For elderly people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Association of senior citizens.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations the common singing had a much higher significance, it belonged to everyday life, both at school and in leisure, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people arouses many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their adolescence.</seg>
<seg id="18">Due to lyrics and especially melodies, people with dementia are sinking into long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, the head also requires a special power, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">To concentrate simultaneously on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt oneself to the other singers - that's a major cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just elderly people who live alone are practicing not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition you hear through singing in the choir, Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem is also growing through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show yourself: if I practise for something long, I will get better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you want to try a new hobby, don't hesitate, even if you think you have little talent, Lenz says.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a sound comes next to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the right offer, senior citizens have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir, one can easily join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views of the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the church leader directly.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found via the internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help with the internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those who want to sing should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to all ages.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the facility in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will then increase once more, if appropriate improvement measures are needed.</seg>
<seg id="3">After an overlap calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will be at 4.37 euros per cubic meter.</seg>
<seg id="4">As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, at the approval of the budget Kulmbach noted that for these sanitation systems undercover works.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal bases, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the systems cost-effectively.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of October 1, 2016, the citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from World Greenwich Village, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to reach deeper into the purse.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Head of Administration Herbert Schmidt showed up the body, a new calculation of fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the period between October 2016 and September 2020, over- or undercover from the previous calendar period will also be compensated.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt founded the serious fee increases with the fact that there were relatively small facilities at all three sewerage facilities with a very low waste water attack, which was between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, expenditures for the necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact on the basis of the low distribution basis.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, sewage flow in all three plants is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, refurbishment and repair expenses were considerably reduced in all three plants due to their age of renovation and repair.</seg>
<seg id="14">The facility in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the plants for thighs, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt proved that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage in the Azendorf sewage plant.</seg>
<seg id="16">At the water pumping station, the nearly 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overhauled and the first sewage pond had to be extended after almost 20 years of operation, the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation option had to be installed in order to meet the water-legal requirements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "Schmidt:" "" "these extraordinary expenses came from the continued maintenance and maintenance costs, which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which in the previous year 2011 / 2012 were considerably below the current level.</seg>
<seg id="19">Steinmeier made it clear that in the three plants, the expenses for operation and maintenance were "full of smashing" in the three plants.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the past 20 years, Schmidt, the market town of large entertainment costs, has been spared.</seg>
<seg id="21">The situation for the aforementioned facilities will continue to remain precarious due to stone houses, particularly since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal wastewater-purpose association could not be extended by these facilities, because it is concerned with deficient institutions.</seg>

<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filtering tool, Snapchat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that already borders the absurdity.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are non-bloated, self-contained tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All missteps reach the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past where they were accused of using the app Blackface promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week suggested a filter to some users who gave them slit-eyes, false teeth and darker cheeks, some critics call a racist cartoon by Asians - "yellow-face."</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked themselves if these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and indignation were widely spread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced that it would have deactivated the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was thought to be an homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of injurious clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail grace Sparapani wrote, a Korean-American art student whose tweet was widely used across the photos that the filter was "hurtful and" uncomfortable. "</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the juxtaposition of a very contradictory Asian cartoonist and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellow-proof, but that the yellow-face has been moved to the ejecting extremity.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stumbling kite.</seg>
<seg id="18">The American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats big audience of young people - who are more diverse in the breed than their older counterparts - could rather assume that sensitivity is expected.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "if one of Snapchats creates a picture that is insulting for a user," "" "so it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed than it was before," "" "said Katie Zhu the 25-year-old Katie in an interview on Thursday." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for media and in a phone interview, she said that they believe that racial-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity among the recruitment practices in Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that has left Snapchat mostly unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures for the diversity of its staff and points to its status as a private company.</seg>

<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed consistent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence that government tips under Obama have given instructions to change reports, it shows how analysts exposed to pressure from their superiors, an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015 many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before the Congress were much more positive than the facts," "" "stated the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CentCom has publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin in April or May 2015.</seg>

<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings during the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of CentCom reports are underway by the Secretary General of the Ministry of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "in 2014 and 2015, the CentCom created an overly limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," "" "said the high-ranking democrat in the committee, Adam B. Schiff, in a statement." ""</seg>

<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday through "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon General Inspector, who were infiltrated by CentCom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press spokesperson, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on any reports of the Congress, while the investigations of the General Inspector are still in progress.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also admitted that" "" "experts sometimes have diverging opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data, and that intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these key issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a statement made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, last year's accusations have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of disagreements of more than ten years ago, as a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, a piece of writing about how the then government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, only foresaw a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker stated that contrary to the government statements of the government, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the terrorist group's financial situation, since these provisional refineries would have been put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, this recognition was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms's military commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature because of its disproportionately positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after having shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said that she couldn't remember that she had ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "I have no idea." "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">I am not one of the people who keep their goals in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, they know that: the American women are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the Britons in the first place, who remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final round of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two teams will get the first and second place in their group from six teams.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed will take a little longer for the strong Dutch woman to lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game might go out on Saturday, the American women have triggered a surprising confusion by their success story, four years after they ended up in the past London Games on the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey slayer in hands (her two older sisters played sports at Drexel University), with 16 years she became National Player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">They missed the Olympics in 2008, as they could not qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, in which for her and her team everything went wrong.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became a coach of the National Team, and thus the things began to turn to a better one.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "a change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," "" "said Bam." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the workload in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have been able to pull the rudder completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening, Bam opened the doorway in the first half of the game with a setback from the near area.</seg>
<seg id="20">India was gone without a victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the play from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the middle and leaped the ball into the gate to give the female a 2-0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the US, Jackie Briggs, who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a barrel.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the middle of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late as it is, it is the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Rio de Janeiro "events feel constantly and inevitably, a fast relay race between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself would be a burning rod, which is passed from the wristband to the swimmer to the turner for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour's conversation in the coffee shop without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Ledecker or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's black with dimples, could well have been among those known names that would be sent to Prime Time, if he were a swimmers, gymnasts, or even fencers.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the olympic trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports which are not universally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast-swimming and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I want to make a modest argument for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years have been so sparse that many people I questioned didn't know that there is at all an Olympic Port.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, there has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and until 2012 had won an athlete that made it to the final.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal this year from London.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain outsider character, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clownsschool as the one for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an experienced enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristic potential - the cartoonous tremors of his never ending impact - but also the graciousness of the gymnasium and diving, the two sports that essentially unites it.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging conquerors jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to turn a number of falling movements (turning, fencing and salting) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "according to the official" "" "Olympic programme" "", "they are evaluated according to performance, difficulty level and" "" "flight time" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists in their quest for gold have to go further, faster, up and down, sometimes to the finish, sometimes down and down, upwards and downwards at the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They not only chase the finish line or the output wall, but also in televised broadcasting a further higher goal: die Welt oder des Olympiarekords.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented pursuit is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it's enough to even stir one spectator into tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel somewhat tired when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a breathing break.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she jumps off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final rounds as part of a afternoon block from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">Amid the Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the fear and objectification of male athletes - as the male U.S. gymnasts recently proposed, according to The Wall Street Journal - Mr. Dooley expects his new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "demonstrators call for political changes in Ethiopia hit the government's violent resistance." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that the police killed dozens of protesters during clashes with the police.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia exactly interrupt?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But over the past few months protests against the government shook the country and spread more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people rushed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organizations, the government's response was cruel.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses testified that policemen shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos about the protests, probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security guards beat young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a hand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "the head of the UN Human Rights Council demands a thorough investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," "" "said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist hazards across the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if ever, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital of Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have consistently led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, and dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or prison, killed or driven into the expanse of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you suppress people and do not have any other options except to protest, it breaks out," "" "said SeYoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation is protesting.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold over the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a far criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front, or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, have been forced more or less forced in recent years to use the turmoil and re-arm themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are now exploded under the surface under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">In recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media as cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies hiding where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians admitted that they gathered themselves to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, the Amusas, coming from aethopia predominantly Christian highlands, prospered in politics and economy as they exploited the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are there to co-ordinate under a umbrella," said Mulatu Gemmosu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is strangely dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death on an unpublished illness in 2012 for 17 years in Ethiopia's Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to manipulate opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks this basic skill," "" "said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively obscure reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia had experienced such turmoil in 2005, after thousands of elections protested, which according to information provided by analysts were apparently blocked by the government and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the subsequent raids, many protesters were killed, even if they were less than in the last months and that time of unrest went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in fighting poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously, this did not prevent the intensification of the internal misconception of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnical form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month the protesters in Gondar, an amperian city, of Tigray managed businesses and the hatred towards the Tigray is becoming more common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests put the US and other Western allies in a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights to neighboring Somalia, even though it has recently concluded that it has closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West is clearly wanting to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump declared Obama's claim to ISIS was "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by angling that his repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "founders" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not serious.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions about the communications capabilities of the Republican candidate candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings its comrades who try to take care of him during an eventful phase, in the peculiar position to explain what he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">After he had made the suggestion at an electoral campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump broke back in relation to the claim on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to interpret, the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Tweet was contrary to the previous day Mr. Trump told in a series of interviews, he meant the accusation very serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomorphator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate wanted to know nothing about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism rushed down on Mr. Trump, while trying to direct the focus of his campaign due to falling demand values to the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">On Twitter he warned that Mrs. Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he drew strong criticism when he said the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but he later said, "Of course, I said sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then back to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans, how they arrive, and then" clarify "depending on how the reaction falls." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert that observes the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump adopted an even more etched note, as his survey values continued to decline.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist published on Friday showed a leading lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump tries not to apologize for his provocative statements, he frequently accuses his critics to distort his statements or to misunderstand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while strengthening the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign Mr. Trumps scissors have brought his loyal associates into the uncomfortable situation to stand to him, regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps most prominent advocates, gave himself great trouble to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," "" "said Mr. Giuliani about the correctness of Mr. Trumps statements about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had established the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">In this sense, it is true that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them ambushes, completely wrong, and so it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control.</seg>
<seg id="26">Prior to the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of running around on each of his words against him.</seg>

<seg id="1">Once upon the price of the market, Café in Greenpoint comes back</seg>
<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a skinny café in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash, which didn't have Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices from his Bedford Avenue store front were ousted.</seg>
<seg id="4">Soap Cherie shop, sold in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Local people smoked it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know, New York is change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is excluded and Verb is now a soap business."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is a change, then it is also new invention.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revitalised Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new club has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the club is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old café, the owner and managing director of the new café.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working at Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a client offered him to provide funds for a new exterior, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishes such as capers and saute onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural keys.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café doesn't serve beer anymore, but there are fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months, Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "many old customers were also displaced by prices from Williamsburg," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Recently Rebecca Oliveira was such a client.</seg>
<seg id="25">Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg in the past and regularly visited the club.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after having moved to Greenpoint, she would take the path.</seg>
<seg id="27">After the verb was closed, she gave up the coffee drinking for a while, she said.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "it became clear to me that it was at the coffee and the culture in the verb that was right to me," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="29">Now she drinks coffee, even if she ordered a Blended Chai Tea in place of her usual iced coffee, which is another new addition.</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Rosenthal has been a long-standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the club in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="31">He went there before the work and inevitably ordered the same.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "I came to seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Everything Bagel with butter," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="33">Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.</seg>
<seg id="34">Today Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his Everything Bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.</seg>

<seg id="1">Grönlandhai: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-sharks usually only come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to go back to the sea after an examination on board the research vessel Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats over the North Atlantic with a good 1 km / h until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grönlandharks will only receive offspring with 150 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely the Greenland shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean, in an hour it is on average just 1.220 meters far.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it matters, the five meter long animal accelerates to a full 2,6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle dominated by slowness, however, seems to be a godsend for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal "Science" at least of a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "insanity," "" "Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock describes this life-span, which means a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist assumed for a long time that Greenland became stonest.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland's sharks are hard to observe, finally they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear on the surface only in the winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland's sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">They measured their slow motion when they stopped six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They may chase sleeping animals or patrolling at the bottom of the polar sea and look for cadavers that swung out of higher water-layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland, fishermen between 2010 and 2013 brought to Greenland or Svalbard as a bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the biggest 502 centimeter was measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens nucleus of the sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens already arises before the birth of the sharks, the proteins in it are later no longer renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably much carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons attempts to loosen large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third-smallest animal with a length of 220 centimeters, the lens nucleus contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, which is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in its investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All larger Greenland hails had normal carbon-14-amounts in their lens nucleus, which is created by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493-centimeter-long Greenland shark, while the record-shark with 502 centimeters could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Grönlandhai-females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers of the length could assign an old age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and his age was determined with 156 years, Grönlandhaie with the multiplication obviously can be at least one and a half centuries time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This should also be a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methuses live mainly in icy waters is no accident.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211 year old Grönlandwal, in whose bacon on the neck a 120-year-old harpoon point, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the living animals often runs on a flame.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often very large.</seg>
<seg id="38">For the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal lives therefore more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as possible," "" "explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal should, on the other hand, invest its resources into a long life.</seg>

<seg id="5">However, the country was not listed among the countries that could be invoked directly from the hotel room.</seg>

<seg id="10">The answer he received there "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "the hotel employee said that the measure was a" "" "deliberate decision of the Kempinski Hotel management." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="18">This does not require any explanation.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "we expect the hotel to" "" "draw the right conclusions," "" "said the minister." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The incident triggered a rather large resonance on the Internet where people called the whole a scandal.</seg>

<seg id="22">"" "" "" "ashamed," "" "said it in another post, in which it was pointed out that the hotel, which is located at the posh Kurfürstendamm, is close to a synagogue." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministrants from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together, four stages were mastered.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time until the next romantic pilgrimage of all the ministrants in two years, the Oberministrantes round St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage destinations have been tested and finally decided in favour of the Episcopal city of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrim's destination was offered on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis from Bittelbronn, Greene, Haigerloch, and Heiligenzimmern were on the way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening before, Pastor Storost sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the Pilgrim Cross and informed the pilgrim blessing.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb we drove by train to the starting point of Villingen, where also a minster Unserer loved woman stood and so the pilgrim path from Münster was started.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening with a short impulse with various prayers, songs and texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the Minis also repeatedly played Rast to sing together a song from a specially assembled pilgrim song.</seg>
<seg id="11">The parishes of the local parishes were at their disposal for the nights.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the stage destinations Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller cared for a tasty and fortifying dinner and the breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">We continued on the second day via Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">After that, the stage was followed by the stage to St. Peter, which was the most exhausting stretch of road, but had to break down about 500 metres in high heat and then climbed again afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the evening, the deserved reward was a common barbecue at the lake's edge.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning pulse on the fourth pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter we went to the final stage to Freiburg.</seg>

<seg id="18">With a small impulse, God was thanked here.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the evening mass in Münster the minis of Kooperator Markus Obert were welcomed at the pilgrimage destination.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's call for Skinner last night in the men's team sprint in the Velodrom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor that his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy made himself to Eigen. the youngster made the legend proud when he rushed home to get a victory from the favourites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Four years ago England claimed a shocking victory while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they took a modest sixth place in March at the London Underground World Championships in spite of the resignation of Hoys.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in good time as a hindrance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoy's retirement has created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the Scots that now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindu, Kenny - four years ago with Hoy prevailed - and Skinner scored an Olympic board in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the Duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hindu was just back after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation, driving in a higher gear in order to slow it down and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked at his position as BBC expert and dropped Skinner, Kenny and Hinder when they climbed onto the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it's a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I am just here to do my best and to make myself a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We placed an olympic record in the final round and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph of 2012 at the side Kennys and Hoys, Hindi said that after a weak start he intentionally fell on the train.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection of England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an outstanding victory there was no such problem this time.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Hinder said:" "" "it feels like the whole UK flags at the tribune like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have joined together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We did so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win at the Olympics again.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which were won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If that is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the Velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form Kenny it is possible in the realm of the possibility that he repeated Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - who was exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a apparently holy date for British sports; on that day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">This would be the same by Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny will take part in the Sprint, which will start today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said," "" "I just enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "he said," "" "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51,942 at the finish.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won Gold in 2012, was at 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday he had argued with officials before the qualification as functionaries called him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women competition, which will continue and be completed tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in a world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on its strong track team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and win a band of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio have been shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">They played drama in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the middle of sex and bulbbing designs as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if one sees the first evening of the competition in the Velodrome, it looks as if the now legendary reputation GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, will be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium melts of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces of workers - are at stake, as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and that all supply contracts are eliminated, as the supplying energy company announced.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step was followed by the government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to the operation of the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years will expire in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa complex in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs -direct as well as indirect - could be at risk with a closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effect as the melt consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity production of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa closed the Point Henry melt, which led to a closure of Anglesea's power station last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The smelting of Alcoa in Portland loses its money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting pot with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three further owners will announce their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The facility is owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp share smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity by melting," "" "said the company." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "AGL continued to say that the contracts were so-called" "" "hedging transactions" "", "which should have entered into force in November 2016." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12 month notice period, so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "from this point, AGL assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenue," "" "said the electricity supplier." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on the earnings on AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong futures markets for wholesale prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "AGL announced that it had already written the value of the contracts in its annual sales amounting to $187 million in" "" "anticipation of a cancellation" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">Alcoa said that the decision to contract the Treaties, the "ability of Alcoas... to operate the smelting and to ensure the power supply to the melt" is not impaired.</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, who should have entered into force from November this year, even if it is still an explanation why it resigned from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn of the poor economic conditions of the industry prior to the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago facility near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to the analyst's statements at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland uses around 600 megawatts per year and around 900 megawatts of electricity per year.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Antonio, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder, ran to fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on her Instagram account.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to tears," Antonio wrote.</seg>
<seg id="5">The cover of Covers followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), a kripected reality video showing the entire Kardashian Jenner family (with the exception of Rob and Caitlyn problems) as well as in the presence of the most popular show biz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest.</seg>
<seg id="6">This represents the stereotyped plot almost every birthday septress of a children's programme (Seacrest brought the sentence: "you thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity somehow.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians began with certainty.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendal's big sister Kim likes her, as far as the Vogue cover is concerned (her and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is the most popular issue of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a girth similar to a fashion magazine, the output draws a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were from the 832 pages of the rolling 615 pages advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The revelation of his cover star is so eagerly anticipated that in the last two years pictures of the magazine were still leaked before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "in recent years there were clearly more" "" "celebrities" "", "the" "" "models, celebrities" "" "on the cover." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar prize winner and slide-brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga received the honour.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the small chance that Ms Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the former category, she is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or youngsters of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if everything applies to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, which appeared on the last cover, had with the release of Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course Jenners does not like success to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With their reality TV history, Jenners's position in the world of fashion has always been a bit tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized and called them "the misty of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings are boiled up again when the message came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But running around on the mess seems to pass by at the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is the cover of the September issue of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">It runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your primer of Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">They and all their sisters sell images of themselves on their respective paywall apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She sells her made pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.</seg>
<seg id="30">And in her free time she can see in reality TV. probably just to see her sister Kourtney and her children.</seg>

<seg id="5">In both federal states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue the head of the government.</seg>
<seg id="6">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent to 24 percent five years ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the survey, the party is just just ahead of the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">The third place is controversial between the left and the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="9">The left would come to 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the Landtag.</seg>

<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, so it was not good at hand.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was pretty clumsy.</seg>
<seg id="7">The built-in memory initially amounted to eight megabytes, which would range today for about two selfies with high resolution.</seg>

<seg id="9">"" "the" "" "Nokia 9,000 Communicator" "" "happened exactly 20 years ago, on 15 August 1996, in stores - and it was the first smartphone." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">For a few euros, fans can still buy the equipment on the internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age.</seg>
<seg id="11">20 years ago, the communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hannover as "office in western pocket format."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone could be sent and received for those standards: SMS and e-mails were sent and received, also by fax the communicator was to be reached.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even the access to web pages was possible by HTML browsers, albeit tormented slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded similar to a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The price was rather proud: 2700 D-Mark, thus about 1400 Euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average retail price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody could suspect in August 1996 that communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything is different.</seg>
<seg id="22">The smart phones are a success story though not for Nokia.</seg>

<seg id="24">Today, vendors dominate the market, all of which came much later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">Being online anytime and anywhere is everyday for a lot of people.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="27">About 1.4 billion devices were sold, Samsung and Apple alone account for 555 million units.</seg>
<seg id="28">Worldwide sales with the equipment is roughly 400 billion euros.</seg>

<seg id="3">The police call witnesses after a woman was transferred to a highway in the early hours of the morning at a presumed suicide of several vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">A woman lay in the dark "in an act of desperation" on the street and were hit by several cars, the police said in Vaud.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is obvious that at the age of 49, a Swiss guy who was handed over by several vehicles, including a lorry, wanted to kill himself.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the projections of a new NASA air amodel, Venus was probably inhabitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies by NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus on the basis of tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine if the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere could once have had ground-like conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists first pointed out that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and still slowly turned on.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably showed more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protect against fast evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus is exposed to its daily horizons of the sun for almost two months," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts as a umbrella, to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures which are some degrees cooler than those of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus, which resembles the evolution previously assumed by planetary scientists.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably inhabitable, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of billions years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was blown away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">When their hydrogen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide came back with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, as we know it today.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler World Telescope helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates under the stars of the star cluster of the Pleiades.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help astronomers understand why stars are rotating in stargates at different rates, and in what context the rotation periods are related to the resurrection of the planet.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other stargates, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The star cluster of the Pleiades is 445 light-years away from the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this cluster of stars, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now turning the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak rotation rates, these mature stars stumble large amounts of star-winds.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since these winds are travelling through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star fails, its rotation rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- such as sunspots --.</seg>

<seg id="8">Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will be working as a consultant and youth coach at full salary.</seg>

<seg id="6">The Chinese swimmering Chen Xinyi, 3000 metre obstacle runner in Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were positively tested and ruled out in Brazil - immediately before the start of the already critical athletics competitions these messages come to an end.</seg>
<seg id="7">Last Sunday Chen has been demonstrating the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Friday afternoon, the International Sport Court CAS confirmed its expulsion from the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18-year-old had the fourth place in the finals over 100 m of butterfly, only around 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday Chen should have participated in the preruns of more than 50 m of freedom style.</seg>

<seg id="13">For the first time in history no longer the IOC, but the CAS is responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also in the night of Rio the news leaked over the positive rehearsal at Danakowa, the 33-year-old went on himself to the offensive.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," "" "this was an incredible shock," "" "she said to the Bulgarian TV station BNT." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "she was innocent," "" "The only explanation could be nutritional supplements," "" "said the Athletics Athletics." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, it should act on the banned substance of the EPO blood doping agent.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danakowa was provisionally suspended, according to BNT, the B sample should have had a positive effect.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgaria's Prime Minister Boyko Borissov immediately announced his criticism of the athlete.</seg>
<seg id="20">"I don't understand why athletes do not draw the right conclusions," he said: "we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, all weightlifters from the chronically doping nation must not take part in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "on Friday, the case" "" "Adrian Zielinski" "" "was also known, the London Olympic Champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested three days earlier on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Both deny the intake, however, both may not start in the class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before the athletes start, Danakowa's case is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The IAAF World Federation had prohibited the complete Russian crew except for systematic doping, even the Kenyan women's nation produced numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, in the swimming-sport, the previous clubs in China also provided fierce disputes between the athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">Thus the Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic Champion Sun Yang harsch.</seg>
<seg id="28">"sun Yang pinkelt lila."</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "when I see the podium above 200 m of freestyle, I want to hand over myself," "" "said Lacourt in French radio." ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: so perfide blackmail hackers their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Blackmail programmers are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey conducted by the Anti-Defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months were at least once, sometimes multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of ransomware extortion.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom required by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The offenders specialize their blackmail software according to the observations of Malwarebytes on attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially unsatisfactory ransom is significantly higher than for private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of the malware," "" "explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most Malwareprograms were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the target, but the change to company attacks took place in the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works for a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim, it searches for recently modified files like Word, Excel or database files as well as after archives of pictures and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and clears the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the demands of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the end-key code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of the cryptocurrencies Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where the personal photo database is at stake in private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production still stands.</seg>
<seg id="17">Correspondingly higher the damage occurs when a ransomware hits.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 per cent of the German companies affected reported losses due to Ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely interrupt their business operations, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany there were already several hospitals victims of attacks whose patients can be threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims: don't pay, you only support the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay will get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators in the face of downtime in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know that and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In an up-to-date study, the safety researchers of F-Secure have investigated the user-winning areas and contact with the blackmail and come to the result: the perpetrators actually try to build a kind of customer service in order to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims by chat on how they can pay by Bitcoin, set free accessible support sites or decrypt free sample files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euro, companies must partly negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively risk-free gains from the ransomware recovery, the hackers are becoming more professional and sharing the job, says safety expert Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a ransomware circa within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">But it is more likely that these are three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software construction kit to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previously malware kits have been created by purchasing malware, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "included in delivery is an adaptation tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," "" "says Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackjack then searches for further hackers to spread the newly bought software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logs in one of the forums underground, buys the set from a criminal and asks another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made by certified calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually the criminals then commission spammers with the spread," "" "explains Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known among many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of the companies IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey rely on repairing Ransomware by means of file back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful seizure, the perpetrators threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," "" "explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Depending on the type of data, the damage potential is much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In future, the perpetrators could henceforth take completely new targets on the internet of things to the grain.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the decon hacker conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the activation of such a blocked heating could certainly be a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="23">The full connectivity is available only for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and one HDMI jack are under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome.</seg>

<seg id="2">It stalls regularly on the circumferential road - here a picture of November.</seg>
<seg id="3">But this should change: the law of law shall be extended.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is a good news for all car enthusiasts who are standing in traffic at the traffic road every evening in traffic jam when they ride over the motorway junction (A 43).</seg>
<seg id="5">On the coming Tuesday and Wednesday (16 / 17 August), road construction extends in the area between Hammer Street and Weser Straße in the right-hand bending track by 700 meters.</seg>
<seg id="6">Drivers can then thread directly from the hammer road to the right.</seg>
<seg id="7">The big advantage: the traffic is splitting early, whereby the overall passage of the traffic is improved on the busy section of the Bundesstraße 51.</seg>
<seg id="8">The idea with the extended exit had the CDU group in the district's representative Münster-West.</seg>
<seg id="9">The track narrows on the feeder to the driver, especially between 17 and 19 o'clock.</seg>
<seg id="10">On weekdays, the backlog goes up to the bridge over the Albergo trail and sometimes even beyond.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips for sleeping disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening you roll around forever, at night you are awake for hours, and in the morning it is far from the wake-up ring no longer to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of the adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How to express sleeping problems or sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many reasons underlying them, stresses Hans-Günter Voting, member of the board member of the German Association for Battalion and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one understands inland, however, is the insomnia, i.e. a single and dormant disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just sleeping many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, board member of the German Dental Association with practice in Varel in Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep problems?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind this, organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also medicines are stuck.</seg>
<seg id="12">Infrequently the sleep disturbance is an expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is especially common in depression," "" "says Weak." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that various factors condition each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, those who have a herniated disc can be bad, wake up every two to three hours and possibly begin to salute about everyday problems and worries, there is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I go to the doctor with sleep problems?</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is compromised in the day should go to the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">The depression can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, sleepy, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate sleeping disorder, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medicines - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquestion.</seg>
<seg id="22">There is scarcely serene sleeping medicine in Germany, emphasises Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary dorm medical center of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, in case of sleeping problems, one should first turn to the GP, advises the weft.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified with investigations, whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For example, for the examination in the sleep laboratory, doctors advise, for example, in snoring with respirators, in case of ill-fatigue, sleepwalkers or if one does not find the cause of a sleeping disorder, Fibao explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "only please do not make lunch," "" "says Fibao." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After covering, one goes to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-glasses, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera draws on the sleeping end on the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a few adjusting screws which can be used for better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Walking counts on: regular sleep and stopping times, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, not watch TV for falling asleep, avoid alcohol and do not look at the clock at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that is quite and at all not conducive to.</seg>

<seg id="2">Professional thieves at Düsseldorf Airport</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, the police officers of the Düsseldorf Police arrested two women and two men aged 50 to 61.</seg>
<seg id="4">The suspects had committed several handkerchiefs and baggage-steels as a banker.</seg>
<seg id="5">At 21.30, civilian officials in the area of the Düsseldorf Airport recognized a gang known to policemen from past theft charges.</seg>
<seg id="6">The two women and two men have committed several offences since mid-July and have been collectively, socially and professionally.</seg>
<seg id="7">The experts of the Police Inspector 34 can demonstrate four actions that have been submitted specifically to the protection of criminal offences in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="8">They had captured a total of over 15,000 Euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "old buildings, a few linden trees, in between a rest of cobblestones: the Riga Street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like this, but the police are among the" "" "companions" "" "of the city." ""</seg>
<seg id="2">Passing the road from east to west, one passes playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a biolade.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "someone" "" "ugly!" "" "sprayed on the façade of a gray house." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Compared to a Lidl, which will soon be torn down, a house with high windows and 133 new tenants will be built here until 2017.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "articles about this" "" "trendy neighborhood" "", "as the competent real estate company Friedrichshain calls, will be billed with burning cars in recent weeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have lease agreements, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin interior senator, Henkel had spoken out several times for a hard action by the police against the project, the area designated as a "no-go zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On June 22nd, the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, had been cleared with 300 police officers, patrolled the police three weeks according to official statements, with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, blocked sections of the road and stopped visitors to enter the house with number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, building workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown owners of the house.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers moved under the jubilation of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon, the road works peacefully: parents go for a walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk about late Späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house-projects there is a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main orge of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, which raises three children here, is mainly irritated by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern for increasing rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a Kiez, who predominantly wanted police protection against vandaliatory left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch that the Berlin internal senator and the police between the occupying occupants and their neighbors do not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class quarter, which today has a low average income and high risk of poverty in comparison to the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Street close to the Riga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was evacuated under a large police force in a real road battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Riga area and are still inhabited by the people who had been occupying them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the city district has become increasingly magnet for tourists and suffiants from all over the world over the past few years: now residents of GDR times and former homeowners share their neighbourhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable in the rents, which have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rīga are attacked as symbols for this development: you can recognize them on inserted disks or freshly painted façades that were thrown with colour bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other road was mentioned this year together with the words" "" "left-alone force" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason for not all neighbours to see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by criminality: crimes like body injury are according to statistics almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the crimes are causing damage that tend to meet newbuildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a tenant house for 17 years next to the controversial 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">When it comes to violence, it is important: people in the 94 are their neighbours who did not have been.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the Riga region anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has deliberately moved to the Riga Street - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was so important for her to get back to her streets: from the police, politics and the media, who suddenly claimed the city of Germany in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of inhabitants such as Neugebauer, the street will continue to be taken away: through obverse new buildings in former mosquitoes, which displace the old residents.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are ultimately condominiums that are not interesting for many, but here are rather people who are not so well searched," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I am absolutely not able to avert violence and destruction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should I do if someone never listens to it?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the residents.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer hated little understanding for those who were angry about colour bombs: the house-projects and the left-hand scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who come from should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub area, can complain about noise there.</seg>

<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the refugee advisor for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social educator supports the team of the administration of Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact person for all actors: refugees, group of refugees, administration, authorities and anyone else involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine client of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than thankful that Deuschle is there, the vanishing Wollmilchsau, which has a problem above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">In this way, some - less mocking but rather targeting the multitude of desired areas of responsibility - meant that the administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">Looking for an administrative specialist with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long experience in the field of social work, just an exhausting Wollmilchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, Annika Deuschle writes.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organisation, work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent job for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine client that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time players." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">You must submit the refugees in their own or rented premises.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must bear the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Board of Agriculture to Commune and Jobcenters.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It does not work until now, if one is dependent on private dwellings, Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common apartments must be infamous as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will soon be installed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a firm residence there are internships, apprenticeships, school courts, one-euro jobs and support activities for refugees and migrants who need to be found or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "more places would be good," "" "reports Regine client." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help homework, do charitable work - and that motivates and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no employment therapy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not mean only work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day need a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I need offers like sports, contacts with locals and above all language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So here, administration and volunteers also jump here.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They have to explain to the refugees that it takes a long time and they can bridge the time wisely, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Who at some point develop the feeling that he can't help in Urbach, do not work and be useless, he will never integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "but there are problems too," "" "says customer honest," "" "people with nothing at all." "" "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "mammoth task." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two after the recent occurrences fear of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine client quite clearly" "" "what some may call naive." "" "a residual risk can and does not want to exclude them." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitised.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassins would complete them completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "says Regine client." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main and honorary officials have to look out for activities in the region and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They have always in the background that a new shock of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, politics abhors.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to put them helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach, we have not yet arrived where we want to go," Annika Deuschle says.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine client also makes it clear that the Urbachs are already busy to integrate the existing people sensibly.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently about 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But if people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
