Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as T@@ eher@@ an &apos;s destabili@@ sing action in the Middle East .
at the meeting , however , it is also meant to deal with the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington is critici@@ zing the ongoing settlement development of Israel and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
the deal with the Iranian nuclear program wor@@ sen@@ ed by Obama has wor@@ sen@@ ed the relationship between the two .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu has held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republi@@ can before the US Congress , which was partly considered an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not talked about with Obama , a meeting had refused this election to Israel with reference to the election that was im@@ min@@ ent in his time .
in an emergency call Professor to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb reported with a somewhat z@@ itt@@ led voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
Lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; cute dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone .
inside the house the officials found the cor@@ p@@ ses of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand written note that was ch@@ ained on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I could undo it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman I ever loved . &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds , where , according to the police , he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Political leader Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard shooting at 10 : 18 clock .
he said that Lamb killed the fatal emergency call at some point .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took his life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after sho@@ ot@@ ings at the university , forcing students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get an idea of what Lamb is motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said that they were looking forward to their lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal pre@@ history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students attended courses of both .
at the same time , there were some tendencies towards problematic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 he had to deal with stress .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he only taught two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard , would not give him any guarantee for an automatic road to an employment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s imagination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after fle@@ eing from campus , the police found Lam@@ bs later when he came back to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about one mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ yl Johnson .
his car was still running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that he believed that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb was growing up in the area .
Lamb opened his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a town with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he completed his doctorate in ped@@ agog@@ y in the spring .
one of the long @-@ standing friend@@ ships Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through common friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar playing .
at that time he was the women &apos;s flock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls mel@@ ted when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and resident in the Jackson city of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call , Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no document of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said that they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues .
Lamb hit Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail performed both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse , who worked online for various companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a fe@@ eb@@ le lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 . September for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and oral harmon@@ ica before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , conducted the first semester program and specialised in American natives and colonial history , &quot; said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
around 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community at a candle light commem@@ oration ceremony .
Sch@@ mid@@ den &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vi@@ gil , while the Univers@@ itä@@ tsch@@ or &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be res@@ um@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Rog@@ eli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associ@@ ated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb made the call after he shot him , and that he described Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife in his emergency call , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
go R Us plans to hire less workforce for Christmas time
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go R Us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says that it won &apos;t last as many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company said it was planning to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centres throughout the country . 45@@ ,000 workers were hired during the Christmas season in 2014 .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with job interviews this month and the number of employees increases from October to December .
while the holidays are still months away , the Christmas business is approaching , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to furnis@@ h stores with employees who sell , send and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox is jo@@ king over his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of Back to the Future was a big moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we were sitting in the theatre waiting for the ro@@ y@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty and I am gradually real@@ ising that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated crow@@ ning and a length of arms from being with the Princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; was premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest time travel film ever rot@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cin@@ emas in October .
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UN chief ur@@ ges once again all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution .
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , UK and France - on the ver@@ ge of the meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he depl@@ ored that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban has called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 survey values that show that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed it as a joke .
and some wait for a breakdown .
but no matter how some Rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the top ranks in poll@@ s down@@ wards , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys demonstrated Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of the real estate mo@@ g .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tru@@ mp will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at this time , in 2011 , Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , of which none of them won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognise Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s per@@ sever@@ ance and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values , indicating that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
trump@@ s Pop@@ ular values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his can@@ did@@ acy mid @-@ June , a survey by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positively .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six of the 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures hold themselves in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a pol@@ l of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans said they would be either &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enthusiastic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; happy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Tru@@ mp was nominated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two out of ten say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Ben Car@@ son manages roughly the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excited &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next one in matters of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters say that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans does not see Tru@@ mp@@ s Temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters ten@@ ding to the rep@@ ublic@@ ans believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , says ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the first electoral country of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to execute his office effectively , and almost six of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament did not fit into the White House , so ABC / post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they expose their schol@@ ar hats , republi@@ can vot@@ ers Tru@@ mp hold Tru@@ mp for real .
when asked who best wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a pol@@ l from CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four of ten say Tru@@ mp is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four out of ten put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full Dis@@ closure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at that time in the last cycle , four of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination versus just 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a variety of GO@@ P voters can see Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered for another candidate , Tru@@ mp is still beating almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Tru@@ mp@@ s leadership while the anti @-@ Tru@@ mp support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp is re@@ ap@@ ing the majority support .
he has scored 13 points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ iss and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a tight majority of Donald Tru@@ mp fans say they have formed their minds .
a new C@@ BS / NY@@ T survey on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Tru@@ mp are saying that they have firmly committed their votes .
of course much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind .
46 percent said that they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
yet Tru@@ mp@@ s is the strongest competi@@ tor at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but vot@@ er who say they have formed their opinions are twice as frequent for Tru@@ mp .
six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration .
since Donald Tru@@ mp stated in his election campaign two months ago immigrants from Mexico &quot; rape &quot; was the immigration pi@@ vot@@ al and pi@@ vot@@ al point in the public discourse on 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic failure of Tru@@ mp will hold decisive His@@ pan@@ o Americans away from the Republi@@ can party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post pol@@ l from Monday , six of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on questions of immigration .
so long as immigration remains in the spotlight , Donald Tru@@ mp seems to do too .
fru@@ stration above the government climbs to new levels .
meanwhile , about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters is accounted for by Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son , above all through their out@@ sider status .
six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new Monday @-@ Survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience .
and they are also mad at Washington .
a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa , two weeks ago , shows that three of four I@@ owa Republi@@ can Rep@@ ublic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated at 54 per cent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ factory &quot; and 21 percent &quot; fer@@ vent . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential districts in Germany
here in the Hob@@ by@@ en@@ weg you find the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the Nord@@ se@@ ew@@ att .
a square meter in the street costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros on average in the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which particular locations one square meter is the most expensive .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top places of living , however , one of the prices is above Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the estate service provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euro - per square meter , well marked .
but well , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here as an exception .
champi@@ ons League : Bayern @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
double Tor@@ ri@@ cher in Pi@@ raeus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy result of Thomas Müller made the way to FC Bayern the way to a deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ raeus - then ran it .
a supreme pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
the world champi@@ ons Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e have embark@@ ed on a dream start to the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; in the witch vessel of Pi@@ raeus .
the team of trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record master Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Götz@@ es hits ( 8@@ 9th ) deserved with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth start @-@ up in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola wants to finally get the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
Müller was rewarded with his 28 hits in the Champions League to the Bavaria @-@ leadership of the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto , who had left an imag@@ inary shot of the world champion .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate her , &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ m promised before the play at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based speeches .
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea without exc@@ itation .
Pi@@ raeus had won his youngest six home games in the royal class , among them against well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 , Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) stum@@ bled here .
but Bavaria , defeated in seven European Cup du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they ran bol@@ dly , but often too resour@@ ceful for their offensive efforts .
the attacks were often initiated by mod@@ al shift on the left @-@ hand Douglas Costa , which was rarely seen against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right when his flan@@ k penet@@ rated from the right half @-@ field in the upper left corner of the gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half were Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , when Olympia @-@ storms Ide@@ a Brown struck the Polish head@@ ball from the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct pick @-@ up , the go@@ alie Roberto was par@@ ked with his knee ( 35 ) .
although the Bav@@ arians raised their hab@@ itual play , Pi@@ raeus could put a needle &apos;s needle .
however , on go@@ al@@ keeper Manuel Neu@@ er was reli@@ ance .
for example , when he ste@@ ered a shot of ide@@ ye across the lat@@ ent ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola left a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the center near Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who did it well .
Mario Götz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the ca@@ vern , was sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero only gave the green light after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports officer Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever wants to make something else from it is already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
i@@ dol arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller added another one .
in front of the game it had come to Kra@@ w@@ alle in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly mut@@ ated Bayern fans had obviously provoked the supporters of host Pi@@ raeus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went against the Munich followers .
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was injured from the stadium .
smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs but also the teeth - this suggests a long @-@ term study .
good news : when you opt @-@ out , the risk is reduced rapidly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this comes from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to exceed 2.5 to 3.6 @-@ fold .
the scientists had observed more than 23@@ 300 participants .
major causes of tooth decay are c@@ aries and inflamm@@ ations of the gum , emphas@@ ises the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , stress the authors .
the link between smoking and loss of teeth therefore goes back to frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take more than ten years until the endanger@@ ing came back to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , explained Er@@ stau@@ tor Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Smo@@ king said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Smo@@ king reduces life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , also leads to good dental health up to a high age .
in Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 was affected by too@@ th@@ lessness , the DI@@ f@@ E shared .
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking reduces the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study confirms the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists encounter the remains of the late Anti@@ quity in Cologne Rhein@@ h@@ essen
archaeological finds were made at the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the repeated time .
in the vicinity of the building site for the new Rhine Boulevard , archae@@ ologists from the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction works on the Rhine , historians are looking for so @-@ called bottom monuments .
for all building projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always consul@@ ted as a specialist department for archaeological excav@@ ation .
in the third part of the Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists have now been found .
it was already known from text documents that at the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century a church stood , explained Trier .
in addition to remains of the fortress and the church tower , a cemetery with around 350 graves was discovered , which probably belonged to the church .
young woman captured by freight train
after a young woman is injured at the railway station in the Gei@@ ste@@ er@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ ders , the Federal Police is asking the population for help .
early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 pm the woman crossed the train station towards the station building and was captured by a freight train coming from the direction of Mön@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach .
due to the acquisition of the train , she carried out serious injuries by the Federal Police .
she was treated as a not@@ ary on the spot and brought to a hospital by rescue workers .
on the basis of the noc@@ tur@@ nal crossing of the young woman there are no re@@ ali@@ zations to the medi@@ ating officials .
the incident was potentially witnessed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .
there are residents or pass@@ ers @-@ by from Lin@@ der@@ ner Bahn , Bri@@ ck@@ bak@@ eries , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ straße and Lei@@ f ar@@ ther Straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) .

EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TT@@ IP
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to shar@@ pen the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement TT@@ IP , the European Commission has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system which , in its function , corresponds to more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens can trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in the presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swedish decided to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
TT@@ IP aims to create the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration act con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely to the fact that the EU states and the US have jointly selected independent judges for a new &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Investment Court &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are to come to equal parts from the EU , the USA , and third countries .
for the first time it is envis@@ aged for a second instance .
it would allow it to obj@@ ectively rise against judgment .
until now , the parties agreed with each other to arbit@@ ers , and there was no obj@@ ections to their judgments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the debate over the past few months , it became clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , she wants to work towards an international investment court .
there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clari@@ fied .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings demanded mainly by large corporations ( IS@@ DS ) are considered one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel judi@@ ci@@ ary , over which companies can make damages to tax@@ pay@@ ers , le@@ ver@@ aging national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organizations like Camp@@ act described the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was especially critic@@ ised that they should not apply for the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German Economic Secretary Matthias Mach@@ mad ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as great progress .
the Commission considered important points in the reform that Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sig@@ mar Gabriel had worked out with other EU trade ministers in the spring .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European company B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against limiting the economic action of the economy by too many new rules .
in this way , particularly small and medium @-@ sized companies could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
when talks on the Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ( TT@@ IP ) agreement can be concluded , it remains unclear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US .
originally a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year .
this date is deemed to be no longer valid .
delicate Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on the stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy appearing folk singer has recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost gri@@ pped by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells of different places he always records on the map , about his meticul@@ ous and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they originated and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has been proving to be a wonderful creative irrit@@ ation .
with the 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State &quot; smart composed songs seem to be very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can also drift into great opul@@ ent parts at any time .
the rum@@ our of &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an &quot; would be the first part of a dar@@ ing series : each of the 50 U.S. states should be in consequence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and in the Rhine the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already appeared and breaks out positively . &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens will be reduced here .
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician living in New York returned to the show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) a comprehensive masterpiece is published in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bor@@ edom with ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is not in any season list of influential music media .
after extremely productive experim@@ enting , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively electronic sales pieces .
this sixth decent studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effects and rever@@ b .
long ago the smaller clubs got off , the stage shows here become the colorful spectacle of ne@@ on forehead @-@ bands and large fluorescent stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five member band .
in the glo@@ om@@ ily held ham@@ burger more !
he mainly presents the &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; available since March .
although here nearly 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the clearly mature sten@@ ch returns to intim@@ acy and to folk .
without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians plays through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one hears from the audience : the talk is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and one can therefore disc@@ ard the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; record basically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only for an en@@ core , St@@ ev@@ ens hum@@ bles himself , plays acousti@@ cally few older songs and finally dec@@ lines under ro@@ aring appl@@ ause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gest@@ unde
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gest@@ unde is eag@@ erly awa@@ ited
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is scheduled to make his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ gest@@ unde , and for the first time he will be joining David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to face the first of his six pres@@ et questions shortly after mid@@ day , while his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs from nearby .
he called for &quot; fewer theatres and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary audi@@ ting for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , because after his appointment she will be a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent in silence during a commem@@ oration ceremony on the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain on Tuesday is provoked by a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the heart of several front pages stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision to not sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a comment by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had been &quot; in respect@@ ful silence &quot; and he recognized the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England .
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , spoke in the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independently &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they were called upon differences in business , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party originally supported him as leaders .
the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences within Labour are st@@ acked , following Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s remarks on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that Labour changes take place to remove the whole idea of a limitation altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow worker and pensions minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to cut the limit of £ 26.@@ 000 to £ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron , ever since he is a T@@ ory leader , across the Dis@@ patch box in Parliament over the past decade .
the Labour leader , who has promised another policy approach , says he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and given him more than 30,000 ideas .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the set @-@ up of the prime minister is too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he will refrain from both &quot; perc@@ ei@@ ving &quot; and stri@@ kers with re@@ perc@@ ussions and has instead decided to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic ministers , will represent him if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally took the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the House of Commons , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Jud@@ y of Jud@@ y &quot; who was often associated with the set @-@ up of the Prime Minister . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television in 1990 , the Fra@@ gest@@ unde was viewed with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the verdict of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his Par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and needs far @-@ reaching reforms .

pound boo@@ sts faster wage growth in the UK
the pound jump@@ ed rapidly , according to data , which showed an increase in the wage growth of the United Kingdom . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ BM@@ iller bid goal .
between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared with the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest and quick@@ est assessment since 2009 over the time of an increase in interest rates .
the pound rose by more than 1 % from the dollar to $ 1.@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 index reached 6.@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after taking over offer of Riv@@ alen AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the two biggest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands like Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry stocks were higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core rose by 5 % after the mining industry said that it took 2.5 billion $ by a stock sale as part of its debt reduction strategy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the shares of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.3 % decline after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his estim@@ ation for the company rating on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; selling &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % after the sports clothing company reported a pre @-@ tax profit of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
the head of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages thre@@ aten the expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labor costs in his company , he says .
the cost could hit the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs .

PE@@ GI@@ DA poster brings Leban@@ ese into the idea of the potato we@@ eter
potato or d@@ öner ?
these are both - in the potato @-@ we@@ eter , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger joint owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the expression &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ öner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay has put potatoes and meat together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potatoes instead of twe@@ eter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he saw by chance on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , there is a barbecue sk@@ ewer , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
the idea of the Leban@@ ese has now been registered at the Patent Office in Munich .
according to the authorities , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
therefore , how much meat and how much potatoes contain the sk@@ ewer , Al@@ hay does not want to betra@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the culinary international understanding also goes well with its customers .
met@@ al@@ oma launches campaign for the fight against Al@@ di@@ -
Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA stores in front of an Al@@ di invasion in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a ground stand campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailer in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing through social media , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
I@@ GA dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice manufacturer S@@ immo from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and shop owners who sell approved tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish more details of its defence strategy on 29 September when the wholes@@ aler of food , alcohol and equipment goes through its annual investor strategy day .
there is a lot in the game , as South Australia and Western Australia make up nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins than met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the eastern states .
purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern states .
analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will grab some five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after opening its first markets , and will take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailer could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di has opened 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in every market .
the loss in food and food business and amounts on met@@ c@@ ash@@ s of a high fixed @-@ cost base could cost about $ 13 million profit before interest and tax , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly at Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recently conducted Roy Morgan survey found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley estimates that Met@@ a &apos;s sales in food and food business will fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business lunch in Melbourne that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash refused to publicly respond to the comment by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a member of the board of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr. Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ AS &apos;s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ a &apos;s food and food trade , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting operational debt reduction in terms of both revenue and margins .
the wholes@@ aler , however , inv@@ ests and inv@@ ests more than 150 million $ to equ@@ alize sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and to improve I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores by faster growing fresh foods and delivering a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s chief executive director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and loading programs to El@@ an are expected to grow and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm surrounding his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ z , and according to the President of the Australian tennis Federation Steve He@@ aly deserves praise for his own behaviour .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented duo , which is often referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; fell into the spotlight by the not@@ orious battle of Kyr@@ gy@@ z with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison going out : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat Kyr@@ gy@@ z , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was recently watched as he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cr@@ amp ran a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m pretty busy is the fact that after my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi was drag@@ ged into the fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost in the US Open because of a cr@@ amp , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he has been treated a little too strict .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he has never had any problem with the other players , he will never have a problem with the other players , he &apos;s good in shape , he &apos;s good in shape , he &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not consider Kyr@@ gy@@ z at an important preliminary decision , which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term fixed component to the team . &quot;
&quot; first , we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all of the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly .
and I believe that Nick has quickly made the rise to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the spotlight , in which he can only think about it , I consider appropriate , and it is best for the team and it is the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the emergency and marked the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those trying to illeg@@ ally enter the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants trapped in a no @-@ man &apos;s land , and Ser@@ b officials re@@ acted with indign@@ ation .
the people who had fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but fru@@ strations increased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter flo@@ ated over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried ins@@ ults against the Hungarian police police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some expelled food and water from protest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary were sent back while more and more come from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there must be discussions with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came one day after the 28 @-@ Nations bloc with a controversial meeting in Brussels , no common immigration policy could be agreed .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the shr@@ unken Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the next month or the end of the year , an agreement would be made that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
however , Hungary did not hope for a spe@@ edy action from Brussels or its neighbors .
the emergency situation in two southern regions on Tuesday gave authorities more powers to tackle the crisis , so that they could shut down roads and speed up asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country would also plan the construction of a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border to Romania , in order to stop the influ@@ x of migrants in the country - after having finished a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even j@@ ails were deployed in the race to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and into the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insist@@ ed that most of the emerging economic refugees , who are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly in conflict with other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence constructed by the government along the southern border to Serbia into a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares state emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porter in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very clearly : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , which is expected next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said authorities 45 people tried to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of off@@ ences of crimes according to the new laws .
authorities are able to repair the fence quickly .
on Tuesday morning , Hungarian civil servants also closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia following a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Ros@@ s@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to manipul@@ ate the data of people and press down a crowd to go there .
about 20 managed to get involved , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey hal@@ ved
former U.S. Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to maintain a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at the national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins over against her .
Clinton has now supported 47 percent of democratic voters in primary elections ( 58 percent before ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he candidate for the presidential office , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the pres@@ election .
more than five months before the beginning of the pres@@ election , most democratic voters say it &apos;s too early to say that their opinion is stuck to what candidates will support them .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders did some gains .
Clinton has a major lead in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished .
your support with the men has decreased significantly , and S@@ anders is only returned here with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic voters less than 50 years has fled , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
but Clinton has a big advantage over the older voters .
last month , Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit lead over the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a five @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters in the prim@@ aries state that they would support Clinton if it was nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are enthusiastic above all of her .
the views are more mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
while 48 percent of democratic voters in the pres@@ idency say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , is the most common answer that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman president is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s suppor@@ ter also men@@ tions her connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to dealing with the problems and the eligi@@ bility are also cited .
as the Vice President thro@@ ws a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic voters need to be asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head .
of Clin@@ tons &apos;s supporters , more than half say that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den does not decide to run for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s Vorsprung durch S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election ; however , this figure has dropped by 78 percent last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second at this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; selectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about their eligi@@ bility .
similar to last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate has emerged as unacceptable to these voters .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important features among voters of the pres@@ election of their party .
maj@@ orities ought to consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den best deals with hon@@ esty in the three candidates , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the leadership .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
democratic voters in primary elections generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and server remain as foreign minister during the term of office , most Democratic voters of the previous elections are satisfied with their statement of the matter and say that their opinions have not affected all in all .
but it is another story in the American public altogether .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only one third is satisfied .
the public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on their general opinion of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion was still wor@@ sen@@ ing .
they are mainly Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say their views of Clinton become worse .
although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters in total : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of those entitled to vote nationwide are also seeing Tru@@ mp as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tru@@ mp , however , receive good grades with guidance .
of the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut off with hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the pres@@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son advances in nationwide survey close to Donald Tru@@ mp
Ben Car@@ son is at the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times pol@@ l close to Donald Tru@@ mp
the two candidates are now half the support of voters in the new survey , and others lose a dramatic foo@@ thold
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tru@@ mp in large numbers throughout the country . support is growing at 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , 27 % in the Tuesday &apos;s survey .
but Car@@ son enjoyed the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also found that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and exceeds Tru@@ mp under republi@@ can elec@@ tors with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio governor John Ka@@ sich , is kno@@ cked down with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen the lowest , with 10 % support last month now 2 % .
former Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are in third place with 6 % .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey published last week shows that Car@@ son rises in surveys - with 19 % support from the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support .
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tru@@ mp significantly ahead of Car@@ son .
with a view to the Car@@ son rising last week , Tru@@ mp found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tru@@ mp@@ s &apos;s faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bath temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , one trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people no longer go into the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week , shares the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) .
in contrast , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the East it even reaches up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood are bur@@ dened with the death of a Bar@@ uch College new@@ bie
almost two years after a student died during a fatal ritual of a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges were filed against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood have brut@@ ally attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death .
officials said he had been loaded with connected eyes with a 30 pound ruck@@ sack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a goal .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
but they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , goo@@ gling his symptoms and contacting Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to seek advice , said Police Chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide utensils and basically set up the welfare of the Brotherhood about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; Police Chief Wagner said .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and the next morning he died of his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g has repeatedly been inflic@@ ted on the head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s with a bl@@ unt force .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student died in the ch@@ ic@@ anes every year , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer representing D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment on charges of murder of the third rank for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of har@@ ass@@ ment and formation of a criminal union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to take responsibility for the people involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or officially - sanc@@ tioned this , we will also account for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood has re@@ vo@@ iced its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a raise is coming , and the hous@@ et@@ op will get fu@@ cked up , yields for bonds will rise , and the economy will slip into recession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will last and how long it will last .
in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance on the course of the process .
a recession came within just 11 months following the initial interest rate increase and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , albeit not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems react .
hence , representatives of the US central bank stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather to the period needed for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could find that the whole excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated due to interest increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual revival of U.S. interest rates at normal elev@@ ations , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to be afraid .
this does not mean that there will be no effects .
here is a historical trend @-@ based view of how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency that net assets yield from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a newer study to what happens after the F@@ ed interest rate increases . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , in the past 35 years , the market is mostly up@@ trend - about 14 percent - on the road to interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days after ( average gain of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis published by Bob D@@ oll , chief executive strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares ten@@ se to occur later in the increase cycle and the return thus begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rate increases often promote it .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession .
it is extremely not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , 118 interest rate increases since 1950 only accounted for the nominal GDP of less than 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter , according to Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest rate in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raises the question of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether it is different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants all year round held an interest rate of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this meeting , fut@@ ures trading gives only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study all the up@@ lifting cycles of 1950 up to now have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and before rec@@ essions insured very quickly after the beginning of recovery in the shadows , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are 74 months so far .
fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates an increase in interest rates , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect in bonds is faster than on shares if they change their strategic direction .
in bonds the returns seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle takes place .
at the end of the mo@@ cking cycle , the bond tom@@ bs fall immediately , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will cause returns between longer and shorter loans closer together and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; highly galvan@@ ic bonds often yield better returns in such a climate , although &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are still careful to expect higher returns , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fix@@ ed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is interesting , Jones says , that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations , there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have increased , the yield curve has increased , lending has increased and volati@@ lity has increased - all the features of the market when the F@@ ed has sharpen@@ ed its strategy .
corporations , large and large , will benefit from taking advantage of the greater part of their business operations in the US if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational corporations with high debts are becoming po@@ orer because an increasing dollar is making their products more expensive in the global market and also financing their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively , three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts said in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded the average rate of 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares sur@@ passed their equi@@ val@@ ents with lower quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts are a major problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose the majority , said Gold@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; outside the pure share games consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
savers could see profits by higher returns , even if experts in different opinion are how fast this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Member of Parliament , Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament &apos;s conservative member critic@@ ised the station for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; du@@ mm@@ ung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ish@@ able from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also cited the BBC Music Awards and said that she only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked the program The Voice and said it was not very original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claims a leading MP and increases new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private sen@@ ders do not do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also cited the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under a different name .
so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples that you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC General Director rejected the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I &apos;m learning about Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn anywhere else about classical music .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works , I think is really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder is needed to engage the audience than it did in the past , because the British were less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production , which was under fire during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sports for the promotion of commercial ri@@ vals .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of € 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insist@@ ed that BBC 1 Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Richter - was produced &quot; in special BBC mode . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wants the company to find &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a hit from our own barn &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if it started a lot of entertainment next time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from other series of The Voice in the future or to issue money from the fee pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales rose at slow@@ est in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this .
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest score since the beginning of records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to buy
experts believe that Black Friday slow@@ ed down expenses in November
for over a decade the virtual shopping has bo@@ asted and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost cities .
however , experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers only showed seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , this has evolved over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , Editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index of the Guardian .
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do so in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this comm@@ utes itself , and we may experience that growth dimin@@ ishes .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , imported from America , is cited as a reason for the declining sales .
experts believe that buyers will with@@ hold their purchases prior to this event , which will take place on the last Friday of November .
last year five times the average number of buyers gathered around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , in which buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could stop shop@@ pers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found that £ 5 was issued a little more than £ 1 online .
with some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims bury the killed in Mek@@ ka during the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the dead bodies of 29 dead are carried by the streets by Muslims in the first burial in Mec@@ ca
Saudi Arabia is putting down the collapse of some of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that in addition , a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered together when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mos@@ que .
mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the way to pay their respect when the first of the dead came their last journey to the Al @-@ Mo@@ ved Gra@@ vey@@ ard .
the procession passed on to the holy site , where only days before a building crane collap@@ sed through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on those who were praying .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral when the Saudi king left a sanc@@ tion over the construction company of Bin Laden &apos;s family for the disaster that also left 3@@ 94 injured .
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 people who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed through the Great Central Bank of Mec@@ ca were carried by the streets .
among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage , assisted the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents at the beginning of the annual h@@ add@@ ling at the Grand Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ an to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to become the city will continue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; king Sal@@ man said today , the Bin Laden Group would not have stopped the arm of the crane when it was not used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an Arabic version of the decree released by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the leadership of the company abroad would be banned .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man began to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which rus@@ hed into an inner courtyard of the Grand mos@@ que , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered before the H@@ add@@ an , which is taking place later this month .
the Bin Laden Group did not publish any statements about the breakdown of the crane and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also t@@ apped the group because of non @-@ current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes are surrounded by Mek@@ ka &apos;s large mos@@ que as part of the massive construction project managed by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been involved in Saudi Arabia &apos;s ruling family for decades and is taking over major construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a dis@@ sident son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the fall of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of any healthy Muslims .
officials said that 158 people remain in hospital .
government officials ordered 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to be paid to the members of the killed and the same amount of permanent injured .
other wounded will receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European tra@@ des@@ men is over
British concern increasingly arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe has increased
this means that 200 additional scre@@ wing shops , aimed at craftsmen , are opened .
at the same time King@@ fis@@ her will close 60 B &amp; Q outlets nationwide
by Rupert St@@ einer , City Chief Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that the British lay down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European tra@@ des@@ men who carry out the work in their homes .
if you can deal with a hammer or a brush for painting walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays .
the British increasingly employ arti@@ sans to carry out DIY jobs in their homes , such as the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the building markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe that offer services at low prices is now out@@ dated .
thus , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 other scre@@ wing shops that are aimed at professionals and close 60 sales offices of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions are made by women .
at the moment , the men were weighing the men .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households that have more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need to shift this more strongly towards a balance .
in principle , half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , one of the only five women listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ fis@@ her is almost the only company that staff@@ ed 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and CFO .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ fis@@ her reported a decline in the half @-@ year &apos;s profit and sales after the group was paying the cost of closing the shops .
due to the trend , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
at the Landes@@ gericht K@@ lagen@@ furt , two function@@ aries of the Austrian Volleyball @-@ Viz@@ em@@ eist@@ ers A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and abor@@ tion .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of office .
from this alleg@@ ation , he was acqu@@ itted legally in May .
the current trial was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the Prosecutor &apos;s Prosecutor , Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary examination , the accused decided that in the years 2006 to 2011 the defend@@ ants had funds from club accounts on which they were allowed to disp@@ oni@@ ze in their functions for private purposes .
he estimated the damage with around 400@@ ,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sports officials are also accused of financial off@@ ences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fact expi@@ red the Chair@@ person of the Spo@@ on@@ bill , Jud@@ ge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
for the rejection of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the Defence argued that at no time an asset was created by the association .
the sports function@@ aries would have charged only expense allowance and the sports club , for whom they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in whom they invested a lot of time and money out of the debt - the Pas@@ si@@ va amounted to approximately 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then we stood before the situation : do we keep the club further or lock it up ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the defend@@ ants , a bread@@ winner of the chief financial audi@@ tor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his colleague and co @-@ defend@@ ant , he then decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money to put our life insurance as safety at the bench , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been agreed with the association : you can freely manage the money , it is only allowed to make no debts .
furthermore - in the case of a corresponding financial success , the payment of the allowance compens@@ ations has been decided retro@@ actively until 1991 .
therefore , one part of the expense allowance had been paid only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when an asset had been on the account .
therefore l@@ ump @-@ formwork and not detailed contracts appeared , the former ob@@ s@@ man explained the events .
the accounts and savings accounts managed the two defend@@ ants together , said the second accused .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why the out@@ flow of the association was not disclosed in detail , the judge asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association did not care in detail for financial security , it was important to only have the freedom of debt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when in 2011 against the one function@@ ary of function@@ ary investigations for office abuse began , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the club account .
these were back@@ rests , decl@@ aring the accused .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; account ran on the name of the second defend@@ ant and was not known according to his statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know for a long time .
then he finally said he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything of that money , put the prosec@@ utor in the room .
the co @-@ defend@@ ant was informed , Jus@@ tified the function@@ ary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damage claim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why compensation ? , wanted to know judge and prosec@@ utor .
the first defend@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association never had any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what shall I do when the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With this you are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he never purchased a c@@ ents salary , he only calcul@@ ates mil@@ eage and di@@ ets .
he charged EUR 1,000 per month to the club , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
the defend@@ ants were not able to present exact documents for the early years .
these were no longer kept up after an audit , in which everything was considered correct , they explained .
the second defend@@ ant was also related to the mil@@ eage .
all the deport@@ ations were made in cash , with which he had to go to the Bank to Blei@@ burg from his home town , he stated in his statement .
the main hearing will be continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard stri@@ ves another 30.000 jobs
in addition to staff reductions , which have been running for three years , the computer terri@@ ese will reduce further jobs when spl@@ itting the company .
the sub@@ missions at the American Compu@@ gi@@ ants Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not end .
within the scope of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the mining of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment .
as a result , costs tot@@ alling 2.7 billion dollars ( 2.4 billion euros ) should be saved on Tuesday .
the move will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall from the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 5@@ 5.000 jobs that has been running for three years has not yet been completed .
at the end of the 2013 / 14 fiscal year , HP employed around 30@@ 2,000 employees .
the Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ share has declined by 2.3 percent .
the company , which has grown up with printers from California &apos;s Pal@@ o Alto , is currently emerging : in this way , the computer and print business is to be bund@@ led even further in a new society - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services .
both business segments are to be listed on the stock exchange .
once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand for corporate customers in accordance with its services , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer moved to Lenovo .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
thus revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responds with spl@@ itting and massive sub@@ missions for change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has re@@ acted very late to the fact that customers increasingly buy smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and do more and more business online .
Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age the reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
however , a direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would overwhel@@ m@@ ingly reject : 54 per cent spoke against it , 35 percent were agre@@ eing .
it is 61 percent positive that other countries fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria .
24 percent are opposed to intervene in the conflict .
in collaboration with the Syrian leader , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 51 per cent of those questioned would be 20 percent .
29 percent could not decide .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : erup@@ tion of violence on Serbian @-@ Hungarian fron@@ tier
the Hungarian police fought against several hundred refugees on the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke tear gas and water @-@ thro@@ wer .
Euron@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the breach of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees passed through the border .
behind that , a police line had formed and behind the polic@@ emen was a water @-@ thro@@ wer ready .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials were initially replacing the Pfe@@ ffer@@ spray .
then the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now withdrawn something . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
children who had breath@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees stuck together and suffered under the breath of breath .
the press spokes@@ men of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US bank@@ note bank
the world is watching when the U.S. staff arrives two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time for almost a decade the interest is raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , the last week of the view that the F@@ ed would do this , now thinks the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates at the current level will be from 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ isation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , Head of staff at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and only generate low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less crude view of global conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she warned the markets to adapt to an up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment , but the signs indicate that the odds against such a step are good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision should be announced at 8 : 00 PM CE@@ T on Thursday
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death ri@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Delta State University left excuse writing &quot; &quot; &quot;
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues later on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; in the first murder and wanted , &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , professor for ge@@ ography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He has shot on someone and killed one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb said to the staff of the emergency call centre that the police must send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cute dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police demanded the c@@ aller by his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 that said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted I could undo it .
I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman I ever loved . &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb pulled 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed Eth@@ ane Schmidt , a professor of history , before finally taking his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s imagination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday that Lamb supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ l had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that they were married for about seven years , as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good man &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but stayed friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was their daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog called Light@@ ning , met Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that Lamb had called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He is not going to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen picked him up on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville on that night , Lamb pulled his car to the side , fled by foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb received a Ph@@ .@@ D. in spring 2015 from Delta State University , as his lifestyle on the university &apos;s website .

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group around
Lufthansa is planning a large group remo@@ del@@ ing .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros in the year alone with a better organization .
150 of the roughly 1,000 managers around the world will cost the company restructuring to the workplace .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , with the pilot union there are new negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and enhances Euro@@ wings design .
the aim of the real@@ ignment was to contribute to a contribution of some EUR 500 million a year resulting from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday .
among other things , there is no longer a member of the Executive Board for the passenger &apos;s business in future .
the Euro@@ wings low @-@ cost airline should be developed as stand@@ alone as possible .
the managing team headed by Chef Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r will be responsible for the future of Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt for Euro@@ wings .
with the launch , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
so far , the organization of the 120@@ ,000 associates was complex .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United cannot play for months because of double frac@@ tures
Luke Sha@@ w suffered from Manchester at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
while this brought the left outside defender to the weeping and excluded him from playing for at least six months , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute following the 20 year old Sha@@ w in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being brought to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a dual foot frac@@ ture and lies in the hospital . &quot;
he will be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 , who has a hard time and then plays fantastic , and then that happens .
he had an oxygen mask in the dressing room .
he cried .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , it will take six months and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno was happy to be able to escape from a red map and the hanging of an El@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola R@@ iz@@ z@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , did not punish the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian arbitr@@ ator had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself when I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a tweet to Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
related to this : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w during the defeat at PS@@ V
with the European Championship in France , the UK distributor has an additional incentive to recover until the coming of June .
Phil@@ lip Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this type of injury , everyone is very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an enemy .
Mor@@ eno has suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it is a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball moving in a different direction , so it looked like he &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very ill with it . I &apos;m sorry .

surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long before you know it by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the environmental f@@ abel published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron wrote in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read about my children , as it always seems to be an image or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is pur@@ ported to describe the plot of the book , instead gives a content of the 2012 movie version that added new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ in @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the girl of his dreams by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree , &quot; one reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel was listening and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so familiar with the plot of the book . here , an unknown boy hears how the local environment is rav@@ aged by the gre@@ edy , tree @-@ prone , th@@ need stri@@ ck@@ ling once @-@ ler , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; rav@@ aged .
most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said the text probably had come from Cameron &apos;s electoral cir@@ cus .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text of Cameron &apos;s staff was delivered , but there were no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion of England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult
to meet Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when one sees the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
I would not exclude an out@@ ward victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page is possibly less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the batch list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali is developing as a spin @-@ punch and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown quantity at test level , is an option for the attack .
this news @-@ based news : Adam Ly@@ th comes out of the England test ca@@ ster and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to release Adam Ly@@ th , of course , is hard to analyse for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
during its seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are targeted on results .
there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best sel@@ ections .
long ago I would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own destiny .
hopefully there will be another chance for Yor@@ k@@ shire to come out .
the Great Britain trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude , even though he did not get such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is especially a team man .
the question of how much time a test man gets to set his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick was ninth .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play back and forth .
the only accus@@ ation that could be raised was that England initially set up Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales is coming in , and he is a hit man , whom I greatly benefit from .
he is an X @-@ factor Cri@@ cket player , which we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which hit us very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea to suggest Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin Bow@@ ler and get four squ@@ e@@ cks , turned up and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s player of cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een might not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is he number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my former colleague Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he started as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred pensions immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes to the ca@@ tho@@ lic as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he was very impressed as a young man .
people may see his statistics - average 31 with the ra@@ cket and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no large number of backup spins that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some wise additions to the Train@@ erst@@ ab .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ den , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game that will bring a wealth of experiences , as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful commitment to the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela , he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes , new voices can bring fresh breeze in the changing cub@@ icle , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before .
Coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break to Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule .
and you have to remember that as with players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit from the UK from the EU ) could attract additional allow@@ ances if the economy falls into a sl@@ um until 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ gor@@ g@@ ated ren@@ ego@@ ti@@ ation strategy to hold Great Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble with every day , even without the choice of the ingeni@@ ous Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , pushing hard for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at &apos;s friend recently said that some member states are so deeply mired in various crises , as the EU is now and not always out of their own guilt , Britain itself created agenda with split conc@@ essions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes that they usually do not want to be satisfied .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they end@@ anger the social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Minister of Finance climb to summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend who wishes an outside Great Britain inside the EU @-@ tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets us see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter if we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s carefully @-@ minded Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as has happened with the exagger@@ ated long @-@ outs like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mitter@@ rand ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
it is also a verbal force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right @-@ wing government , Spain a lef@@ tist .
it is difficult to imagine that they will break down a leg to help the sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ British whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they do not want because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may even intentionally plan some useful notes , quite in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s reference campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process susp@@ ects my boy@@ friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ ego@@ ti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won nothing from the ren@@ ego@@ ti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their cost and what EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press @-@ tone , as it did during the 1975 referendum , inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entry 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
you may remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opportun@@ ist , who has made a name for himself as an &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s .
with all his mad@@ dening , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ins , phone @-@ h@@ opping foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ nation@@ als , most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about it , but found that if you sit in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , better ban@@ anas are distributed to distra@@ ct him instead of having lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had the principle of the non @-@ adopted Constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a back@@ door to him .
the press has never denied it .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly flap on the back in Westminster on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me anymore - seems at risk to repeat N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks Bo@@ y@@ boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch strategy of the 80 &apos;s , a mistake back then and today .
it may take but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe is - I express it in a friendly way - in the development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps &apos;s traditional blu@@ ff @-@ off tendency and wild followers of Tor@@ ey Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ev@@ ism can say yes to everyone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ein Ben@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but no B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week said that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the pro@@ voc@@ ative John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell as a shadow Chancellor was a bad idea . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be il@@ lo@@ y@@ ally loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; stay under all circumstances &quot; - B@@ enn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday evening .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - keep in mind that he even touched me - News discipline is important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it &apos;s right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the speech campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks like that .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities about EU membership - in line with its B@@ enn@@ ite Bel@@ ager@@ ungs @-@ economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left @-@ wing dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic dis@@ agreements .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to NATO - Tom Wat@@ son is firm convinced that J@@ C does not launch a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital ? - they also have di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if all this can be sen@@ sel@@ ess ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded of at the start on Monday of something that was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critici@@ ze Public Health UK report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims from a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) Lanc@@ et joined by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
P@@ he published the &quot; Basic Reports &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extremely win@@ dy basis &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the proof of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that &quot; the present best estimate is that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 persons who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products into a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director previously had received British American Tob@@ acco Medium ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also under@@ took BA@@ T references to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting stated to receive funding from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the funding that he should have received according to reports from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International , they added .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the committee are not delivered , but there are several famous e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also provide an industry financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
at the meeting also the tobacco line of the P@@ he took part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relates &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products with most criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he Report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes served as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that he had already responded to the alleg@@ ations of BM@@ J .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies at his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative dangers in comparison to tobacco .
almost 8@@ 0,000 people die annually on a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
through the clear presentation of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ erin , says former boss of Channel 4
the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ erin and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not broadcast by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
he critici@@ zed the BBC for being public @-@ law programs likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ disputed time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers like BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC General Director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success to get in touch with the BBC .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also clearly be shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus Communications Committee as part of his investigation on the BBC &apos;s future .
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , which I don &apos;t consider in the medium or long term for a good idea , one should at least put his production on programs that others do not make or commissioned .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve the wid@@ est possible support for their future .
the idea that otherwise nobody would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s non@@ sense of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ erin is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I endeav@@ our to see how this is supposed to be public television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC ever .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC show what former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows like East@@ ern@@ ers should sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ law niche programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they fulfil their tasks , and they can argue if they go to their apparent missions to justify 4 billion pounds of broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the radio fee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , you all think , we all think that you get a great value here for £ 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for the £ 150 , ask me if this is true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also testified before the Committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should review its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ thi@@ an Mission &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to educ@@ ate , form and maintain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that only little of BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it would be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example in &quot; inform@@ ing , explaining and talking about the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada . &quot;
to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television is shown , and with the commercial transm@@ it@@ ters to enter alliances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ Sizegenetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment when they reson@@ ate with sound impulses which have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard .
the impulses work by inser@@ ting mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels , which respond to ultr@@ asonic waves .
more on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ Sizegenetics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electric impulses to the brain of people for the treatment of symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms do not usually respond to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultr@@ asonic waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultr@@ asonic waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the worms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P 4 ion channels .
when applying ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ ves@@ icles and transferred to worms , where they turn on the changed mo@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Hal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ GP could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light which has to be sent to the desired place in the brain , low frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily disable the targeted human neur@@ ons for the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Hal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

many artists participate in protest movements within protest movements and realize that they have to move outside into the real world , so that their art has an impact on society .

the Am@@ nesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , which works non @-@ profit with the graphic artist and vo@@ ic@@ eover artist , who also works for free .
&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP &apos;s creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around advertising for the Ce@@ L calendar - and thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic z@@ wi@@ el@@ ich@@ y corporate advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it remains more vibrant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the blu@@ ff with bright colors and animation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

what we need now is a progression of the British government and the guarantee that torture instruments are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally at our door@@ step .
perhaps the most creative art around the arms trade fair comes from the area within Ex@@ Ce@@ L , where exhibitors bo@@ ther fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for living in student residen@@ ces
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ for@@ get@@ ter , I moved into a student residence , still in the faith of Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those who I have anno@@ yed - and the numerous , long @-@ lasting complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be di@@ sti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entry into student residen@@ ces ranges from slightly nervous to absolute sc@@ ary .
it is temp@@ ting to tie : people tell where you get , if and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ leap , where you stand in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &apos;re honest Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in serious , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those you would not talk to even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be .
let people leave .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks reception , film @-@ night event locations and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people attract and pay their under@@ wear .
related to this : do not remember to start a relationship at the university
intro@@ ver@@ ted receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a room @-@ to @-@ room bum@@ ble@@ bee @-@ culture , which is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get the energy that I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos anch@@ oring : do it .
a guy in my residence halls had the idea that a locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
close friendship through baking .
since you start the university at the height of the back @-@ man@@ ia , it is kno@@ cking at the doors of people to introduce themselves to a plate of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than greeting the 1950 &apos;s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have baked something . so , and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain themselves and will end up perhaps associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course this depends on whether you are a decent aker .
badly mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat cause people to lie dor@@ man@@ t when they kno@@ ck .
to steal food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
of course , the ho@@ of of chicken is a theft , but is it the taking of a drop milk for your tea too ?
check this with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say to serve themselves , even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal more balanced than my room@@ mate , who added a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people away from sleep or from work .
it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people who sit in the glass house in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb .
a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbors whether they make up something , Drum &amp; bass somewhat qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even loud music .
when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly left her neighbours to sleep for two hours before she left her own music , shut down her door and went to her three hour trial .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would acci@@ dentally enter the same residence hall ?
conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be very embarrass@@ ing when you hold a room@@ mate for your future spouse , take care of them , dis@@ connect and see them every day , and perhaps witness how they draw all together friends together ?
of course , the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk a little reason to your abdom@@ en .
in the exciting moment in which you notice that someone has left his keys in his not locked room , the boundary between an el@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good stre@@ ak is funny , but it takes only moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
place by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety - but never ch@@ ew someone &apos;s room with too@@ th@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door , and place your keys in a glass of water , which will put you in the freezer - but do not stap@@ le your bel@@ ong@@ ings at the ceiling any more than twice .
town@@ houses for Refu@@ ge@@ es , Single @-@ Stud@@ ents , Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ nis@@ er
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner construc@@ ts terra@@ ced houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for instance for refugees , but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need a living room but also the only educ@@ ative mother and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ dien@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build good and well today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will be pushing for the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Guil@@ dner believes to know how quickly the living space can be created : he builds town@@ houses for refugees in a project .
Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market .
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people remain here for a great deal .
in view of the refugee flow , we also need sufficient living space in the coming decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a row house needs the least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if one puts people in blocks of dwell@@ ings .
each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three residential units for four asylum seek@@ ers each .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge .
it can be that many refugees say it is peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be easily converted into the respective needs .
what are the costs ?
Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 Euro , without land .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
are building regulations conf@@ using their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : construction law I carried out my project correctly .
it always makes the im@@ pending D@@ amo@@ cles &quot; worth special construction and the Pit@@ ch Ord@@ in@@ ance .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
it is still being hired , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities there is enough space .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
guil@@ d : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
which is definitely not true .
but do you not ag@@ grav@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable apartments ?
Gil@@ dner : true is : we had a building boom in Germany over the past five years , but we have built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even ordinary people need living space .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setup app , typing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then selecting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after installation , because they get an error message that tells the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update failed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to circum@@ vent the problem , users are advised to either wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght is back or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean clearing apps to create space - but Apple has made it more impro@@ b@@ able by stream@@ lining the updates . similarly , it will be easier to do so by deplo@@ ying a special tool to delete apps and then re @-@ install them once the process is complete .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued , as the phone may switch on half way and that could lead to break@@ age of the update .

you should also make sure that you have seen our check@@ list of all things in front of your download to prevent things going wrong and protect themselves if they do it . iOS 9 brings new features , including a much smar@@ ter personal assistant and enormous new productivity features for the iPad , as well as changes that accelerate and repair the operating system .
Ros@@ berg &apos;s only motto : full attack
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows in the fight for the championship title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes @-@ team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton just one motto : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full attack &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
the chess club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; ( Chess Friends Bad Kis@@ singen ) , which was founded three months ago , has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players .
the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player , who lasted more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the bearer of the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz 1 . class and honorary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ kam@@ p and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation received by Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot raise the membership fee .
youth work and talent search are also to be promoted .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of his connec@@ t@@ edness with the spa town .
district office looking for direct contact
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Sal@@ u@@ dis and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alten@@ markt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined the social foundation &apos;s man@@ tle and opened a new stop at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
apart from consultations you can also participate in courses there .
the social foundation draws it down from the mountain to the city centre .
to be more precise , to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square .
a new district office was recently opened there .
here , directly next to the shopping market , citizens from now on receive information on questions such as care insurance or services of hospitals and nursing staff .
for years we have established our out@@ patient care service that often nour@@ ishing relatives are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too often , many services of the insurance companies are not used because the complexity of insurance companies is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new land@@ lady Jutta W@@ eig@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the Bürger@@ sp@@ ital as well as for the ambul@@ atory service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
apart from the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this purpose the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , additional offers such as fall prevention , memory training or a physi@@ o@@ therapeutic treatment can be used .
the offers of the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other perfectly .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , cancer and rehabilitation .
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , managing director of Sal@@ u@@ dis .
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre shows both business leaders in particular demographic change .
because this makes a good de@@ centralized infrastructure essential in the individual districts of Bamberg in the future .
in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the opening ceremony , the district office also dedicated itself to the harmon@@ isation of old age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite you to a regular soci@@ able gather@@ ings . &quot;
this makes the social foundation a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independent and well in their familiar environment as possible .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 12 a.@@ m .

it is something special for our team to play against a third @-@ party .

Wiener architect Karl M@@ ang 92 @-@ years passed away
Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Vienna &apos;s architecture , is dead .
he died on September 5 at the age of 92 , as the Künstler@@ haus announced on Tuesday .

penalty : Tim Wiese raises polic@@ ew@@ oman with money
ex @-@ foot@@ b@@ aller Tim Wiese was attacked in Bremen .
foot@@ b@@ aller was once , now Tim Wiese , former Nation@@ alt@@ or@@ hü@@ ter in Germany and near Bremen and H@@ offen@@ heim was engaged , W@@ rest@@ ler .
according to his own statement , he wants to have 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years .
intellec@@ tually , however , he has not appe@@ aled against it .
Wiese had just cut the hair in Bremen &apos;s inner city when he saw a parking space guar@@ dian standing out a leaf@@ let for his white Chev@@ ro@@ let Cam@@ aro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a meadow burst out of the business , insul@@ ted the bureaucr@@ at and threw her the counter@@ fei@@ ting fine from his feet as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper reports . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the city of Bremen the accus@@ ations are confirmed , but the consequences for the unusual incident are not yet clari@@ fied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it from the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only then will I decide whether a meadow will be displayed or not .

men tested on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses searched for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 hrs , three young men were on the way from Bad So@@ den to Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
according to the police , one from the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at this point the group was at the height of the b@@ ft petrol station .
there were also three persons on the premises of the gas station .
one of these men now scre@@ amed the young and hit him with his fist .
the victim suffered a nas@@ al her@@ nia and ble@@ ed strongly out of the nose .
when his two friends hur@@ ried and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first left his victim .
the wounded young man was brought home by his friends .
the perpetr@@ ator pursued the group with a passenger car up to their home and drove it demonstr@@ atively several times .
when the car was not seen any more , the injured went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
with the aid of a stroke , one spra@@ yed on the face and the th@@ ig@@ h of the victim .
the injured had to be taken to a hospital for medical care .
so far only a vag@@ ue day description is available .
one of the men was about 1.@@ 80 meters tall .
the second bat should have been around 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police ask witnesses and instructions to report on the phone number 0@@ 6@@ 181 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice Fel@@ ste@@ ausen and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen .
also the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ f mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased .
in many places in the country there are missing doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , is lucky : there , Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice field breaks on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich succ@@ eeds in the coming months with half a passage .
after a reconstruction phase , Müller re@@ opened the practice on 12 October , until then he invested 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight , when the Fel@@ steh@@ aus acquired Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ rat@@ l , who currently completed their specialist training in the Ver@@ den Hospital and wants to get into practice in the coming year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the mill@@ ers would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was ready I just called them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea to practice their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage he also see his own boss soon .
and so they agreed that the rub@@ b@@ ish bought the house with the practice .
meanwhile they will continue to dwell in frac@@ tured hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller grew up , his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen and in 2009 he was appointed Chief Physi@@ cian in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz and volunte@@ ered in the DR@@ K @-@ prepar@@ edness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
as of September 19 , the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
while the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ er works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) has specialised in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the mill@@ ers , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle themselves as a general practitioner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the end@@ os@@ copy is coming out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ ig@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the remo@@ del@@ ing , the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and load EC@@ Gs and need a talk room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
as part of a subsi@@ dy programme , a total supplement of 50,000 euros from the administrative district ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and glad we are that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ rat@@ l , approximately 2000 patients come to the field of field breaks every quarter , in the average German average practice there are approximately 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another doctor &apos;s practice .
a positive side @-@ effect of the practical tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf , according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ ausen .
if no successor has been found , she would have gone .
who visits Müll@@ ers Langu@@ es , also still looks in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the Fel@@ steh@@ aus .
with their departure , an era ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf , after all , the doctors have practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ er reminis@@ ces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a little melanch@@ oly can already be felt after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will certainly see many patients , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the inter@@ nis@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband laugh@@ ingly compl@@ ements : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , I &apos;ve always pushed myself in front of gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and loves to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we leave the refugees &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also raised on our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain upright .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still , it is clear that anyone who wants to ask for asylum will also be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people is in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border .
it takes a controlled course .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would also leave incoming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and under certain circumstances establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
this is how the Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar did not see Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the supervision of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the boundary of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia does not want to abri@@ dge its borders for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fulfil its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours on Tuesday to pass the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in eastern Croatia to avoid registration .
the Croatian police could pick them up in the nearby fields of corn .
according to local media , police vehicles constantly meet with new refugees in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is mainly about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country reck@@ ons with around 4000 refugees , said Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Ser@@ b border , which until now had brought migrants to the Hungarian border , would diver@@ t Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Belgrade government denied that it was it that people instruc@@ t certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to media reports , in the morning a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id in the morning , further buses would be expected in the course of the day .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the passengers were on the road all the night away from the Macedonia border which was around 500 kilometres away by Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary did , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this could in fact lead to a slightly further west @-@ oriented route for ob@@ servers of the previous Balkan route from Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive limits on border control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister , Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic , had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not refer to details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strict controls are carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been an integral part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently witnessed a good testimony to the country as far as the standard of border controls is concerned .
on the Serbian side there are still about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked .
whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm Wednesday morning with a local evi@@ denti@@ ary in Hor@@ gos : he considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there would not be very high refugee figures at this time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey across Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise immigrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute maps indicating alternative routes through Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .
stock exchanges : Ukra@@ inians are paying 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok should have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals , which has been accused of having gained an insight into un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites like Business Wire , Market@@ ers and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
in@@ sider trading must have been made on the financial markets with the captured information .
in this way , a total of more than 100 million dollars were launched to the investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders will ultimately be captured , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the SE@@ C communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trials against 32 further accused continued in the case .
most of the defend@@ ants come from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators are said to have acted in both the US and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce care Mannheim exists for 20 years
there is a busy operation around the Mannheim site .
people do their worries , sometimes fast pac@@ ing , sometimes cozy bum@@ bling .
they control the two stations of the Mannheim car park at Par@@ ade@@ platz .
city railways keep .
&quot; &quot; &quot; puls@@ ating , pr@@ uri@@ ous life with glorious autumn sun light and in the midst of four large boards each with the head@@ line &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Before I die I want to die .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this action the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce care attracted attention to its 20th anniversary and is quite confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went through the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce care is also available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and talks like the volunteers .
while a passport spontaneously falls to the chal@@ k and affir@@ ms the proposition about &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; continue with the camper through the USA , &quot; &quot; stop war &quot; or &quot; don &apos;t suffer for a long time , &quot; others remain short , read , say pro@@ positions like &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and then go on .
over and over again , on the ver@@ ge of small discussions about the action itself , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on the spot .
&quot; only when I realise that at some point the end of this world comes to me , I can live ir@@ responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ on@@ ist work Mannheim , which is working together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ Association to support the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce .
therefore , this public@@ ity @-@ effective action for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good .
the fact that not everyone wants to publicly disclose to the boards , however , is understandable , la@@ stly , it is a very personal matter .
the subject of death and death is still afflicted with tab@@ oos , such as the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed greatly to the opening of people .
an estim@@ ation that An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid shares .
the death and mour@@ ning accompan@@ ist is one of the volunteer staff of the first hour .
confronted by personal experiences with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in eu@@ than@@ asia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hos@@ pi@@ ce &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was seeking honorary officials , she immediately reported to her and was part of the founding in 1995 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Go@@ def@@ roid is part of a team of 45 honorary doc@@ tor@@ ates - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in Hos@@ pi@@ z Saint Vincent .
they are all trained carefully .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid can handle her tasks and experiences and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another warning , consider it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of the out@@ patient ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and non @-@ con@@ fession@@ al .
the financial support of health insurance funds and donations of relatives and associations allows the training and training and supervis@@ ing of the mort@@ ality and ob@@ itu@@ aries .
training for new employees is offered every two years .

F@@ ed@@ Ex results mixed , financial prospects for 2016 reduced
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supplier gi@@ ga@@ des lowered his prospects for a whole year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for their holidays .
at that time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell by 2.5 percent in pre@@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. An@@ no@@ unces to earn a gain of 10.@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in the fiscal year , ending in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast .
analysts expect a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
despite the price increases , the lower outlook is 4.@@ 9 percent average and effective on January 4th and despite higher traction for bo@@ d@@ ging of heavy and large packages , which will be lifted from November onwards .
the company said it nonetheless expects the result to increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and due to growth in online trading .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company would yield &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid earnings if one considers the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , which plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional labour , roughly the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just below the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , which predicted the twelve analysts questioned by Z@@ acks Investment Research .
sales rose 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of Z@@ acks sur@@ vey@@ ed analysts expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping over the past few years , which generated sales in its unit Express delivery to stagn@@ ation .
but the boom in online shopping improved the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , bo@@ d@@ ging sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices , while the result was lower due to higher labour costs in the freight business .
in pre@@ market trading , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by $ 3.@@ 85 , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0,@@ 15 .
on Tuesday they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
at its most expected meeting in the year , Federal Reserve Strate@@ gies spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide if it is time to raise the benchmark for the first time for almost a decade .
threatening them at one end of the adorned , two @-@ storey sitting hall , there is a m@@ ural of the United States .
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed chair@@ person Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues shall set the economic interests of the nation in front of all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold mission from Congress to keep up the maximum of US employment and prices here .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from unprecedented incentives by the near @-@ zero interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data on the economy show that it is growing soli@@ dly , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives fear@@ ful to strengthen this volati@@ lity by raising interest for federal bonds - and whether it is only a quarter of a percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they are seeing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; she said .
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which sec@@ ures itself the financial market .
about half of econom@@ ists who recently were inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an interest rate this week .
the financial markets , however , expect F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator that only shows a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the set , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts allevi@@ ate the blow by promising that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value jump@@ ed by 21.@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy sustain@@ s the set this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that time , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they do not panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a raise interest would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
just a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that , in spite of the complaints of liber@@ als , she had expected more economic progress to increase the sentence .
although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and close to the level the F@@ ed looks like full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , Chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world came together at the end of the month after China had de@@ valu@@ ated its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage Requi@@ rement fell below its peak in May by more than 16 % , as investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would th@@ rot@@ tle global growth .
the market has recovered slightly this month , and the Dow is now about 10 % below May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ence affects the complex calculation of when to increase the interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if events on the financial markets and news on the weakness of Chinese economy had not appeared in the last few weeks , they would tigh@@ ten the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff member of the US central bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least a month to get the effects better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about the impact on the U.S. economy and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the world economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be involved technically in its decision @-@ making process .
but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the mere suggestion of the leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; close &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her monetary expansion triggered confusion around the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can expect that they not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also rely on other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for the asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ ier , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that apparently are not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
varnis@@ er , a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who advoc@@ ates interest in interest , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its benchmark interest by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite a limited noticeable impact on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives cancelled the cuts .
the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market collapse , said Adam S. P@@ osen , a former member of the Bank of England &apos;s Bank of England .
the recent tur@@ mo@@ il is not close to that level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest because markets are rising , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until it is changed I don &apos;t think it should rush ahead of time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : emergency relief for refugees
more and more refugees come to Germany these days .
a warm welcome is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still loves to teach with her 74 L@@ enzen .
every Thursday she does it at the asylum seek@@ er at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
there they help refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , this is quite another lesson than at a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric Rio Grande supports nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS tries to inform women in a shock@@ ing way how important good nutrition during breast@@ feeding is . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who are su@@ cking to breasts that are painted with depic@@ tions of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research results suggest that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary modification that mothers should do .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet affects pregnant women actually the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der sports hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried appro@@ v@@ ingly approved the building application for the € 2.3 million sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof should become fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited turn of the gymn@@ as@@ tics on the Bern@@ ese sports grounds progres@@ sed step by step : in the recent municipal meeting , the revised construction application was unanim@@ ously approved without great discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; previously , the committee had also approved a proposal for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; resp@@ ectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion from the valid plan of construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be built with a non @-@ central first and roof over@@ hang &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; background of the planning is the planned use of the roof@@ ing surface for solar plants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way we get a wonderfully large south @-@ roof together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it was again about the roof inclin@@ ation required for energy reasons - unlike in the development plan - below 10 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan for roof inclin@@ ation does not allow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; whereby the Bern@@ ese municipal council generally de@@ parts restric@@ tively in case of liber@@ ating orders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is not a recurring project when it comes to gymn@@ as@@ tics : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gymn@@ asi@@ um building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros have been calculated at the expense .
subsidies are expected from school and l@@ atitude .
in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 metre hall will be presented to the Board of Agriculture for testing .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg should be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is the new Medical Director at the hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , the coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß asser@@ ted .
however , a decision will meet the Supervisory Board , and the meeting will be conven@@ ed on Wednesday , September 23 .
if the plans were to be implemented , all of the 50 staff at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg would continue to be employed .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with fishermen and the further @-@ existing inner station .
the rooms are available .
the employees who cannot come to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the employees were informed about the plans .
the change has spark@@ ed the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been a medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ au clinic since the beginning of the year and now changes to a private practice in close proximity of the hospital .
according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer , &quot; the name &quot; Fis@@ her &quot; came into play , who agreed to take over the leadership from 1 October and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this was in any case a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the range in the area &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialised in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
for the next two years , fisher@@ man and his team should , if the Supervisory Board agrees to agree both houses , until next year the former hospital of the pop@@ lar , which still has 35 beds , is to be defini@@ tively closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the administrative district had planned it for 2018 if the current refur@@ bish@@ ment was completed at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital .
the coun@@ c@@ ill@@ ors J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also the chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the German Stock Corporation , is to be used as accommodation for asylum @-@ seek@@ ers in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say that there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently , a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a daily psychiat@@ ry are housed there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fischer about the quasi @-@ move to the Le@@ ch , which has been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as chief physician for more than 30 years has not been given .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was repeatedly threatened with closure in the past few decades , departments were closed , for example the surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .
today the Hand@@ book of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions is required at the Berg@@ ischen HC tonight ( 8.@@ 15 pm ) .
the stand@@ ings of the Bundes@@ liga in Wuppertal is a clear favourite , but there is no reason for arro@@ gan@@ ce .
in the past season , the Bad@@ ener reloc@@ ated a painful defeat at Bh@@ c and got something good there .
hunting accident with two injuries at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their ma@@ ize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) , several h@@ unters were in use , as the police shared .
after a shot of shot , a man of 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was unclear .
the police estimate .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ olds from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violence crimes
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ p@@ se of 16 @-@ year @-@ olds from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
in the inter@@ rog@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and their cor@@ p@@ ses were thrown into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old , missing from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , has fallen victim to violence .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police hur@@ ried on Wednesday .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old recorded on Tuesday evening also counts as susp@@ icious , who , in fact , admitted the indication and led the investig@@ ators to the discovery site of the cor@@ p@@ ses .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not come home after a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of the evening .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first met personal objects of the victim .
in the course of surveys in the circle of friends and acquaintances there was finally a suspici@@ on against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ h@@ ausen where the cor@@ p@@ ses were found .
according to the authorities , the arrest was reported to the authorities to kill the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the cor@@ p@@ ses in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the port fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put a dead blow to him .
the other investigations are intended to provide information about the circumstances .
refugees need accommodation : study warns against housing shortage
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for an affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun .
with the incoming refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is now over@@ loaded in many major cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last paid flats .
to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built up to 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the result of a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison , 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany this year .
that means 14@@ 0,000 dwell@@ ings are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an initial accommodation .
many then come across the housing market and join the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers stayed for rent last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to rising refugee figures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the study also makes significant changes in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is shooting a residential deficit , which becomes larger from year to year .
currently approximately 77@@ 0,000 housing units were missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , compl@@ ains Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals therefore lived in large cities in a not@@ rated way in WG rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults stayed longer in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the l@@ utes on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the large cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has declined again for the first time in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to solve the problem , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alliance proposes a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new incentives should revi@@ ve social housing construction .
thus , the tax exemp@@ tion tax could be wai@@ ved and the basic tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats will be suspended .
in addition , according to the Alliance , attractive tax de@@ position options are required .
the funding programme for refugee shel@@ ters at Kf@@ W State Bank is already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the available 300 million euros have already been rec@@ alled on Monday evening .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia draw a corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungary there is practically no escape any more , as more and more refugees are choosing the way to Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb announces the transit through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is still dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke with the Slovenian Interior Minister , and if necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and already belongs to the Schengen zone .
the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
after the death of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border hundreds of refugees moved to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people have come across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian TV station RT@@ L .
Hungary had closed its border for refugees on the eve of the day .
new laws , which entered into force on the same day , practically obvi@@ ate the need for proper asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can go through and we prepare for this opportunity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police took up the first refugees at Serbia &apos;s border to the EU neighbourhood of Croatia in the morning .
most of the media reports come from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both by bus and taxi to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
on the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ b border , the refugees do not come across a border fence .
there are other dangers for this : there are sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 9@@ 0s .
mine clear@@ ers should now quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , after the closure of the border more refugees come to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Tuesday , the police had 3@@ 66 registered people .
shortly before the closing on Monday there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws make it possible to overcome and damage the border zone as a crime .
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the south @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
sentenced to five years imprisonment and deportation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the newly established &quot; Tran@@ sit zones , &quot; almost all of them - 93 - at the most important crossing of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants are 13 families with small children as well as two older people .
on Wednesday morning , there would have been more than 40 refugees .
however , practically no one has a prospect of being granted asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure third country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers shall be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to clean up .
they collected garbage that tens of thousands of people left at the road@@ side in recent weeks .
barrier screens were disman@@ tled and one of the record stores in the border town was remo@@ del@@ ed .
no one wanted to express themselves to the goal of this reconstruction .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria is only a few refugees .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
the 20,000 migrants considered themselves still in the country , according to government data .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the continuation of the journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped at the instruction of German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees met regularly on foot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mayor drove &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; str@@ anded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; across the border &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy after the bridge festival on Sunday , when ten people were suddenly standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly set the rail traffic with Austria on Sunday , but because of the refugee flow , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the borders together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u .
previously we had the unexpected guests , with snack and drinks .
we have already said that we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man didn &apos;t let him take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that made us very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Sunday evening in W@@ els the str@@ anded train passengers moved from an ICE to a regional train towards Passa@@ u in order to find it after the announcement that the railway traffic was adjusted to Germany , but still to try beyond the border .
the regional train was stopped at the Inn before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein on the Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Brück@@ en@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbors was soci@@ able on Sunday , Monday before a two @-@ bridge sport - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends further twenty thousand to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke &apos;s camp immediately in establishing structures that ensure humanity , our Federal Chancellor has publicly and publicly moved the position of the Hungarian government into the sphere of National Socialism .
the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chao@@ tic conditions in the bor@@ der@@ lands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will also have to note that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a big challenge to create decent states for protection @-@ seek@@ ers in view of the ongoing refugee streams and approaching winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 hi@@ ber@@ nation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the provision of refugees , Konrad has his hands full to do with the provision of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Konrad is used to his word weight .
the government has used the former mighty Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to set up lod@@ gings for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first Tak@@ eover Centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already gotten a grip on Con@@ rad .
&quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success .
also the housing of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday , was without a great host , said Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; master performance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Interior Ministry , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crisis @-@ free situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Konrad expects a total of 85@@ ,000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ nal year .
in order to meet the number , 3@@ 5.000 accommodation must be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 are to provide the countries , 15,000 of the federal government .
should there be more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a barrel without soil , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already had talks with the provincial capitals .
they would have backed him to create neighbour@@ hoods for the coming refugees too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s good in Upper Austria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow it will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born to be clari@@ fied as the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum @-@ ordin@@ ator puts great hopes in the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Help us like us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform individuals can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday , Konrad and Ma@@ ier critici@@ zed the standards for placing as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency , it could not be that j@@ uries have to maintain a certain amount of towel holders or size of the sky@@ lights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a limited time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , Con@@ rad is based on his experience .
I am an elderly gent@@ leman , whom one does not say without further into the face the fal@@ seh@@ ood .
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not cause the Republic to cost as they declared themselves .
they want to increase their number of employees in three to four .
my own quest for lod@@ gings has not been successful so far .
Konrad wanted to place a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are apparently problems with the permission .
Linz calls for a better distribution
for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , since the persons concerned can currently be submitted without these measures , says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
in the event of an emergency , however , additional locations should be checked for their suitability .
the Chief of Staff is critici@@ zed for the distribution of refugees within the federal state .
other districts also have to make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; boundaries are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone call with Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) , on Monday , negotiated the further procedure in the refugee issue .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders were not sealed off .
the continuation of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there are now the corresponding border controls .
for the time being , special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist .
however , the protective seek@@ ers would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for more reinforced solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria once again takes control of its borders is a logical consequence for P@@ ühr@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of the action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general refur@@ bish@@ ment of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industrial line is officially closed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the publicly tra@@ ded IT Group S &amp; T is moved , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT the smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; D leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in Star@@ tup @-@ companies of the New ship@@ yard and later to acquire some of them .
already from the very beginning , S &amp; T intends to cooperate with the new neighbours , of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
1.7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T to the site , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the Land of Upper Austria and the Federal Government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased to S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center for 60 years .
30 per cent of the 27@@ 00 square meter of residual space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened a second store in the arcade
in the new shop , Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are the focal point .
actually Jutta Th@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , she has now obtained an increase in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , in which it sells among other things bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to € 500 .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks had been rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have thought about whether I want to open a shop yet , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
decisive for the decision was , among other things , that Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location in which only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the great @-@ room Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who herself has Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion @-@ interest has put Br@@ eit out of her mother in the cra@@ dle .
me most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many woman in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , the professional woman can &apos;t answer with the last safety .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag of every outfit will be upgraded .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants are named An@@ ders .
this property also connects some with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for upright set@@ ups .
whether it is hostile to x@@ en@@ opho@@ bic , journalists sc@@ amm@@ ers or revealing knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. presidential office ag@@ grav@@ ates the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cuts off well .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ öh@@ n@@ fris@@ ur &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a term for many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine route . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some in the 1200 inhabitants place is related to it over -@@ ump@@ teen corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in election campaign mode .
the director Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find this somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt form , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous explo@@ sives , to which beside Tru@@ mp the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to word in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of hearts .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tru@@ mp is &quot; a bit a big mau@@ l &quot; says Wen@@ del .
coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt within a radius , &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter &quot; - to Hoch@@ deutsch : the gi@@ ver , tells her .
so Tru@@ mp comes from the village of the investors .
the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later Grand@@ father emig@@ rated and opened a place for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the corner@@ stone of the property company was the first real estate sales in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy . their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed at the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged to that time .
he didn &apos;t record Tru@@ mp because he was cut off without hom@@ olog@@ ation , the director of the Institute for pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Geschichte und Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , had declared a film start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes striking statements of the descendants .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as one pol@@ ite , this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant kin@@ ship of Tru@@ mp@@ s ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born Tru@@ mp , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the v@@ int@@ ner in retirement looks rather dist@@ anced to the Americans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so blo@@ oming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp arrives ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension inn@@ keeper Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ramm men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz &apos;s family donated something for the church organ during a visit , which was generally well anchored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that from Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they find it better if he won &apos;t win the election , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would have never arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting themes than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not my president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the President Tru@@ mp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els &apos;s film , for which Tru@@ mp was inter@@ viewed for a long time , saw 12@@ ,000 cinema singers , also in the US w@@ akes up interest .
the Upper Bavarian congregation of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain climbing village . &quot;
from the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 @-@ inhabit@@ ant village in Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing villages &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in neighbouring countries , the Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must have a maximum of 2,500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sunrise is domin@@ ating the reviews despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of leadership of the liber@@ als , but there has been no major shifts in today &apos;s reviews .
the N@@ ine breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the Ri@@ val Sunrise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Canc@@ un .
this down@@ side of the distance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , since sunrise received 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators at the five major cities , compared to today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , Today was a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , in the past few months , Today has closed the gap to Sunrise .
in August , Today reached 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ 0,000 of sunrise .
at the beginning of the year the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 was .
up to now in September , Sunrise has an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators to 3@@ 14@@ .000 at Today .
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the ex @-@ serial of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father who decides to settle with his two children along the coast of New Zealand reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators .
critics had wondered if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ter Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and easily hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e , yiel@@ ded an average of 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 until 18 : 00 ) jump@@ ed to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires &apos;s Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia generated 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour sat@@ te 7@@ 20,000 .
hot Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will give N@@ ine confidence that hot Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a substitute for a million dollars minute that failed to over@@ run the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
revealed the secret ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki possibly un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly apparently who wins The Bachelor .
the woman at which Sam Wood finally landed in The Bachelor was envel@@ op@@ ed in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows in the day before three two , you may acci@@ dentally be given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips tightly sealed on Thursday
all three women are ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their answers could become a game break@@ er who won the heart of the Bachelor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everyone named Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki quickly - except himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the very first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and noticed S@@ ams energies , I felt they were quite compatible and I thought it all over the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah stands on Earth with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
you feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to the house last week made her clear that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the One &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ condition@@ ally set to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked who Wood should choose , if not she , she was en@@ ig@@ matic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor will be broadcast on Ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams that sent en@@ quiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose San Francisco &apos;s 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a sc@@ ram@@ ble as he did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ sions at his first p@@ unt return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula tru@@ sts his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a p@@ unt @-@ return and also into the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula also strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by specialist team coordinator , Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his cat@@ ched catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a p@@ unt restored in the first game quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian ent@@ our@@ age had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne , after the F@@ um@@ ble , ble@@ w the field and later told the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a bad start into his N@@ FL career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his original debut back in 2007 when a pass had led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

at the beginning of the F@@ W autumn flap in large wall@@ stadt before a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools , there was no need for new teachers : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to save the schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get off@@ ences in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in fact , entirely different main themes were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the Free Elec@@ toral Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lap the clo@@ ister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ v@@ aj@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform national standards for federal states throughout Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

tigh@@ ter Wall Street helps D@@ ax jump on the jumps
the German stock market has closed with profits after a long @-@ term trend @-@ free and nervous trade @-@ course .
only in the afternoon saw a tigh@@ ter launch of the US stock markets for a clear direction , which ultimately promoted the D@@ ax by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8,@@ 13 points .
the M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized figure was 0.@@ 54 percent on 19 55@@ 2.@@ 88 points .
the Tec@@ D@@ ax technology @-@ based Tec@@ D@@ ax increased by 1.@@ 03 percent to 17@@ 3@@ 6,@@ 69 points .
the Euro@@ St@@ ox@@ x 50 as the main index of the euro area declined by 1.@@ 01 percent to 3@@ 20@@ 7.@@ 60 points .
solid earnings also earned the trading places in London and Paris .
in the US , the Dow Jones Index last recorded around 1 percent in the plus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many stock markets predict that the markets will be replaced by the interest in the US and also for the large decline in the fut@@ ures trading on this Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the meantime , RW@@ E &apos;s share of RW@@ E shares has been de@@ pressed to a record low and left its mark on E@@ on .
according to Spiegel , the German energy companies possibly lack 30 billion euros of provisions .
the Federal Government has denied the numbers stated in the press .
the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered slightly , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .
Infin@@ eon shares rose by a further 3.@@ 22 percent on the D@@ ax peak .
according to a dealer , a positive report of the US magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; caused the weekend .
as a result , investors now paid little attention to the German chip@@ maker .
in doing so , investments in future wafer technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off .
car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer months of August , more cars were again set off than in the same period of the previous year , as the industry association AC@@ EA announced at the start of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt .
the documents of the Daimler and BMW motor@@ ways increased by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
Volkswagen assets declined by 1.@@ 26 percent .
on the German pension market , the return on circulation of listed federal securities amounted to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.@@ 50 ) percent .
the pension index Re@@ x increased by 0.@@ 12 percent to 13@@ 9.@@ 55 points .
the federal government lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4.@@ 11 points .
in the afternoon the price of the euro dropped to 1.@@ 12@@ 62 dollars .

4 People killed after police shooting rubber bul@@ lets on prot@@ esters in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police fired rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , said a official on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ expan@@ i district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , senior official , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , with some of them throwing stones and incen@@ diary bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police have used tear gas and then shot in the air before res@@ or@@ ting to rub@@ bers .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the used rubber shells , known to be able to kill , which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , obviously produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces being formed within the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in the western Nepal of the ethnic group of Th@@ arus , who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were killed in violent confron@@ tations since the 10th .
killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial topic in Nepal which has been centrally ruled for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ator acceler@@ ates the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
this week , the legislature voted on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the plot of the Em@@ den youth centre Alte Post shall be built again .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter area .
a mixture of trade , trade and living is planned , but there are still no concrete offers .
Em@@ den - Em@@ den city plans to market an area of about 4000 square metres in direct proximity to the Alte Post youth centre .
the preparations for this are underway .
it is planned to use the premises for a mix of trade , trade and housing .
wait for appropriate offers , that is to say on the part of the city .
which investor want to question is not yet clear .
accordingly , no agreements have been concluded .
the city of Em@@ den had bought a part of the property , which is located at the Ring@@ straße / Corner , just a few months ago and demoli@@ shed the building on it .
H@@ ieve Project : details lying on the table
the planning of the holiday house at the Little Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
several An@@ li@@ eger are further wor@@ rying - they fear res@@ ale of their leisure agent
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; months ang was negotiated , gri@@ pped , deb@@ ated and dra@@ fted behind closed doors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the plans for a new holiday house on the small sea close to Em@@ den on the table .
the Inter@@ est , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ der Company &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time in the municipal development committee of the Em@@ der Council on Monday evening .
originally this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP Group , which accused the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ inger went on the offensive from the system construction management : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all the ru@@ mo@@ urs .
for months , this project has been in the discussion for some ten to twelve million euros .
intense reactions among sea @-@ bu@@ d owners who came to the meeting called forth the pictures and new details of the desired hotel building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea and board member in the interests of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a giant cla@@ d over@@ looked by all the other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , he fears like many other project critics , that the traffic would greatly increase by the intended size of the system : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the bus@@ hings must come in order for this to be reck@@ oned , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on the approximately one hectare site of the former restaurant , however , is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we need to have a coher@@ ent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still missing , the development plans were still variable .

Google launches double donation campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a double donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees fle@@ eing the European nations as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach when announc@@ ing the donations call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google associate , who had fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our trip included many dark stations and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global funds raised up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / will be doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is faced with the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely due to the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many escaped from the war torn by war , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly over@@ weight diabe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly over@@ weight people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether slightly over@@ weight people with diabetes will live longer with diabetes after losing weight loss than those who do not receive surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mort@@ ality data takes a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity has proven to be efficient for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been conducted in people who are obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is over@@ weight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ese Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital used data collected in a study since 2007 , comparing two types of obesity and ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly over@@ weight .
the average BM@@ I among those who underwent this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments roughly equal to 29 .
among those who underwent surgical intervention , 36 % of the diabetes was totally dis@@ b@@ anded and at 28 % in part .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , in comparison with diabetes , diabetes was completely dissolved at only one percent and in some cases only about two percent .
in addition , the results in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol &quot; were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group &apos; , the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the operation , the average ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce mort@@ ality in five years , so the senior researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared the average results of the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ re@@ tom@@ y group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater responses in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and noted rather a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications of a study of heavy people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone of the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people who underwent obesity , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it is soothing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have strongly linked their body with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is a theme that is increasingly noticed in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets after years the flock of her youth , and he falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tually we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel should especially be interesting for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the main professional author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot absorb all the refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East was lying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist Guide called for an end to violence in the home countries of refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the UK in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be faced with the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admir@@ able , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in cop@@ ing with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions like real peace and true development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we need to think about how the killing is less@@ ened in their countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the issue of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack on September 11 and turned out that the violent response of the United States pulled a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I have expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him that the way to solving this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence and this caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of intake of dis@@ infection by children in the last 4 years
pollution control centres in the United States report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years that swal@@ low strongly alcoholic hand dis@@ infection agents , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of revenue of hand dis@@ infection products in children under 12 years of age , the poison control centers report , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are getting more and more common to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them land in the emergency situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children intentionally drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ant in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how young people disinf@@ ect@@ ants only drink because of a cheap experience .
young@@ sters have supposedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with soft mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very appealing for children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 per cent alcohol .
a few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation especially in infants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , medical director of the poison emergency centre in the hospital of K@@ ans@@ as University , the Fox 4 station in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave a si@@ p whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , then it is a quick way to consume lots of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently had four sp@@ lashes of after straw@@ berry frag@@ rant disinf@@ ect@@ ant in school , was taken into an emergency room for treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is legally drunk with an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency medical doctor who treated her at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah insist@@ ed on her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the sign of Hir@@ n @-@ trauma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had pushed the head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ecting clo@@ ths and store disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
beyond alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with fat@@ alities .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario for the swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing toxic , non @-@ declared ingredients .
health authorities employees suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a mort@@ al solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was listed as active agent .
in January three students of the fourth grade in New York were planning to poison their &quot; nasty &quot; teacher by expos@@ ing anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; says a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and banned them from their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police examined the condemned plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; g@@ ossi@@ p &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and referred to disciplinary measures to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three cars damaged

a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove to the roundabout in the direction of the roundabout and was too late to notice that two preceding cars had stopped at the roundabout .
as a result , he colli@@ ded with his truck into the rear of an audi@@ tor and pushed this vehicle to a Ford Fi@@ esta .
the vehicles involved in the accident were damaged by some 10,000 euros , the police shares with them .
the Audi of the 33 year old was no longer available and had to be tow@@ ed .

Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ season gave Aber@@ deen a scar@@ ce victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e , so that the D@@ ons create a five @-@ point gap between himself and Celtic .
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays talk about dis@@ cord
there are rum@@ ors about dis@@ cord at Celtic Glasgow , which was spontaneously rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths . this insist@@ ed that he and his team mates are not under increased control as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch leader .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football is bored by Dutch - de Bo@@ er
former R@@ angers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland they don &apos;t show any highlights of the Celtic games anymore and why ? &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here talk not only about the return of the R@@ angers .
they talk about the Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
there is a lot of tension in the Old Firm games and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la accepted that Celtic has to fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the following departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , now with five points lead straight to the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel this way - but we have to go on .
we really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players better .
joining now is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton careful at January transfers

the players coming in the summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group during this season .
the crew is really good .
sometimes more damage is caused by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

the Hear@@ ts led 2 : 1 when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent out of the field and then lost 3 : 2 , but the Red Card of Defender was later removed - the third red card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said and insist@@ ed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not questioned any integrity , I have not commented on any achievement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid ty@@ nec@@ ologist
the in@@ cor@@ rigi@@ ble hi@@ bee was rebu@@ ked after he admitted to have a song sung with infectious lyrics about ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Rud@@ i Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident occurred in a pub in the area of Ros@@ eb@@ urn from Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was Der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the storm , and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is safe to say that I don &apos;t return to Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le if it does not play for Celtic Glasgow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team from Aber@@ deen didn &apos;t have to fight for Hamilton Ac@@ cies in order to see a seventh consecutive league win that brought them a lead of five points to Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won everything , in poker games or le@@ agues that have won &apos;t win the games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while it increases overall in the United Kingdom .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without labor for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was over that of the UK@@ s 5.5 percent , as the figures of the Bureau of National Statistics ( O@@ NS ) showed .
in the meantime , jobs in Scotland decreased by 12.@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
the employment rate for Scotland decreased to 7@@ 4.2 percent over the course of the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a drop in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;

why I &apos;m witn@@ essing an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
somewhat later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man will be put to death .
when it happens and I hope it does not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the Death Pen@@ al at O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death .
the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
as the day drew ni@@ gh , I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agree , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the USA , and since more applications are available as places , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
those who are selected will observe it emo@@ tionally .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps , close friend , with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we laugh often when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma acc@@ uses me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner as he wants and you get access .
I compl@@ ained to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could have better shape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong , what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations work will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Bar@@ ry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of the deed .
but I believe that there is a strong possibility that he is not guilty of murder .
I am sure there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I think its execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I can &apos;t pret@@ end to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters you can contact for that .
what you get from me is what it means to see a man die of unnecessary death .
man after wet police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist remained dry when he talked to the man of the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few metres from a police officer who tried to persu@@ ade him to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called on Tuesday to a C@@ anning C@@ emet@@ ry incident in pel@@ vic .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them towards the C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior ser@@ ge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A good polic@@ eman negotiated &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior ser@@ ge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ in drove his car into the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to float across the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to finish the race
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy says that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he pointed to the ste@@ wards and the Integr@@ ity Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what is best for the race and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt @-@ ta@@ u test in Li@@ dar@@ is that he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had with@@ held for 18 months due to the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age repro@@ aches and did not want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like zu &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ oo@@ dy said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know it went on .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with that which I have said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk around my head and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
when they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be more trainers .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously , M@@ oo@@ dy had to raise the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stall .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I &apos;m going to name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do inside my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com .
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses , because they failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , reig@@ ning president of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this and are still today .
should this make me think that it will be personal ?
has the R@@ V@@ L beha@@ ves in a cow@@ ard@@ ly manner and perhaps makes people outside of coaches responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe the people are thinking outside that I am .
maybe they have to take my license and drive me off , and I have no doubt that what I say makes them think about it now .
but now I have arrived at the point that doesn &apos;t matter to me , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the trainers &apos; fru@@ stration levels have built up with Li@@ dar@@ i &apos;s long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt research , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation for the un@@ defeated master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse debate , which drove against the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my colleagues mistakenly put mud on the leg .
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been like that yesterday , which was so .
but it was also so on the day of the race .
M@@ oo@@ dy might be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but one has gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy returns against ri@@ vals for claims to ring games
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has called criticism at the Tac@@ kl@@ ing of its players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favourites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the judges allowed the Storm players &quot; ring matches &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne B@@ enn@@ ett made a barely covered remark to the Storm team after his team had achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; example &quot; of the rug@@ by league and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in rings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the fli@@ ck@@ ety of his crew and said that they were only focused on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the Tac@@ kl@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading trainers in his team would give him confidence , because they worried they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is time and time again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about ring fights when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have not changed our def@@ en@@ sive system or techniques throughout the year , but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles a real focus , and this has provided the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and obviously has a great team to train . so he is probably not used to losing it , so it was a bit a shock for him .
it is funny how this time and time it appears again and again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy attacked B@@ enn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that B@@ enn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring soccer . &quot;
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his play on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a te@@ di@@ ous team , and Way@@ ne said that he will take care of a cra@@ p .
but now he has a team that can play and that we watch as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this type of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt , so they can play like this .
I build stronger faith because they say these things because they are a bit worried about having to play against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think about us when it was about the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters played a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
the game of Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks made and no points a little clamping ?
for me it &apos;s the game plans .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a phase .
the Storm team is free on this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks next Saturday night at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin on next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ deposit acc@@ . to drug ad@@ diction
a man who may possibly have a life @-@ long punishment due to his attempt to get into the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a $ 200,000 deposit .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who arrived from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and put in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was watched as he met his co @-@ accused in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era road@@ house where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a possibly life @-@ long punishment for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole quantity and that in the café could have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was worried about the danger of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday .
in the case of a criminal complaint , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars in common to reach his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its of the two people it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said judge Flan@@ agan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone won &apos;t be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against deposit , under the conditions that he aband@@ ons his Australian and his Serbian passport , noti@@ fying himself with the police every day and adher@@ es to a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident at A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab tears apart
in case of a collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks that took part had slow@@ ed down in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left at the last moment , as the police said .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident @-@ causing plan was torn apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely blocked for six hours until 2 a.@@ m .
there was a damage in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone of girls to l@@ ure ped@@ ophi@@ le to send pictures
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the phone of a 11 year old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone when she was asleep , logged into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of continuous images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ er@@ ted her mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analyzed the computer found at the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web searches , which used terms for the search for continuous images of children .
H@@ og@@ g then claimed to the function@@ aries that he did it , since it would lead to &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ le on the Internet &quot; and then &quot; preten@@ ding to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said to the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be addic@@ ted to sc@@ are people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that searching on the computer were carried out by him , but said it had happened because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked to send more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
he said he was sick in his head when he drinks and said he would then see images of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and crying .
she then also saw the un@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the defend@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused used computer and pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the In@@ dict@@ ment of the In@@ decent Images of Children on 14 June last year to have bre@@ wed on 25 January this year and did not appear before the Tribunal on 24 March this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defence counsel Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g does not appear in the register of sexual off@@ ences since one could argue that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be found in his crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ es the verdict until October to obtain background reports on social work .
H@@ og@@ g was ref@@ unded in this case , but was held in custody because of hear@@ ings to other cases still pending .
he was added to the directory of sexual off@@ ences before the date of judgment .
drag on small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up from the main control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many locks left the people with fear of discovery and sei@@ zing people at smaller border cross@@ ings .
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
more than 1000 refugees have been picked up in the Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn districts since Tuesday .
they were on foot across bridges and dam@@ s to the German side .
there they are received by Bundes@@ polic@@ emen and forwarded to the registration .
a lot more refugees met at Munich Central Station compared to the beginning of the week on Wednesday .
only by 8 : 00 am about 700 people have arrived in the state capital , said a speaker in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls at the German @-@ Austrian border , refugees reached the city on Tuesday , 17@@ 59 .
Stuttgart : runner @-@ up of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the southwest expected
meteor@@ ologists warn of storm o@@ aks in the south @-@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe currently hot sea air flows into the country , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) distributed in Stuttgart .
the strong low is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; who had moved from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic over the past few days .
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
according to D@@ WD , until Thursday morning also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Lake Constance District with goats from 60 to 90 km / h .
so on Friday we can see the sun again .
the mass makes it : every two years the car manufacturers show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
2015 is above all to be seen in the compact cars , which are currently particularly well selling .
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : approximately 28.@@ 1 percent of new registrations fell to this segment in August alone , according to the Federal Aviation Office ( KBA ) .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( public stage 17 to 27 September ) .
many new compact models will be introduced this year between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars .
one of the largest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra will not be much more expensive either .
Opel is launching an entry under the largest competi@@ tor VW Golf in prospect , starting at 17,@@ 650 euros .
the current Astra costs from 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is powered by a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
the H@@ esse also offers other diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , among which three @-@ cylinder petrol engines are for the first time .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only five @-@ door .
the second version will follow in the spring of the comb@@ i , which can be seen at the IAA .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA still on new compact cars ?
Renault Meg@@ gan@@ e : Renault is launching the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor , Mé@@ gan@@ e .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e can be seen only as five @-@ door in a conventional and an under@@ stated sporty GT version .
in the trade he comes in the beginning of next year , then also as a com@@ bo .
Infin@@ iti : quite new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan @-@ c@@ anti@@ lever wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines fits perfectly into the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , who celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications at 170 Newton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is scheduled for spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not entirely new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA .
on the outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n design placed hand in front of the front panel : the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn here and the modified head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , especially the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons is reduced by a touch screen and for the first time integrated Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play .
in addition , at the IAA in the compact class , a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI are also available .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are un@@ deser@@ ted
the Federal Constitutional Court justified an ex @-@ prisoner of the prison sentence Te@@ gel , which was housed in a too small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , det@@ ain@@ ees are fundamentally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells .
this was the decision of the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision that was published on Wednesday .
the persons concerned can even hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
as a result , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful : he was housed in a single cell with around five square metres of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated .
after that , the man , who , according to his lawyer , was now on the free foot , had been transferred to a larger cell .
his term of office because of the un@@ worthy conditions of arrest against the State of Berlin failed .
but the Constitutional Jud@@ ges raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Justice and returned the case back to the trial .
they see the man &apos;s human dignity hurt .
court court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons only a few days of imprisonment for the compensation were decisive , a compensation claim was given , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cur@@ v@@ ature of the legal protection of the personality would be to be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Court of Appe@@ al must now clarify the amount of money la@@ under@@ ing .
in the past , the constitu@@ ents have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of war .
in April , they only spoke of a det@@ ain@@ ee in April because he was locked naked in a cell .
according to a 2011 decision , the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet is also un@@ deser@@ ving .
furthermore , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had certified an in@@ decent housing in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the plain@@ ti@@ ff was lod@@ ged daily between 15 and 21 hours a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons had arrived in the head@@ lines for lack of personnel in the last few weeks .
det@@ ain@@ ees are therefore locked again and again for 23 hours , increasing the aggres@@ si@@ veness , even being pun@@ ish@@ able due to the ten@@ se situation .
according to information from the Ministry of Justice , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to the lack of young candidates , 19 are to be om@@ itted in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the chan@@ cell@@ or is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
according to forecasts of the Federal Ministry of the Interior , some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany this year , according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrates determination in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different forecasts , between 3@@ 50@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Construction ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are used every year - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it is currently being built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all at affordable rental objects : every year , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social housing units fall out of the rental price , and these particularly favorable apartments will also apply for refugees .
therefore , Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the promotion , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
this is far too little from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing per year would have to arise and therefore the federal government would have to invest 6.@@ 4 billion a year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both scientists and federal mini@@ stries agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it is assumed that in the long term 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed .
however , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked for their qualifications in order to help them get started , Claudia Walter , a project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation , critic@@ ises .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for the integration of refugees it is crucial whether they find work in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the reception society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to the Thr@@ es@@ hardt , there has been a political turn : from the prohibition of work for refugees to recognise labour .
while there was previously a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just like the residen@@ cy obligation that asylum seek@@ ers have limited to a place of residence .
in society - also because of the shortage of skilled workers , the view was mostly established that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly .
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is a lack of knowledge of German .
up to now there is not a sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
research also shows that jobs are most often im@@ par@@ ted through personal contact .
therefore , the structure of networks is , according to the opinion of Thr@@ än@@ hardt , the royal road to work integration .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few refugees give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the parents who have been rooted , it is very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ zy@@ bar , Spo@@ kes@@ person for Youth and Family at the Berlin Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the management distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
should the need for educ@@ ators rise strongly due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of training - for example by allowing more specialised schools .
in the countries , students are prepared for teaching without knowledge of the German language .
however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also from teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ags from the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk appreci@@ ates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no federal state prohibited asylum seek@@ ers or tolerated the study - the only exception to date was Berlin , the internal sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his stance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Studi@@ er@@ wil@@ ligen refugees could be easier to access the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because refugees with a residence permit or de@@ ple@@ tion do not receive services according to the asylum application law more if they start a study .
the latter generally do not get a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of the b@@ af@@ ö@@ d people .
tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 , this period will be shortened to 15 months .
however , this financing gap must also be closed , calls for Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should immediately get b@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in future because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually enter into Islam the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state church right to develop a new state @-@ religions relationship .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association , which takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally .
rights also include duties .
in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him certain controls .
this also includes a willingness to take heed to religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday , religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany .
those who wanted to off@@ end such conflicts in Germany , &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will be a topic of the whole of society much more than today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will also have to change the majority society , the elimination of discrimination and racism is more pressing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general equality law for a decade .
but it slowly lear@@ ns how the NS@@ U @-@ M@@ ord@@ series showed that police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motif .
equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and interest groups do not ob@@ lige white Germans for a long time and for which international tre@@ aties such as the anti @-@ racism convention Germany undertake , must become reality in the coming years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens should take advantage of its opportunities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is capable of medi@@ cally supplying the refugees to date , says President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as man@@ - power and capacities are concerned , we create it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery asks all the newcom@@ ers to sign up with the registration of health cards .
services rendered may be calculated later with the federal states .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to cr@@ ush so many people with the limited power catalogue that the asylum seek@@ er &apos;s law of asylum fores@@ ees .
apart from that , doctors mainly do the language barriers .
the Berlin health scientist , The@@ a Bor@@ de , has already proven that migrants are more poorly informed about their diseases than other patients .
not only in clinics , also in medical practices , interpre@@ ting costs would need to be taken over , it demands .
but many refugees have been helped with more general emergency appointments in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with a different diagnostic look .
for example , there are significantly more disability @-@ related disability among refugee children , and the youth deal with HIV @-@ En@@ ligh@@ tenment .
with some of the other cases of disease , German doctors came from their training , but Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the angel , the refugees may even have relief in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians had a highly developed educational system , some refugees are doctors .
in order to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take the test again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill according to estimates by the Bundes@@ psycho@@ therap@@ e@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from post @-@ traum@@ atic stress disorder or depression .
notably vulnerable to refugee children , Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study by the TU München shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ traum@@ atic stress disorder , among other things , suffer from so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rage and death suffer@@ ings .
other symptoms are sleep and concentration problems , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms from chronic , early treatment was necessary , said Mun@@ z .
however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees have received psycho@@ therapy .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , psych@@ ologically sick asylum seek@@ ers can submit a request for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , but the treatment usually lasts for several months .
in addition , in the social offices , specialists or doctors , who are not trained for mental illness , would decide whether or not a therapy is necessary .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production , Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus art . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to attract any age group to captiv@@ ating ac@@ rob@@ atics , veter@@ inary dres@@ sers and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst looks into the man@@ ege on the brick v@@ ases to dream .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , T@@ erle@@ hr@@ erin and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the topical management of the exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more than 33 years , the Circus is in the hands of the family Pro@@ bst .
the gift to enthusiasts is thus in the blood of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to us to take people away from their everyday life and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almond cocktail with world city flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 kilometer tour can now experience this flair .
the program of Circus convinces with talented artists from all over the world .
awarded at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family attracts the audience with wi@@ t and charm .
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent films , the Cub@@ an duo wants to easily record .
light@@ ness and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is meant to conquer women &apos;s hearts in a storm .
besides numerous laugh@@ ing sal@@ ons , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with dex@@ ter@@ ity and jo@@ int@@ iness .
balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
there is no problem for He Yuan .
sn@@ ak@@ e@@ people fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics just like little others and fascin@@ ates with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every way .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; stresses Steph@@ an@@ ies &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
ab@@ norm@@ alities in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are only too often the subject of various animal welfare organizations .
Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; if it doesn &apos;t work well for our animals , it is not good for us . &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every stroke unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are called aff@@ ection@@ ately , is read by the eyes of every wish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel well , it does not want to go into the arena .
the highest commandment , therefore , is good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the family Pro@@ bst looks proudly .
the two animals lived together eight years in a walk and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the Man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
so there should be something for each visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if five or 1,@@ 200 people , we always give our best and are part of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst looks forward to his performances from 17 to 20 September daily at 5 pm and 8 pm .
on Sunday , the program begins at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is family day , prices are reduced for the presentation at 5 p.m .
the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe runs the wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by alleg@@ ations by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with calls .
last month they had burned it and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones that they warned against interfer@@ ing with Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he told journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the members concerned that immunity will end in parliament , and as soon as they leave Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hewlett @-@ Packard will replace up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and service activities .
the expected job reductions will result in a burden of more than $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , &quot; said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive who should lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today , and we have a wide and deeper portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be focused on providing unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the company &apos;s statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it spl@@ its a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University , Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard , to manufacture electrical systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage was called &quot; the birth@@ place of the Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to handle the turn@@ around of traditional PCs towards mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this sector that is based on the belief that closely focused companies provide better performance .
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates must face the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the pen@@ ultimate Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger pointed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September , and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England , and in the face of his history his involvement in the European Championship is uncertain .
the big dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles , nor with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also acknow@@ le@@ dges , there is the danger of further injuries whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the study of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of arsen@@ als 157 league games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for Arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League Clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 that have recorded most of the vulner@@ ability stage .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes when you come back from a injury , you have a vulnerable period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain strength , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
Arsen@@ al begins his Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns out a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not travel to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep balance and allow the players who need to take a little break off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favourites are to go on through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest intim@@ id@@ ation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is also defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has started in the last season .
the stadium was hit by an earthquake on Tuesday night , measured on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation to Monaco , and remains driven by far @-@ away hope to lead the association to its first European Cup triumph with its management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked at Arsen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
friendship Fest : the com@@ edy show giving us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the lack of similar shows in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up now has become more desperate as ever before , like suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men between 20 and 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ aig@@ n Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Camp@@ aig@@ n against a mis@@ erable life ) 2015 announced as the year of the man with the aim of ques@@ tioning the culture that men prevent to seek help when they need them .
friendship is the heart of the battle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery were doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends , so that friendship may work .
in the age of communication linked to social media , with its emphasis on the style of substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong , life @-@ joyful and successful , even if in reality isolation dominates .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , everything at the expense of intrin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health much deeper .
and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy happiness .
the Schön@@ e with Friends was that this focuss@@ ing was put on the head .
each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which was shining through interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , moments in football coaching in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross in Rachel - all that came from the knowledge that men can refer to each case , even though they often restra@@ ined to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a phone call employee , I explained : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and self @-@ murder has shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact , like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if one talks about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it presents quite clearly the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status over the phone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend with the completely re@@ designed setting for the celebration of the day , why not take your friends for a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or even better if you see someone sitting in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say h@@ ello .
you never know what difference your friendship might make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria makes his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani were on track when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who took the French master on the way , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish Master , as they do not only strive for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed opportunities in front of the goal . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with which he started his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League , so it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause problems and look back at ease , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect over the course of the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we haven &apos;t yet scored one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team who could last a 2 : 2 draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the First Division , but he was expelled by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an imp@@ eller was referred to as the man who can take PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over last month from Manchester United , and he interpreted why , when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he ended up passing Johan Wil@@ and into the long corner of the net .
however , if anyone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , it was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , which hit Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , joined the field with nine national players and was a heavy opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field .
but besides a shot of Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s pole in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in advance .
instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes gave up , with some mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ances and bad connections , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was scra@@ pped in the first half of not less than five trials and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ boot .
nevertheless he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shooting that was passed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an thus achieved his sixth win after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had caught up a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö can come back into play , and only an excellent grip of wild and short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could hold the end result down before substitute players Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi finished a goal at the end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class about his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our last champion @-@ league game was last year in December . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , we only played in the Swedish league , which did not have the same level .
the qualifying matches are not enough . &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core collects 2.5 billion $ through stock sales
the Swiss @-@ based mining giant Gl@@ en@@ core , which is affected by collap@@ sing raw materials prices , collected $ 2.5 billion on Wednesday through a stock sale as part of its vast redemption plan .
the company Gl@@ en@@ core , registered in London , stated in an explanation that it sold new shares worth about £ 1.6 billion in order to pay off its own debts .
the company , which lost 57 per cent of its market value this year , struggles with falling commodity prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn expresses demand and impacts on markets .
the issue of subscription rights led to a rapid increase in the end of the London stock exchange on early Wednesday morning .
the share jump@@ ed by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Gl@@ en@@ core had announced the 2.5 billion $ share sale last week as part of the more comprehensive plans to pay around a third of its 30 billion $ debts .
the company sold the new shares to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on Tuesday &apos;s closing price .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the group .
concerns regarding long @-@ term growth in China have decreased iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other raw material prices decreased by 20 to 40 percent .

the White House confirmed Xi Jin@@ ping &apos;s visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month , confirmed the White House in a statement on Tuesday .
the visit , the first official in Washington , takes place on 25 September , and President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing in November , said the statement .
the US President and the First Lady Mich@@ elle Obama will also be host to Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a Sta@@ ats D@@ iner , after the two leaders had bilateral talks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President xis Visit will offer the opportunity to bro@@ aden the American @-@ Chinese cooperation with a number of global , regional and bilateral topics of common interest , but at the same time President Obama and President Xi can give the opportunity to construc@@ tively approach areas of dis@@ agreement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adds the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI , whose visit was first announced in February , is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington , before travelling to the UN General Assembly in September .
it is expected that Obama and Xi are addressing a number of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber@@ spi@@ on@@ age of China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea .

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 switch to FC Bayern
world champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously a few years ago shortly before the commitment of Spain Super@@ star X@@ avi , who then played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times champion winner , four times champion league winners , twice the World Champion , twice world champion , twice world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking .
in summer the meanwhile 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona for 24 years and moved to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca X@@ avi soon reveals that he was in front of Barcelona before the 2008 European Championship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won everything back then , we don &apos;t , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered user of FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ mi@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
guar@@ ano was the reason that X@@ avi didn &apos;t change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive factor for this is working today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ avi explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed a treaty and I played a great European Championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he could not imagine the crew without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that he has won me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 would have run with X@@ avi .
X@@ avi was standing for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians over the entire distance on the grass , switched the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the king &apos;s victory in the end .
matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confronted the African film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she wasn &apos;t needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives , with regard to a black protagon@@ ist in the selected script of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we talk about diversity , then do it with the cast of the film and not in the cast of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Brown re@@ acted shocked , with ins@@ ane dis@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian settled . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer colleagues Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ le@@ brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to encourage people to think about - whoever will be the director - how they treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a s@@ ut@@ te , beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p .
the producer of Dear White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on said that their directing &quot; at the end of us could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni squee@@ zed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on &quot; talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their variety - that &apos;s SO KNO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 le@@ kes since its publication .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments arrive at a time when precise rac@@ ist representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved a nationwide effect and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against colour content .
in February the singer Prince made a recording on the movement during the introduction of nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; album still matter , &quot; he said .
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , Chief of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter published an explanation in response to the question of the Fox News Person@@ ality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate @-@ group .
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; the leaders said .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media players who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope , is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowned First Champion
professional sports clim@@ ber and operating assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete , who won the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which completed her 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant which could finish all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final .
the last job was climbing at a climbing rope of 75 feet in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time with which he was the first ath@@ lete to complete the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! messages after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under shock over winning the Great Prize of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his pile of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all of a sudden ... as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , didn &apos;t receive any prize money .
according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , the one gets the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much the money is a wonderful price and the life changes , it receives the great gratu@@ ity .
I don &apos;t think he won any gru@@ dge .
he has just been so happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be struck by someone , then I am glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt exactly as if they had changed the roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season , shooting will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
earlier they were once one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field on Tuesday .
T@@ wins gave a chance to climb inside a half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ sie .
tiger Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) was defeated 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and made three rounds .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bul@@ l@@ pen each game , and therefore I want to go quite concentrated in the game .
the designated tiger hit Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid August .
it was the first three hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z ever since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has sw@@ ung the wood well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said E@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the ( kick training ) , looked much better at the Bull@@ ring and he brought it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the am@@ bush at the end of the seventh inside the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into play .
center Fiel@@ ds B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ ds Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a B@@ unt , and Simon brought his second bass player Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out , before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the designated ro@@ ok@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a Two @-@ Run bite to the right @-@ handed drummer , Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the end @-@ run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third bass @-@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the 27th time in the major league this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe made a double play
after completing a Insurance Run at the end of the ninth inside , Wall came a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed sho@@ oter , however , st@@ alls S@@ ano with three Pit@@ ches for his fifth save .
Detroit benefited from the start of the game by a still not moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been deleted before the game from the vulner@@ ability list after he had been missing more than a month because of a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitch as in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first time , Hus@@ hes released a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; in the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 series of successes with the Run@@ ners in the scor@@ ing position .
the third bass player Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third what the threat ended .
the Tig@@ ers ranked second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out single from Center Fiel@@ ds Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he didn &apos;t beat him very well , but he caught the right spot .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the rel@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
Hu@@ gh@@ es came to three rounds with six hits and a walk with four stro@@ kes .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the worm guilty .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the S@@ shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the list of injuries because of a shoulder block , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP becomes Daniel Mor@@ ris from the vulner@@ ability list to start against T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers , since he was purchased in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing on the right hip of the hip since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will end their series of three matches at Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees are to be accommodated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the most anger@@ ed people should then be accommodated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden did in the evening on Tuesday evening .
it calculated with 450 to 750 forthcoming refugees .
several sports halls of the H@@ essi@@ an state capital had been prepared for this event in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily be accommodated there .
they should then be distributed to other municipalities .
according to the government pres@@ idency , responsible for the initial admission , 7@@ 500 people in Hessen have arrived alone in the past ten days .
due to the large number of refugees , Frankfurt and Han@@ au also established emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that the decisive reflections on military action options should not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he accused the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective sign@@ age &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was happy that the cup of a military participation in Germany has passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict erup@@ ts at our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deut@@ schland@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive surge in international aid on the spot for refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Minister of the Interior , Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , declared on Tuesday evening at the Austrian television station ORF , but no one will be sent back to Hungary .
Germany too did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it &apos;s agreed so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement on which Germany could host a specific number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner said it had already given talks between the Director @-@ General for Public Security and Represent@@ atives of Germany .
she did not call concrete figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days tens of thousands of refugees passed the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary to Austria .
their destination is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann , together with several other EU leaders , requested a special summit next week .
Germany began on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not so far been able to agree on a common approach to the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers want to take a new start to the binding distribution of further 120 000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the strong refugee status in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries in the initial acquisition and distribution of people more strongly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the federal government will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on Tuesday evening after almost four hour consultations with the Prime Ministers in the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lined , those people who needed protection , complain also .
but those who don &apos;t have a lead perspective can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this view had been dealt with in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now handle a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route .
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometers long border to Serbia on Tuesday .
a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border to Romania was shut down with a fence .
this neighboring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wants to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers seeking ev@@ ils over Romania , &quot; said Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government promptly condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports , thousands of migrants arrived in Turkey on their way to the Greek border .
room probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds Ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us

&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes researchers from observations of the space pro@@ bes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the moon is easily te@@ aming up on its orbit around the ring planets .
although it is only small but nevertheless too large for a continuous solid heavenly body , it is stated in a communication from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state of New York ) on Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
it was already longer known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; discovered iron vul@@ can@@ es in 2006 on the South Pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds , sp@@ it water vap@@ or and ice particles and feed the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the South Pole , there must be a sub@@ terranean sea , closed the astronom@@ ers back then .
the expansion of the hidden ocean , however , was not clear .
R@@ ama missing 1860 München several weeks ago
the 1860 München has to wai@@ ve Val@@ det R@@ ama for about a month .
an investigation has resulted in an ad@@ duc@@ tor infrin@@ gement from the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association announced .
R@@ ama compl@@ ained about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Munich &apos;s lion , the diagnosis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presumably four weeks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compul@@ sive break &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is difficult for us , R@@ ama is a bitter loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we must now think &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said sports director Nec@@ at Ay@@ g@@ ün the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper with a look at the possible commitment of an un@@ compromising pro@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , as a training guest , the Six@@ ties presented a defensive guard at first .
the 30 year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at is currently &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the possibility to prove his skills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

contrary to the first ap@@ pre@@ hen@@ sions , however , he remained without a serious sh@@ out .
no diet fruit - Mang@@ os contain much sugar
Mang@@ os are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line is often dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
they contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
the exotic fruits are healthy nevertheless : in them , B vitamins , as well as the vitamins E and C. In particular , Mang@@ os contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits thus support vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too strong and pleasant to smell .
the peel color alone does not say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ gos can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste of course pure or in sweet dishes .
but a man@@ go also gives sa@@ vory dishes a special touch .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .

in the coming night , in the valleys of the Alps of the Alps , the F@@ öh@@ n passes through , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz ha@@ st@@ ened on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night to th@@ urs@@ day the fo@@ eh@@ n blows partly with storm @-@ strength through the F@@ öh@@ n@@ valleys .
after F@@ öh@@ n@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a distinctive cold front , which brings strong ra@@ ins , wind gu@@ sts and a decline in temperature .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive grav@@ ure area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest exposure .
on the north side of the Alps , the cave breaks through the valleys on the night of the F@@ öh@@ n .
as a result , the F@@ öh@@ n blows from 60 to 100 km / h in the F@@ öh@@ n@@ valleys until Thursday morning and partly in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h .
the fo@@ eh@@ n can advance on site @-@ wise to the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains even Or@@ be@@ gu@@ ans of more than 120 km / h are possible .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my fo@@ eh@@ n provides for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to st@@ ow away on the slope of the Alps .
here , rain sets in , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , more than 100 litres of rain per square meter have to be expected in the south of the Alps in the next 48 hours , after large rainf@@ alls have already fallen in recent days .
on Thursday morning the blow goes out , as a result rolls a cold front with a strong , partly swe@@ at@@ y rain from west to east over Switzerland .
together with the cold front , the wind is blowing strongly until stor@@ my , and the temperatures drop considerably .
the following days present themselves in the north autumn with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south on the other hand it will be sunny on the weekend and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther memorial in Rome .
in the presence of City President Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was bapti@@ sed on the name of the German Re@@ former .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he is now honoured as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is right in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working community of the Protestant Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often only live their faith in the city of the Pop@@ es over the centuries .
with the square , in a symbolic way , it becomes apparent that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k , Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) held a few months in Rome for the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 .
he felt the city at that time as a corrupt sin@@ ner .
his negative impressions might have strengthened him according to historians in his later fight against Rome .
with his theses on Ab@@ las@@ sh@@ andel , Luther had then initiated the division of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church .
hammer Artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown of thorns is one of the main works created by Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt Bible , which has now appeared with splendid images .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who in 150 pictures formul@@ ates his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has survived the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective subjects , this can be quite dark .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his Bible project for which he met a subjective and artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; book of all books &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cycles that are devoted to topics such as cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , commandments or fa@@ therhood .
he immediately fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler Verlag with its emphasis on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting .
he has interpreted the Bibli@@ cal passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and thus translated into current contexts .
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
it is embedded between the original scrip@@ tural quotation of Martin Luther and a set of the artist , which formul@@ ates his personal thoughts to the particular situation here .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant ruler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since education began with the cane &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work up to bring myself back to the Father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to revi@@ ve art in the fast @-@ moving period of time : &quot; the perception of visual worlds is now characterised by advertisements , and that is loud .
symboli@@ sm is super@@ se@@ ded .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewers to &quot; fall into the images &quot; to let them work , discover and sense the power they have : &quot; the image seeks its counterpart . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung &apos;s presentation in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his paintings . &quot;
I have not been careful not to grasp the Bible completely , but have chosen the most important and mysterious subjects for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for Mö@@ h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
plans made , place found , companies commissioned , Erd@@ hü@@ gel opted for a circular course : one year later almost everything was ready - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X Bahn was already finished again .
failures in politics and administration ensured dr@@ y@@ ness , especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the train .
so hills shel@@ tered , new place wanted - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval will go into action in October , as Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now in the inf@@ ant and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should be started without a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further pause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees by 2019 , while the Bundes@@ liga repe@@ ats a clear sign on the weekend .
the football re@@ acts to the escal@@ ating situation in Germany and ensures the policy of its help in dealing with the problems at hand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter to me , I don &apos;t have anything to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be of interest to every individual to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B chief Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he intends to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the Chanc@@ ellery next Wednesday and meet the state minister Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the subject will surely play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football can and may help .
but the decisive course has to set politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association therefore has extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we have ensured that this program will continue until 2019 , &quot; explained Nier@@ s@@ bach on the ver@@ ge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some federal states also support this program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on this weekend the 36 professional associations set a clear sign when they will carry the print &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wir helfen - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of the usual sponsorship company ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s sports director Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes on everyone , nobody must go away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use football , no , we need to use our radi@@ ance , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim CEO Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
on this Friday the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach called the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large community of German football &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 lic@@ en@@ sees had started their own projects in their places is great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this and next year the association will provide 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP CEO lo@@ oses an eye in case of accident
according to several reports , the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , lost the left eye by a fall in early July .
with the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he had fallen to a water glass after midnight , which he had carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was almost blood@@ thir@@ sty , impot@@ ent , then drag@@ ged out on the street - he told us this last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP Co @-@ Fo@@ under Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can pursue his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully work@@ able &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced that he will come back to Germany in October and continue the software group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m full of SAP , full of my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its president , Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such personal history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ one can happen such a thing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up once you have fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except skir@@ mis@@ h ...

football : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar : wil@@ low in the Tor
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of the Europa League have finally broken .
the national player will also be missing the football championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga with the F@@ K K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19@@ .00 / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot resort to it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether Re@@ us will be back to Le@@ verk@@ usen in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel for Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B @-@ Coach opened : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high load of its pro@@ s , Tu@@ chel will not only change its stem 11 on the Re@@ us position .
he also announced a change in the position of the goal keeper .
that is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller occupies the place of stem @-@ keepers Roman bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trains on an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the world champion .
although Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller will be in use in all of the European league games , however , Tu@@ chel was open .
with a high probability he will also contest the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the for@@ bi@@ d@@ ding statement by Mit@@ Players Re@@ us that the final move for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , Mid @-@ field player Julian W@@ eig@@ l considers understandable : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s why Marco is not so wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants to play a pioneering role in Germany
according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer in the transformation of cars .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Autom@@ esse IAA from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new Mobility @-@ Age &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt .
he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who also come together with industry representatives at the IAA .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises , among other things , the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid increase in digital radio communication .
for testing new technology , there is currently a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so that the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks are born &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; review the legal framework and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany wants to use it internationally for example , that the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 km / h .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only envis@@ ages the human being as a driver . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more the passenger .
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on high@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads are expected to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only far to 2020 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authors of the study estimate value creation in the area of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany for 20@@ 25 to around 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the passenger can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD traffic politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly explained .
but the Germans still see self @-@ driving cars scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the For@@ sa Institute commissioned by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the German audit organization Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not count on it until 20 years , 31 percent believe not at all .
in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents expect up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , in the United States 33 percent .
drivers in Germany are not yet ready to completely rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
following a survey of the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control throughout the entire trip on all roads .
on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could be at least 15 percent , in traffic jam 45 per cent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every fourth person would leave the car under no circumstances free of control . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bol@@ l says team@@ - and double @-@ start at table tennis @-@ EM
according to the current state of the title fight , the Düsseldorf @-@ based Düsseldorf legislature wants to open only at the individual from 25 September to 4 October .
the final decision shall fall at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys have experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to clin@@ ch the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ builder Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European apprentic@@ es@@ hips in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that time Bol@@ l was on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsorship program in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo is the down@@ side , we are no longer a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ am@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ elin , who leads the net list in J@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also rec@@ alled the Euro 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then Timo was missing , and we became European leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what we should ori@@ ent ourselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the World Ranking Fi@@ fth . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins , which look sc@@ ary human thanks to video projections .
they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who among others with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits became the big star of the fashion scene - and with that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant terrible of hau@@ te cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it used to be ble@@ ak , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( V@@ om Bürger@@ stei@@ g auf den Lauf@@ ste@@ g ) , which is to be seen at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung on 18 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had already been made in Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the oeu@@ vre of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk , which was used for much effort : to modernis@@ e the dolls , a sty@@ list was used for example .
according to the cur@@ ator , Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot went to Munich for 14 tons of material .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special delic@@ acy : a leather trousers @-@ outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said .
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers of old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first tent@@ ative fashion attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he dressed his ted@@ dy bear and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him .
he later contributed to designing fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them , of course .
for his first own fashion show he did not have to pay the models .
they got nothing , but were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ dry lace as a fashion niche
in the past , it was about the long stit@@ ching machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en about making meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and spi@@ kes were produced in large quantities for customers , which they used for example for blankets and she@@ ers .
this alone is no longer works , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze , fashion plays a major role , was then pushed out by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories like bags and regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which re@@ jects past styli@@ stic periods , is an increasing order potential .
those who do not use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
with us , they are already making half of all jobs .
in cooperation with nine other companies , P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and Sti@@ cker@@ eien .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken away .
private specialist shops and also the wholesale there are almost no more .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
nowadays , mass production is manufactured much cheaper in Asia and is sold almost exclusively by chains .

enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association is also trying to score by environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains from the embroi@@ dery in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have a quality seal that shows that we produce environmentally and socially responsible . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; a field of tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore an existing design is often only slightly varied to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historical snow@@ ball point .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener gold@@ smith masters Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße got inspired by this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I could not start anything with traditional P@@ lau@@ dry lace &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the top of the snow for her jewelry .
in a complex procedure , she shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who would like to remember .
with that I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is not about a new movie but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes 20 years after the first film with the magic child girl . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the global economic crisis in England .

XI aims to open the economy more broad@@ ly for the world
the economy needs to open wider to the outside to promote growth , said President Xi Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group t@@ asked with steering the reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should strive to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Command Group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to promote new spin @-@ offs and promote reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and new place for economic growth , Xi predicted .
the management group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a list of neg@@ atives to regulate market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the local regulatory system .
after the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investments .
the system is tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is important since it as@@ signs the market a greater role in allocation of resources , ensuring a legal business environment and open the market more open , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen inspections on the powers transferred to the companies and ensure companies decide how to conduct their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state controlled sectors , further areas are opened for private investments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process .
the lawyers &apos; right to guarantee their activities , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
the meeting also included Premier Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and key leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as announced in a declaration published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury @-@ limit value in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and to give consumers a significantly higher dose of nerve toxins . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , who has been a corresponding working paper from the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects of missing industrial and environmental policy are passed away with full force to pregnant women and infants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as sh@@ arks and s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish , should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury each kilogram of fish .
however , large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish are already so heavily loaded with mercury , that on the basis of the still valid limit values about 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches may not be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ calcul@@ able .
in return for this loos@@ ening , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU plans to tigh@@ ten the limit values in other fish@@ ings of currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury pro kg .
F@@ ood@@ watch , however , described this as &quot; trick &quot; because smaller Fried@@ fishes , such as car@@ p , are usually so low loaded that they already comply with the planned maximum values .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ h is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de distra@@ ction @-@ manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy @-@ po@@ ison@@ ous heavy metal for the human being , which is heavily enriched in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish over the food chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already small amounts can cause particularly in the case of un@@ born damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry declares on its homepage with regard to the applicable maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health hazard to the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is mainly caused by coal combustion in the environment .
according to a written information from the German Federal Environment Ministry , German coal @-@ fired power plants receive more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total volume em@@ itted in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in fish for example in Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; permanent and nationwide , &quot; had the &quot; Spiegel &quot; quoted from paper in March .
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish have already been among the most commonly reported health risks in the RA@@ S@@ FF EU warning system .
