B ) The organization and the association agree that the securing measures provided in this Agreement will not be applied as long as the core material is used in such an activity .
in the scheme , as far as possible , as long and under what circumstances these security measures are not applied .
in any case , the securing measures en@@ vis@@ aged in this Convention will once again be applied once the core material is re@@ directed to a peaceful nuclear action .
the organization is held on the ongoing basis of the total quantity and composition of the material contained in the respective state or the respective states and on any transfer of such material from this state or these states .
this explains their consent as quickly as possible ; it extends only on matters such as temp@@ oral and proced@@ ural regulations and agreements for reporting , but does not include a approval or a knowledge of the military activity and does not apply to the subsequent use of the nuclear material .
the organisation , the community and the states bear the costs that each of them grows in the execution of their respective obligations under this Convention .
if the association , the states or individuals who are subject to their sovereignty , but extraordinary expenses as a result of a special exploration of the organization , the organisation will reimb@@ urse the costs if it has agreed beforehand .
in any case , the organisation carries the costs of all additional measurements and samples required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization .
the Community and the States guarantee that the liability protection for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , can be used according to their laws and other regulations , to the organization and their officials for the purposes of carrying out this Convention in the same manner as to the nation@@ als of the States .
any claim that the community or a state vis @-@ Ã  @-@ vis the organization or the organization vis @-@ Ã  @-@ vis the Community or a state for damages - with the exception of damage resulting from a nuclear incident - is regulated in accordance with international law .
after verification of the relevant information submitted by the General Director , the Council has not been able to verify that no core material must be subject to securing measures for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive bodies , so he may reimb@@ urse the reports provided in Article XII ( C ) of the Stat@@ utes and if necessary also the other measures stipul@@ ated there .
in such steps , the council takes into account the degree of certainty in which mass has been obtained by applied securing measures , and offers the community or the state - as far as each of the two parties concerned is concerned - any justi@@ fiable opportunity to grant the Council the necessary security .
on request of the organisation , community or state , consult@@ ations take place on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention .
the Community and the States are entitled to request that any questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be examined by the Council .
the Council invites the Community and the affected state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
with the exception of disputes applicable to an establishment of the Council pursuant to Article 19 or any measures taken by the Council are disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention and which are not included in the negoti@@ ation path or other of the organization , the Community and the States , shall submit to an Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal on the request of a party consisting of five arbit@@ rat@@ ors .
the community and the States ren@@ ame two arbit@@ rat@@ ors , the organization also ap@@ points two arbit@@ rat@@ ors , and the four designated arbit@@ rat@@ ors elect a fifth that leads the pres@@ idency .
if the Community and the States or the Organization shall not be appointed two arbit@@ rat@@ ors within three days of the application for an arbitr@@ ator , the association or organisation may request the President of the International Court of Justice to ap@@ point these arbit@@ rat@@ ors .
the same procedure is to apply if within thirty @-@ three days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator the fifth refer@@ ee has not yet been chosen .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal shall be competent and all decisions require the consent of at least three arbit@@ rat@@ ors .
the decisions of the arbit@@ ration court are binding for the organization , the community and the states concerned .
( a ) This Agreement establishes for non @-@ nuclear weapons , the contracting party of the contract and become members of the Community , in force , i ) when the relevant state of the organization noti@@ fies that its procedures for the entry into force of this Convention are completed and
( II ) If the association of the organization noti@@ fies that it is able to apply its security measures with regard to this state for the purposes of this Convention .
a ) The Organization , the Community and the States consult each other at the request of one of the contracting parties to am@@ end this Convention .
B ) All changes require the consent of the Organization , Community and States .
C ) The Director General shall inform all Member States of the organization immediately of any amend@@ ment of this Convention .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement is the agreement and the protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedures applicable to the execution of the provisions of Part I on securing measures such as necessary .
the aim of the procedures set out in this Convention is the timely discovery of the bran@@ ching of significant quantities of nuclear material from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosive devices for unknown purposes , as well as the det@@ err@@ ent of such a devi@@ ation due to the risk of premature discovery .
for the att@@ ainment of the target specified in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , compound with spatial integration and observation as important comple@@ mentary measures .
the technical conclusion of the verification by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which for each material balance zone the amount of material that is not proven for a certain period of time under specification of accuracy limits for the given measurement is performed .
in carrying out their investigations , the organization according to Article 3 makes full use of the safety system of the community .
the accounting and control system of the community for nuclear material according to this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
in the application of its safety measures , the Community will make use of the procedures and measures of the following manner and , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how it is intended and condu@@ ci@@ ve to the supplementary agreements :
a ) a measuring system to determine the quantities of recovered , her@@ edi@@ t@@ ary , lost , lost or otherwise from the stock of removed core material and stock volumes ;
B ) the evaluation of re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and the estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
C ) procedures for determining , testing and evaluating differences in the measurements of sender and recei@@ vers ;
e ) Proced@@ ure to assess accumulation of non @-@ measured hol@@ dings and non @-@ measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and reporting system , which identi@@ fies the core material and changes in this inventory including the one - and outputs of the material balance zone ;
( g ) Re@@ verse measures that ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ure for the reimb@@ urs@@ ement of reports to the organization in line with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures in accordance with this Convention do not extend to material in mining or in the mining industry .
B ) ur@@ anium ( or th@@ orium material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel circuit under letter c ) , is introduced into the States , so the association of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material unless it is not implemented for specifically non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaves core material that is suitable for the composition and purity for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ op@@ en@@ enrich@@ ment , the plant or process phase in which it is manufactured or will be introduced into the states in a later phase of the nuclear fire circulation system , so it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The hed@@ ging measures provided in this Convention are termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not fulfilled , the Community considers that the recovery of nuclear material , which is subject to securing measures according to this Convention , is temporarily not possible or desired , so consult the organization and the Community on the application of suitable hed@@ ging measures .
B ) The hed@@ ging measures provided in this Agreement shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community are in@@ conveni@@ enced by the fact that this core material is practically non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able .
on request of the community , the organization fre@@ es the following core material from the securing measures in accordance with this Convention :
a ) special fis@@ sile material when used in grams - or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) Nu@@ clear material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities after Article 13 , if such a core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ op@@ en@@ concentration of pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 238 , which is over 80 % .
on request of the community , the organisation fre@@ es core material , which would otherwise be subject to securing measures under this Convention , from these security measures , provided that the entire material amount released in the States is not at any point in time than
a ) a total of a kil@@ ogram of particular fol@@ dable material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multi@@ plying his weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with enrich@@ ment , which is below 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above that of Natur@@ ur@@ an , calcul@@ ates by multi@@ plying his weight with the fifth square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0,5 % ) or below ;
if the core material is to be processed or stored together with core material , which is subject to the securing measures under the Convention , processed or stored , precau@@ tions for the re @-@ use of the safety measures are taken on that material .
the community meets with the organization Supp@@ le@@ mentary agreements , which are required for the successful and effective management of the tasks of the organization in accordance with the Convention , in particular determine how the procedures laid down in the Convention are to be adopted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the supplementary agreements can be extended or changed without any amend@@ ments to the agreement in agreement between the organization and the community . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible following the entry into force of this Convention . the Organization , the Community and the States undertake every effort to enter into force within n@@ in@@ ety days following the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states .
the organization , based on the initial report mentioned in Article 62 , constitutes a aggreg@@ ated inventory of the underlying core material in the states , irrespective of its origin , and continues to carry out this inventory as a result of the subsequent reports and the results of their investigations .
between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation )
the E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme stipul@@ ated at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is imp@@ eded by general res@@ sour@@ cent@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ment problems .
C ) It is the E@@ EC and Member States that the entire contribution made by Member States is bound up within six months following entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
d ) E@@ EC and the organization have consul@@ ted one another about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and middle bonds to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
for this purpose , the organisation of the E@@ EC has presented a table which is evident in what way it intends to apply the criteria set out in this agreement -
the organization establishes a special account under the name &quot; Special Account , &quot; which consists of the funds which the Member States have contributed to the special account in accordance with this agreement ; this account is governed by the organization as a st@@ ew@@ ard and used ( in this capacity the organization is referred to as &quot; st@@ ew@@ ard &quot; ) , only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement .
the special account is seg@@ reg@@ ated separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is eff@@ ected in the form of cash or in@@ significant deb@@ tors of the member state to pay on demand in the currency of the respective state to order of the organization as administrator of the special transaction account and to deposit at the deposit of the organization in the country concerned .
B ) Payment shall be made in two rates , and ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or to another between the E@@ EC and the administrator at the agreed time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the rema@@ inder of the contribution for 1 January 1979 or at any other time between the E@@ EC and the administrator , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) E@@ ach Member State may be entitled to make payments in front of the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned dates .
according to the usual procedures of the organization , the st@@ ew@@ ard assumes approximately proportional drawing on the cash or the school@@ er , in order to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and to balance the special transaction account in a reasonable manner .
in the gran@@ ting of these loans , the st@@ ew@@ ard can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the E@@ EC conditions :
III ) to the extent in which international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ e@@ eable economic problems ;
( VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further loan capacity to loan agreements without re@@ ductions ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the respective countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
any special transaction loan serves to finance a clearly outlined and swi@@ f@@ tly ref@@ und@@ able development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , regardless of whether it is part of the organisation &apos;s loan program or not , according to the procedures and practices used for the proper funds of the organization , evaluated , approved and managed , with the aim of the addition to this agreement must be taken into account .
the funds of the special action account may not be used in lieu of a lateral means of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization which is bound by a loan or credit for a program or project , which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement .
apart from Section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same rep@@ ay@@ ment conditions , which are generally valid for the development loans granted by the organization ; thus , they are ref@@ und@@ able in only 50 years .
special transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts for payment of this clock are to be paid directly to the organization that maintains it .
a special loan agreement is indicated by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the car@@ et@@ aker in which the origin of the funds is given .
the recei@@ pts from any transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services ( ii ) in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organization are and which at the time of loan guarantee have been determined , benef@@ ici@@ aries of a special action loan .
capital rep@@ ay@@ ments of special transaction loans take place on the special transaction account , and that amount to be returned in the currency of a member state is returned as soon as possible from the car@@ et@@ aker to the Member State .
the st@@ ew@@ ard will teach the E@@ EC to the full completion of all off@@ ending loan loans through the directors in preparation and on the projects and programs approved by the directors .
during the period of payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator shall inform the E@@ EC quar@@ terly on the development of the special transaction loan and the related expenses .
the administrator transfers the E@@ EC as soon as possible after completion of the business year of the organization with a detailed account statement of the special transaction account with an opinion of the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this account .
after full payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator of the E@@ EC , as soon as possible , transm@@ its a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special editorial account .
the st@@ ew@@ ard creates and performs appropriate records and accounts , from which the contributions to the special transaction account , which are from the account recei@@ pts to financial obligations arising from the account recei@@ v@@ ables and the amounts paid out of the account and the pay@@ outs to the Member States .
the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker are working closely to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
to this end , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker until the full issue of the funds of the special action account from time to time can exchange ideas about the status of the special action account , the progress of the programs or plans , funded by special actions , and on all other questions concerning the provisions of this Agreement .
if the agreement on December 31 , 1978 , or at a later date , which the E@@ EC and the organization may agree not into force , the agreement and all obligations resulting from it are due to immediate effect .
if the total capital amount of all special transaction loans from the recei@@ vers is returned in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all obligations resulting from the parties are termin@@ ated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States are notified to the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Communities the conclusion of the procedure concerned .
the General Secretariat for@@ wards these noti@@ fications with a notification on the regular approval of this agreement by the E@@ EC to the organization .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month , which follows the day of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications in the organization .
this agreement is written in two manus@@ crip@@ ts in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , with all wording equally binding .

I ask you to confirm the consent of the Community to these changes , and propose to you as an appointment for the entry into force of January 1 , 1978 .
I would be grateful if you would confirm the approval of your government on the above .
I honor you to confirm the receipt of your present letter with the following wording :
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would confirm the approval of your government on the above . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the Mobili@@ zation of the demands of the Member States as part of the medium @-@ term financial support
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BIS could close Stand@@ by credit cards with the central banks of credi@@ tor countries if the banks present a corresponding application . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the agreement could be closed up to the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism , namely within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion accounting units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery plans of the member countries .
already now , however , some conditions have been mentioned , for their application the BIS would be ready .
at any stand@@ by credit , the BIS would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of prolong@@ ing extensions , without the fact that a total of five years would be exceeded .
in the opening of the loans as well as on its subsequent extension , the BIS would calculate a loan @-@ opening .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first draw will not be made before the end of a month after the stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liqui@@ dity .
the drawing would take place in the currencies available in the BIS , at the conclusion of the agreement , very likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods that would be taken into account of the funds of the bank , anticipated three or six months .
conditions would correspond to those employed by the BIS at the time under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market rates .
however , if the BIS war@@ ns the necessary means on the market itself , then the interest rate rising to the application could reach a maximum that corresponds to a corresponding margin increased Li@@ bor .
I would be grateful if you would like to tell me the consent of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BIS could close Stand@@ by credit cards with the central banks of credi@@ tor countries if the banks present a corresponding application . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I would be grateful if you would like to tell me the consent of the Council of the European Communities . &quot;

with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand on the trade with Hamm@@ el , lamb and goat meat
I comm@@ end to the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to establish ordin@@ ances on the import of Hamm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the Community in connection with the application of the regulation on a common market organisation for Hamm@@ el , lamb and goat meat .
in recognition of the fact that the sheep economy and the export of Hamm@@ el and lamb meat after the world market and especially after the community for the New Zealand economy is exist@@ ential and that it must be ensured that the normal sales of new ze@@ aland Hamm@@ el - and lamb meat is not com@@ promised in these markets , I comm@@ end to propose the following agreement :
the agreement is valid for : - fresh or cooled Hamm@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ;
according to this agreement , New Zealand is guaranteed for Hamm@@ el , lamb and goat meat access to the market of the Community in the amount specified in the agreement .
new Zealand gets the assurance that the normal sales of his Hamm@@ el and lamb meat is not affected by the application of the regulation .
in order to ensure imp@@ ec@@ cable functioning of the agreement , New Zealand comm@@ its itself to ensure that the amount stated in fact exceeds the amount stated .
the pre @-@ specified quantities are carried out in traditional quotation forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
the community ass@@ ures that New Zealand is not to be prevented with this agreement to use new technological developments or to maintain its competitive position on the market of the Community .
should a change in the supply form be possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties cons@@ enting one another before the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned in Clau@@ se 10 to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the community occupies the protective cl@@ ause , it comm@@ its itself to protect the interests of New Zealand from this agreement .
in the event that imports from New Zealand must exceed the agreed quantities , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from this country .
the community under@@ takes to limit the exhaus@@ tion to imports of the products recorded by this agreement to a Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
in the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with New Zealand changes the quantities set in cl@@ ause 2 according to the scope of New Zealand trade with each new member state .
the import charges for these new Member States are determined in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession ; here the Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ ee of the Ab@@ ility is taken into account in Kl@@ aus@@ el 5 .
the total amount mentioned in cl@@ ause 2 is determined by the day of the Greek accession to the community to 245 500 tons of battle body weight .
the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development that could imp@@ air the normal sales of New Zealand Hamm@@ el and lam@@ bs in the common market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the Community applies precau@@ tions , so that the paragraph of intervention intervals on frozen meat is not under@@ min@@ ed due to the implementation of the Regulation .
in addition , the two contracting parties undertake everything to promote the consumption of creativity in the community without danger to market stability .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agreed that any actual application of equipment or other promotion measures for export@@ ation of Hamm@@ el and lamb meat as well as from the slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs will only be carried out on prices and conditions , which comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of community in world trade with these products .
new Zealand ensures compliance with the quantities mentioned in cl@@ ause 2 in particular that there are no export licenses beyond these amounts .
in turn , the Community comm@@ its itself to make all necessary arrangements to allow the issu@@ ance of import lic@@ ences for the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned products with origin in New Zealand by the submission of a export licence , which is given by the responsible body named by the New Zealand Government .
the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way that a deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import license cannot be wai@@ ved for the requ@@ esting products .

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Ã@@ st@@ lich of Uruguay on the trade with Hamm@@ el and Lamb
I honor the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to establish ordin@@ ances on the import of Hamm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay into the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the Community .
- fresh or cooled Hamm@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( Tari@@ f@@ stelle 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) of the common customs tari@@ ff ) ;
- frozen Hamm@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( Tari@@ f@@ stelle 02.@@ 01 A IV b ) of the Common Cust@@ oms Tari@@ ff ) .
as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for Hamm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay are determined by the following annual quantity :
in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Uruguay under@@ takes to ensure that the amount of the agreed quantity does not exceed the agreed quantity and executed according to traditional quotation forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
should a change in the supply form be possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned under number 10 to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the community occupies the protective cl@@ ause , it comm@@ its itself to bear care that the access to the community market for the communal market is not affected by this agreement .
in the event that the imports from Uruguay in a year exceed the agreed quantities , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Uruguay for the rest of the year .
the community under@@ takes to limit the exhaus@@ tion to the import of products collected by this agreement to a Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
in the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Uruguay will change the amount specified under number 2 according to the scope of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an trade with each new member state .
the import charges for these new member states shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession ; herein , the Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ ee of the Ab@@ ility is taken into account under number 5 .
the total amount mentioned under number 2 is determined by the day of the Greek accession to the community to 5 800 tons of s@@ laugh@@ ter@@ weight .
the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development which could imp@@ air the marketing of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an Hamm@@ el and lam@@ bs on the common market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the Community applies precau@@ tions , so that the paragraph of intervention intervals on frozen meat is not under@@ min@@ ed due to the implementation of the Regulation the Par@@ ag@@ rap@@ h of Lig@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an she@@ ep@@ dog .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agreed that any actual application of equipment or other promotion measures for export@@ ation of Hamm@@ el and lamb meat as well as from the slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs will only be carried out on prices and conditions , which comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of community in world trade with these products .
these terms are in a way compatible with Article XVI of the GAT@@ T and in particular Article 10 ( 2 letters c ) of the Convention on the Interpretation and Application of Articles IV , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Cust@@ oms and Trade Agreement .
Uruguay guarantees compliance with this agreement , in particular , that the quantities of export licenses stipul@@ ated within this agreement are issued for the products mentioned under number 1 .
in turn , the Community comm@@ its itself to make all necessary arrangements for issu@@ ing import lic@@ ences for the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned products with origin in Uruguay from the submission of a export licence , which is issued by the competent authority designated by the ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an administration .
in implementing regulations , the competent ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an authority of the competent authority of the community in regular intervals communicated the quantities for which export licenses have been granted ; these data may be de@@ cryp@@ ted , if necessary , to destination country .
this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand , on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Ã@@ st@@ lich of Uruguay on the other hand .
it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after that time , it remains in force , subject to the right of any party to termin@@ ate it in writing with a period of one year .
in any case , the provisions of this Agreement shall be reviewed by the two parties before 1 April 1984 with regard to changes that are deemed necessary .
I would be grateful if you would confirm the consent of your government with this letter .

the preparations and equipment mentioned in Part II of this protocol must be ster@@ ile , ap@@ y@@ roe and non @-@ toxic .
it is recommended to add the equipment required for inf@@ usion as well as solvents for dry preparations .
human thorou@@ gh@@ bred is the blood ming@@ led with a healthy person and with an appropriate anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant mixed blood .
C ) which are not free from disease transmitted by blood trans@@ f@@ usions , as far as this can be ensured through simple medical examination and medical history .
the blood withdrawal is as@@ ep@@ tic ; the blood is gli@@ ding through a closed , ster@@ ile tube system into a ster@@ ile bottle where the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation solution was introduced before sterili@@ zation .
after termination of the blood withdrawal , the bottle is immediately closed and cooled to a temperature of 4 C to 6 C . afterwards , it must first be opened immediately before using the blood .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation solution cannot be more than 220 ml per litre of human full blood , and the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration may not exceed 97 g per litre .
the blood group according to the A @-@ B @-@ 0 system must be determined before the blood cells and the ser@@ um ; the determination of the R@@ h factor is determined by exam@@ ining the blood cells at a new sample of the don@@ or blood .
as far as for the blood group determination in individual countries standardized or recommended procedures are available , these are applicable .
the term R@@ h @-@ negative is only to be used if specific studies have shown the absence of anti@@ gens C , D , You and E .
the blood exchanged according to this agreement shall only be used for recipients of the corresponding AB @-@ 0 group .
the human thorou@@ gh@@ bred is stored in ster@@ ile , closed bottle from micro@@ organisms and to keep its use at a temperature of 4 to 6 C ; higher temperatures are permissible only during the times necessary for testing and transport , which may amount to at most 30 minutes on which the blood is immediately cooled down to 4 to 6 C .
a concentration of human red blood cells is a unit of human thorou@@ gh@@ bred , from which the majority of the plasma is removed .
it contains all red blood cells of the unit from which it has been obtained ; other blood cell components may be present or may have been partially removed .
the fluid content of the concentrate consists of either the remaining plasma or from a suitable is@@ ot@@ onic artificial wat@@ ering solution , which was added after the removal of the plasma .
the volume of the red blood cells should be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , so the approxim@@ ate percentage of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te volume ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t ) is indicated on the label .
all processes required for manufacturing must take place under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . the filling must be carried out using a ster@@ ile , closed system and only by pressure .

to eliminate the harmful effect of bacterial growth products in plasma , blood donations , the signs of a bacterial infection , are not used ; the ster@@ ility of each donation must be detected in a blood amount of at least 10 ml .
in order to reduce the risk of transmission of idi@@ opath@@ ic h@@ epatitis , det@@ erg@@ ents are to be taken for det@@ erg@@ ents that do not contain more than 12 donations , or to apply other methods which are known to reduce this risk in a comparable way .
one of the liquid quantity of the amount of water used in the production of the plasma is to add a corresponding amount of water ; the substance must be completely dissolved within 10 minutes at 15 to 20 C .
a given quantum of plasma is dissolved in the amount of water which corresponds to the amount of fluid from which it was produced ; the solution is subjected to the following tests :
II ) Is 1 ml solution a sufficient amount of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in or calcium chlori@@ de , so takes place ; the process can be accelerated in the brood oven at 37 C .

solutions from human alb@@ um@@ in and fr@@ actions from human plasma proteins are in ster@@ ile , sealed containers under exclusion of micro@@ organisms . they are protected from light and keep at a temperature of 4 to 6 C .
the label on the container contains all information listed on the respective socket ( Annex 4 ) .
the normal human immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ulin is a plas@@ map@@ rot@@ ein , which is made of human , the anti@@ body of normal adul@@ th@@ ood .
the method used must ensure that the final product does not carry out the conditions described below and does not transfer ins@@ ul@@ atory h@@ epatitis .
furthermore , the manufacturing method must ensure that the antibodies contained in the output product are concentrated in sufficient quantities in the final product .
the method is satisfactory for any final preparation in this regard , if in the initial and final product antibodies for at least one virus and a bacterial tox@@ in are ti@@ pped .
during manufacturing , no anti@@ sep@@ tic or bacterial substance must be added ; in order to ensure the bacterial ster@@ ility and stability of the final product , a suitable preser@@ v@@ ative and a suitable stabili@@ zer can be added to it .
the final product is supplied as a solution whose immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine concentration must be between 100 and 170 g per liter .
II ) The electro@@ phor@@ esis , represented by floating particles below acceptable and suitable conditions , must show that at least 90 % of the proteins possess the flexibility of the g@@ amma component of the glob@@ ul@@ ine of the normal human plasma .
