<seg id="730">The EEC has decided to contribute to the special action programme stipulated at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income, whose development is impeded by general ressourcentransferment problems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) It is the EEC and Member States that the entire contribution made by Member States is bound up within six months following entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans, and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">D) EEC and the organization have consulted one another about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and middle bonds to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">For this purpose, the organisation of the EEC has presented a table which is evident in what way it intends to apply the criteria set out in this agreement -</seg>
<seg id="734">The organization establishes a special account under the name "Special Account," which consists of the funds which the Member States have contributed to the special account in accordance with this agreement; this account is governed by the organization as a steward and used (in this capacity the organization is referred to as "steward"), only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The special account is segregated separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The contributions are to be paid as follows: a) The payment is effected in the form of cash or insignificant debtors of the member state to pay on demand in the currency of the respective state to order of the organization as administrator of the special transaction account and to deposit at the deposit of the organization in the country concerned.</seg>
<seg id="737">B) Payment shall be made in two rates, and (i) the first in the amount of at least 45 v. h. the contribution within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the administrator at the agreed time;</seg>

<seg id="739">C) Each Member State may be entitled to make payments in front of the aforementioned dates.</seg>
<seg id="740">According to the usual procedures of the organization, the steward assumes approximately proportional drawing on the cash or the schooler, in order to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and to balance the special transaction account in a reasonable manner.</seg>
<seg id="741">In the granting of these loans, the steward can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the EEC conditions:</seg>
<seg id="742">III) to the extent in which international economic factors contributed to the country's current and foreseeable economic problems;</seg>
<seg id="743">(VI) the composition and the tendency of the country's debt service and its further loan capacity to loan agreements without reductions; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) the extent to which the problems of the respective countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources.</seg>

<seg id="748">Special transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are refundable in these currencies.</seg>
<seg id="749">Amounts for payment of this clock are to be paid directly to the organization that maintains it.</seg>
<seg id="750">A special loan agreement is indicated by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the caretaker in which the origin of the funds is given.</seg>
<seg id="751">The receipts from any transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services (ii) in a Member State; ii) in developing countries, the members of the organization are and which at the time of loan guarantee have been determined, beneficiaries of a special action loan.</seg>
<seg id="752">Capital repayments of special transaction loans take place on the special transaction account, and that amount to be returned in the currency of a member state is returned as soon as possible from the caretaker to the Member State.</seg>
<seg id="753">The steward will teach the EEC to the full completion of all offending loan loans through the directors in preparation and on the projects and programs approved by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the period of payment of the special transaction loan, the administrator shall inform the EEC quarterly on the development of the special transaction loan and the related expenses.</seg>
<seg id="755">The administrator transfers the EEC as soon as possible after completion of the business year of the organization with a detailed account statement of the special transaction account with an opinion of the external auditor of the organization to this account.</seg>
<seg id="756">After full payment of the special transaction loan, the administrator of the EEC, as soon as possible, transmits a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special editorial account.</seg>
<seg id="757">The steward creates and performs appropriate records and accounts, from which the contributions to the special transaction account, which are from the account receipts to financial obligations arising from the account receivables and the amounts paid out of the account and the payouts to the Member States.</seg>
<seg id="758">The EEC and the caretaker are working closely to achieve the objectives of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="759">To this end, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the caretaker until the full issue of the funds of the special action account from time to time can exchange ideas about the status of the special action account, the progress of the programs or plans, funded by special actions, and on all other questions concerning the provisions of this Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="760">If the agreement on December 31, 1978, or at a later date, which the EEC and the organization may agree not into force, the agreement and all obligations resulting from it are due to immediate effect.</seg>
