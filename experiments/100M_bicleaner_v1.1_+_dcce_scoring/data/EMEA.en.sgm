<seg id="1">It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg orodispersible tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as an oral solution (1 mg/ ml) and as a solution for injection (7.5 mg/ ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">Abilify is used to treat adults with the following mental illnesses: • schizophrenia, a mental illness with a number of symptoms, including disorganised thinking and speech, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not there), suspiciousness and delusions (mistaken beliefs); • bipolar I disorder, a mental illness in which patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormally high mood), alternating with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The solution for injection is used for the rapid control of agitation or disturbed behaviour when taking the medicine by mouth is not appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="8">The solution for injection is only for short-term use and should be replaced by tablets, orodispersible tablets or oral solution as soon as possible: the usual dose is 9.75 mg as a single injection into the upper arm or buttock muscle, but effective doses range between 5.25 and 15 mg.</seg>
<seg id="9">The dose of Abilify should be adjusted in patients who are taking other medicines that are broken down in the same way as Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This disrupts signals transmitted between brain cells by ‘ neurotransmitters’, chemicals that allow nerve cells to communicate with each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole is thought to act mainly by being a ‘ partial agonist ’ for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that aripiprazole acts like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine to activate the receptors, but to a lesser extent than the neurotransmitters.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine are involved in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, aripiprazole helps to normalise the activity of the brain, reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing them from returning.</seg>
<seg id="14">For the treatment of schizophrenia, there were three main short-term studies of Abilify tablets lasting four to six weeks, which involved 1,203 patients and compared Abilify with placebo (a dummy treatment).</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the solution for injection was compared with placebo over a period of two hours in two studies involving 805 patients with schizophrenia or related conditions who were experiencing symptoms of agitation.</seg>
<seg id="16">Another study compared Abilify with haloperidol over 12 weeks in 347 patients, and a further study compared the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo in preventing recurrence in 160 patients whose manic symptoms had already been stabilised using Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify solution for injection was compared with that of lorazepam (another antipsychotic medicine) and of placebo over a period of two hours in one study involving 301 patients with bipolar disorder who were experiencing symptoms of agitation.</seg>
<seg id="18">All of these studies looked at the change in symptoms using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or at the number of patients who responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also carried out studies looking at the absorption of the orodispersible tablets and oral solution by the body.</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies of the solution for injection, patients receiving Abilify at doses of 5.25, 9.75 or 15 mg had a significantly greater reduction in symptoms of agitation than those receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">When used to treat bipolar disorder, Abilify was more effective than placebo at reducing manic symptoms in four of the five short-term studies.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify was also more effective than placebo at preventing manic episodes returning in previously treated patients for up to 74 weeks, and when it was used as an add-on to existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Injections of Abilify at doses of 10 or 15 mg were also more effective than placebo in reducing the symptoms of agitation, and were of similar effectiveness to lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects when taking Abilify by mouth (seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100) are extrapyramidal disorder (uncontrolled twitching or jerking), akathisia (constant urge to move), tremor (shaking), somnolence (sleepiness), sedation (drowsiness), headache, blurred vision, dyspepsia (heartburn), vomiting, nausea (feeling sick), constipation, salivary hypersecretion (increased production of saliva), fatigue (tiredness), restlessness, insomnia (difficulty sleeping) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Abilify’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of schizophrenia and of moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar I disorder, and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment.</seg>
<seg id="26">It also decided that the benefits of the solution for injection outweighed its risks for the rapid control of agitation and disturbed behaviours in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar I disorder, when oral therapy is not appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="27">The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Abilify to Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. on 4 June 2004.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predominantly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Enhanced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">Elderly: the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patients 65 years of age or older has not been established.</seg>
<seg id="33">Owing to the greater sensitivity of this population, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors warrant (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is inherent in psychotic illnesses and mood disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or switch of antipsychotic therapy, including treatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study found that there was no increased risk of suicidality with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease, conditions which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia, and treatment with antihypertensive medications) or hypertension, including accelerated or malignant.</seg>
<seg id="38">Tardive Dyskinesia: in clinical trials of one year or less duration, there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on ABILIFY, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of NMS, or presents with unexplained high fever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all antipsychotic medicinal products, including ABILIFY, must be discontinued.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56-99 years) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, in one of these trials, a fixed-dose trial, there was a significant dose response relationship for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycaemia and Diabetes Mellitus: hyperglycaemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">In clinical trials with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events (including diabetes) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="46">Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY, should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain: weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co- morbidities, use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Given the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS medicinal products with overlapping undesirable effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">A gastric acid blocker, the H2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 (quinidine) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107%, while Cmax was unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers.</seg>
<seg id="53">When considering concomitant administration of ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.</seg>
<seg id="55">Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">When weak inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e. g., diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY, modest increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expected.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies, 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan/ 3-methoxymorphinan ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (omeprazole), and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concerns raised by animal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly justifies the potential risk to the foetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are reasonably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adversely.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following undesirable effects occurred more often (≥ 1/ 100) than placebo, or were identified as possibly medically relevant adverse reactions (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency listed below is defined using the following convention: common (> 1/ 100 ,< 1/10) and uncommon (> 1/1 ,000, < 1/100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - in a long term 52-week controlled trial, aripiprazole-treated patients had an overall-lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 19% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13.1% for placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another long-term 26-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 14.8% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.1% for olanzapine-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 23.5% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 53.3% for haloperidol-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another 12-week trial, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17.6% for those treated with lithium.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7% for placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medically important differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Elevations of CPK (Creatine Phosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0% of patients who received placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Undesirable effects known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, seizure, cerebrovascular adverse events and increased mortality in elderly demented patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and post-marketing experience, accidental or intentional acute overdosage of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,260 mg with no fatalities.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treating an overdose with aripiprazole, haemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins.</seg>
<seg id="74">8 It has been proposed that aripiprazole’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D3, serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D4, serotonin 5HT2c and 5HT7, alpha-1 adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors.</seg>
<seg id="76">Aripiprazole doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-raclopride, a D2/ D3 receptor ligand, to the caudate and putamen detected by positron emission tomography.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients, presenting with positive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled trial, the proportion of responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both groups (aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Actual scores in rating scales used as secondary endpoints, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate, 34% in aripiprazole group and 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In a 26-week, olanzapine-controlled, double-blind, multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain, significantly less patients had at least 7% weight gain over baseline (i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg) on aripiprazole (N= 18, or 13% of evaluable patients), compared to olanzapine (N= 45, or 33% of evaluable patients).</seg>
<seg id="82">In two 3-week, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In one 3-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two 12-week, placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels, the addition of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="87">9 In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 74-week extension, in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization, aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence, primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogenation and hydroxylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealkylation is catalysed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination half-lives for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gender in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.</seg>
<seg id="91">Population pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant race-related differences or effects from smoking upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single-dose study in subjects with varying degrees of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Classes A, B, and C) did not reveal a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with Class C liver cirrhosis, which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to reproduction.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure, indicating that these effects were limited or of no relevance to clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">These included: dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day (3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day (10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose).</seg>
<seg id="97">An additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day (1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose proposed, 30 mg per day, were no more than 6% of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39-week study and are well below (6%) their limits of in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">Developmental toxicity, including dose-dependent delayed foetal ossification and possible teratogenic effects, were observed in rats at doses resulting in subtherapeutic exposures (based on AUC) and in rabbits at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose.</seg>

<seg id="137">It has been proposed that aripiprazole’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonism at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonism of serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="138">In a 26-week, olanzapine-controlled, double-blind, multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain, significantly less patients had at least 7% weight gain over baseline (i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg) on aripiprazole (N = 18, or 13% of evaluable patients), compared to olanzapine (N = 45, or 33% of evaluable patients).</seg>
<seg id="139">In one 3-week, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="140">In a relative bioavailability study comparing the pharmacokinetics of 30 mg aripiprazole as the oral solution to 30 mg aripiprazole tablets in healthy subjects, the solution to the tablet ratio of geometric mean Cmax values was 122% (N = 30).</seg>
<seg id="141">An additional finding was cholelithiasis as a consequence of precipitation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day (1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m2).</seg>

<seg id="143">ABILIFY solution for injection is indicated for the rapid control of agitation and disturbed behaviours in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder, when oral therapy is not appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="144">Treatment with aripiprazole solution for injection should be discontinued as soon as clinically appropriate and the use of oral aripiprazole should be initiated.</seg>
<seg id="145">To enhance absorption and minimise variability, injection into the deltoid or deep within the gluteus maximus muscle, avoiding adipose regions, is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given, on the basis of individual clinical status, which should also include consideration of medicinal products already administered either for maintenance or acute treatment (see section 4.5).</seg>

<seg id="148">The efficacy of aripiprazole solution for injection in patients with agitation and disturbed behaviours has not been established related to conditions other than schizophrenia and manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral benzodiazepine therapy is deemed necessary in addition to aripiprazole solution for injection, patients should be monitored for excessive sedation and for orthostatic hypotension (see section 4.5).</seg>

<seg id="152">Tardive Dyskinesia: in clinical trials of one year or less duration, there were uncommon reports of treatment emergent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmia).</seg>
<seg id="154">Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY, should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia and weakness) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control.</seg>
<seg id="155">96 Weight gain: weight gain is commonly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co- morbidities, use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain, poorly managed life-style, and might lead to severe complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">However, in a single-dose, intramuscular study of aripiprazole (dose 15 mg) in healthy subjects, administered simultaneously with intramuscular lorazepam (dose 2 mg), the intensity of sedation was greater with the combination as compared to that observed with aripiprazole alone.</seg>
<seg id="157">A gastric acid blocker, the H2 antagonist famotidine, reduces aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is deemed not clinically relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In CYP2D6 poor metabolisers, concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.</seg>
<seg id="160">97 Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">However, in a single-dose, intramuscular study of aripiprazole (dose 15 mg) in healthy subjects, administered simultaneously with intramuscular lorazepam (dose 2 mg), the orthostatic hypotension observed was greater with the combination as compared to that observed with lorazepam alone.</seg>

<seg id="167">In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.7% for placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="168">99 Comparisons between aripiprazole and placebo in the proportions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medically important differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Elevations of CPK (Creatine Phosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.0% of patients who received placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">Undesirable effects known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neuroleptic malignant syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, seizure, cerebrovascular adverse events and increased mortality in elderly demented patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">In two short- term (24-hour) placebo-controlled trials involving 554 schizophrenic patients presenting with agitation and disturbed behaviours, aripiprazole solution for injection was associated with statistically significant greater improvements in agitation/ behavioural symptoms compared to placebo and was similar to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In one short-term (24-hour) placebo-controlled trial involving 291 patients with bipolar disorder presenting with agitation and disturbed behaviours, aripiprazole solution for injection was associated with statistically significant greater improvements in agitation/ behavioural symptoms compared to placebo and was similar to the reference arm lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="173">The observed mean improvement from baseline on the PANSS Excitement Component score at the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5.8 for placebo, 9.6 for lorazepam, and 8.7 for aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="174">In subpopulation analyses on patients with mixed episodes or on patients with severe agitation, a similar pattern of efficacy to the overall population was observed but statistical significance could not be established due to a reduced sample size.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,228 schizophrenic patients, presenting with positive or negative symptoms, oral aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled trial, the proportion of responder patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-weeks was similar in both groups (oral aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Actual scores in rating scales used as secondary endpoints, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, oral aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in relapse rate, 34% in oral aripiprazole group and 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In a 26-week, olanzapine-controlled, double-blind, multi-national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary end-point was weight gain, significantly less patients had at least 7% weight gain over baseline (i. e. a gain of at least 5.6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~80.5 kg) on oral aripiprazole (N= 18, or 13% of evaluable patients), compared to oral olanzapine (N= 45, or 33% of evaluable patients).</seg>
<seg id="180">In a 6-week, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, who were partially non-responsive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum levels, the addition of aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy resulted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="181">102 In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 74-week extension, in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization, aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recurrence, primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression.</seg>
<seg id="182">The aripiprazole AUC in the first 2 hours after an intramuscular injection was 90% greater than the AUC after the same dose as a tablet; systemic exposure was generally similar between the 2 formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies in healthy subjects the median times to the peak plasma concentrations were 1 and 3 hours after dosing.</seg>
<seg id="184">Administration of aripiprazole solution for injection was well tolerated and produced no direct target organ toxicity in rats or monkeys after repeated dosing at systemic exposures (AUC) that were 15 and 5 times, respectively, human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose of 30 mg intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="185">In intravenous reproductive toxicity studies, no new safety concerns were observed at maternal exposures up to 15 (rat) and 29 (rabbit) times human exposure at 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Non-clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional oral aripiprazole studies of safety pharmacology, repeat-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to reproduction.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were sufficiently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposure, indicating that these effects were limited or of no relevance to clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">These included: dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and/ or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day (3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/ carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day (10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human dose).</seg>

<seg id="271">In contrast, in patients who had taken other treatments for metastatic breast cancer before, these additional measures showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel-containing medicines.</seg>
<seg id="272">It should also not be used in patients who are breast feeding or who have low levels of neutrophils in the blood before starting treatment.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) noted that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel-containing medicines in patients whose first treatment had stopped working, and that, unlike other paclitaxel-containing medicines, it does not need other medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Abraxane to Abraxis BioScience Limited on 11 January 2008.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for whom standard, anthracycline containing therapy is not indicated (See also section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">Patients who experience severe neutropenia (neutrophil count < 0.50 x 109/ l for a week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during Abraxane therapy should have the dose reduced to 220 mg/ m2 for subsequent courses.</seg>
<seg id="277">For grade 3 sensory neuropathy withhold treatment until resolution to grade 1 or 2, followed by a dose reduction for all subsequent courses.</seg>
<seg id="278">Insufficient data are currently available to recommend dose modifications in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4. and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="279">Studies in patients with impaired renal function have not been performed and insufficient data are currently available to recommend dose modifications in patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="280">Abraxane is not recommended for use in children below age 18 years due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="281">Abraxane is an albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel, which may have substantially different pharmacological properties compared to other formulations of paclitaxel (see sections 5.1 and 5.2)..</seg>
<seg id="282">If hypersensitivity occurs, the medicinal product should be discontinued immediately, symptomatic treatment should be initiated, and that patient should not be rechallenged with paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="283">Patients should not be retreated with subsequent cycles of Abraxane until neutrophils recover to > 1.5 x 109/ l and platelets recover to > 100 x 109/ l.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe hepatic impairment (bilirubin > 5 x ULN or ASL/ ALT > 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="285">While cardiotoxicity unequivocally related to Abraxane has not been demonstrated, cardiac events are not uncommon in the indicated population, especially in patients who have previously received anthracyclines or have underlying cardiac or pulmonary disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">If patients experience nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea following the administration of Abraxane, they may be treated with commonly used anti-emetics and constipating agents.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be used in pregnancy, and in women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception, unless the clinical condition of the mother requires treatment with paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="288">4 Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during and up to 1 month after receiving treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients treated with Abraxane are advised not to father a child during and up to six months after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should seek advice on conservation of sperm prior to treatment because of the possibility of irreversible infertility due to therapy with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane may cause side effects such as tiredness (very common) and dizziness (common) that may affect the ability to drive and use machinery.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and important incidences of adverse reactions related to 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated with 260 mg/ m2 Abraxane once every three weeks in the pivotal phase III clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most notable important haematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients), and was rapidly reversible and dose dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anaemia (Hb < 10 g/ dl) was observed in 46% of patients on Abraxane, and was severe (Hb < 8 g/ dl) in three cases.</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 lists adverse reactions associated with the administration of Abraxane to patients from studies in which Abraxane has been administered as a single agent at any dose in any indication (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100, < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000, < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000, < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Increased blood pressure, increased weight, increased blood lactate dehydrogenase, increased blood creatinine, increased blood glucose, increased blood phosphorus, decreased blood potassium Cardiac disorders:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagia, flatulence, glossodynia, dry mouth, gingival pain, loose stools, oesophagitis, lower abdominal pain, mouth ulceration, oral pain, rectal haemorrhage Renal and urinary disorders:</seg>
<seg id="299">Chest wall pain, muscular weakness, neck pain, groin pain, muscle spasms, musculoskeletal pain, flank pain, limb discomfort, muscle weakness Very common:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on one definitely related case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Because these events have been reported voluntarily during clinical practice, true estimates of frequency cannot be made and a causal relationship to the events has not been established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimicrotubule agent that promotes the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilises microtubules by preventing depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stability results in the inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubule network that is essential for vital interphase and mitotic cellular functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">Albumin is known to mediate endothelial transcytosis of plasma constituents and in vitro studies demonstrated that the presence of albumin enhances transport of paclitaxel across endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is hypothesised that this enhanced transendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60 albumin receptor, and that there is accumulation of paclitaxel in the area of tumour due to the albumin-binding protein SPARC (secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine).</seg>
<seg id="306">Data from 106 patients accrued in two single-arm open-label studies and from 454 patients treated in a randomised Phase III comparative study are available to support the use of Abraxane in metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="307">In one study, Abraxane was administered as a 30-minute infusion at a dose of 175 mg/ m2 to 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="308">The second trial utilised a dose of 300 mg/ m2 as a 30 minute infusion in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multi-centre trial was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer, who were treated every 3 weeks with single-agent paclitaxel, either as solvent-based paclitaxel 175 mg/ m2 given as a 3-hour infusion with premedication to prevent hypersensitivity (N = 225), or as Abraxane 260 mg/ m2 given as a 30 minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">Sixty-four percent of patients had impaired performance status (ECOG 1 or 2) at study entry; 79% had visceral metastases; and 76% had > 3 sites of metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">Fourteen percent of the patients had not received prior chemotherapy; 27% had received chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting only, 40% in the metastatic setting only, and 19% in both metastatic and adjuvant settings.</seg>
<seg id="312">Results for overall response rate and time to disease progression, and progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving > 1st-line therapy, are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxictiy to paclitaxel was evaluated through improvement by one grade for patients experiencing grade 3 peripheral neuropathy at any time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy to resolution to baseline due to cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after > 6 courses of treatment was not evaluated and remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of total paclitaxel following 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane at dose levels of 80 to 375 mg/ m2 were determined in clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="316">The drug exposure (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng. hr/ ml following dosing from 80 to 300 mg/ m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">Following intravenous administration of Abraxane to patients with metastatic breast cancer at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg/ m2, paclitaxel plasma concentrations declined in a multiphasic manner.</seg>
<seg id="318">The mean volume of distribution was 632 l/ m2; the large volume of distribution indicates extensive extravascular distribution and/ or tissue binding of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study in patients with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of paclitaxel following Abraxane administered intravenously at 260 mg/ m2 over 30 minutes were compared with those following 175 mg/ m2 of the solvent-based paclitaxel injection administered over 3 hours.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearance of paclitaxel with Abraxane was larger (43%) than that following a solvent-based paclitaxel injection and its volume of distribution was also higher (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">Based on the published literature, in vitro studies with human liver microsomes and tissue slices show that paclitaxel is metabolised primarily to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel; and to two minor metabolites, 3’ -p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3’ -p-dihydroxypaclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="322">In patients with metastatic breast cancer, after a 30 minute infusion of Abraxane at 260 mg/ m2, the mean value for cumulative urinary excretion of unchanged active substance accounted for 4% of the total administered dose with less than 1% as the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3’ -p-hydroxypaclitaxel, indicating extensive non-renal clearance.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, little information in patients over 75 years is available as only 3 patients over 75 years of age where included in the pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">However, chemical and physical in use stability has been demonstrated for 8 hours at 2°C - 8°C in the original carton, and protected from bright light.</seg>
<seg id="325">Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic anticancer medicinal product and, as with other potentially toxic compounds, caution should be exercised in handling Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="326">Using a sterile syringe, 20 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ ml (0.9%) solution for infusion should slowly be injected into a vial of Abraxane over a minimum of 1 minute.</seg>
<seg id="327">Once the addition is complete, the vial should be allowed to stand for a minimum of 5 minutes to ensure proper wetting of the solid.</seg>
<seg id="328">Then, the vial should gently and slowly be swirled and/ or inverted for at least 2 minutes until complete resuspension of any powder occurs.</seg>

<seg id="357">The Member States shall ensure that prior to launch the MAH provides health care professionals in dialysis centres and retail pharmacies with:</seg>
<seg id="358">• Educational leaflet • Summary of product characteristics (SPC) and Package Leaflet and Labelling • Cool boxes for patients clearly labelled with a visual aid indicating correct use of product.</seg>
<seg id="359">This means that Abseamed is similar to a biological medicine that is already authorised in the European Union (EU) and contains the same active substance (also known as the ‘ reference medicine’).</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood iron levels who could experience complications if they were to receive a blood transfusion, if they do not have the opportunity to donate their own blood before surgery and are expected to lose 900 to 1,800 ml of blood.</seg>
<seg id="361">Treatment with Abseamed must be started under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the management of patients with the conditions that the medicine is used for.</seg>
<seg id="362">For patients with kidney problems and patients who are going to donate their own blood, Abseamed must be injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The dose, the frequency of injection and how long it is used for depend on why Abseamed is being used, and are adjusted according to the patient’ s response.</seg>
<seg id="364">For patients with chronic renal failure or receiving chemotherapy, haemoglobin levels should remain within the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per decilitre in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron levels of all patients should be checked before treatment to make sure that they are not too low, and iron supplements should be used throughout treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy or with kidney problems, anaemia can be caused by a lack of erythropoietin, or by the body not responding enough to the erythropoietin it has naturally.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and help minimise the consequences of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">The epoetin alfa in Abseamed is produced by ‘ recombinant DNA technology’: it is made by a cell that has received a gene (DNA), which makes it able to produce epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed, injected into a vein, was compared with the reference medicine in one main study involving 479 patients with anaemia caused by kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All of the patients had been taking Eprex/ Erypo injected into a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either switched to Abseamed or remained on Eprex/ Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main measure of effectiveness was the change in the levels of haemoglobin between the start of the study and the evaluation period, between weeks 25 and 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study comparing the effects of Abseamed injected under the skin with those of Eprex/ Erypo in 114 cancer patients who were receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study of patients with anaemia caused by kidney problems, patients switching to Abseamed maintained haemoglobin levels to the same extent as those continuing to take Eprex/ Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, those continuing to take Eprex/ Erypo had an increase of 0.063 g/ dl from a starting value of 12.0 g/ dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect with Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which can sometimes lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, stabbing migraine-like headache and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed is not recommended for injection under the skin in the treatment of kidney problems because further studies are needed to make sure that this does not cause allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that, in accordance with EU requirements, Abseamed has been shown to have a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile to Eprex/ Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that makes Abseamed will provide information packs for healthcare workers in all Member States, including information on the safety of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="380">The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the EU for Abseamed to Medice Arzneimittel Pütter GmbH & Co KG on 28 August 2007.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma, and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient's general status (e. g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia at the start of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin (Hb) 10 – 13 g/ dl [6.2 – 8.1 mmol/ l], no iron deficiency), if blood saving procedures are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood (4 or more units of blood for females or 5 or more units for males).</seg>
<seg id="383">Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to allogeneic blood transfusions in adult non-iron deficient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery, having a high perceived risk for transfusion complications.</seg>
<seg id="384">Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml.</seg>
<seg id="385">The haemoglobin concentration aimed for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l), except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="387">A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) over a four week period should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.</seg>
<seg id="389">Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia.</seg>
<seg id="392">The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6 g/ dl or< 3.75 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb > 8 g/dl or> 5 mmol/l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6.8 g/ dl or< 4.25 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb > 6.8 g/dl or> 4.25 mmol/l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route, followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg increments (3 times per week) until the desired goal is achieved (this should be done in steps of at least four weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="396">Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.</seg>
<seg id="398">If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl (0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment, the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week, the haemoglobin has increased ≥ 1 g/ dl (≥ 0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.</seg>
<seg id="401">However, if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued.</seg>
<seg id="402">Mildly anaemic patients (haematocrit of 33 - 39%) requiring predeposit of ≥ 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible, even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous predeposit, in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa, given weekly for three weeks (days 21, 14 and 7) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">In cases where there is a medical need to shorten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks, 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 consecutive days prior to surgery, on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistula needle tubing, followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline to rinse the tubing and ensure satisfactory injection of the product into the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients who develop Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin (see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasia).</seg>
<seg id="408">In the indication “ increasing the yield of autologous blood”: myocardial infarction or stroke in the month preceding treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease.</seg>
<seg id="409">The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe coronary, peripheral arterial, carotid or cerebral vascular disease, including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident.</seg>
<seg id="410">Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients developing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin (1 to 2 g/ dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typical causes of non-response (e. g. iron, folate or, vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium intoxication, infection or inflammation, blood loss and haemolysis) should be investigated.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia (i. e., the reticulocyte “ index”) is low (< 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ microlitre or < 0.5%), platelet and white blood cell counts are normal, and if no other cause of loss of effect has been found, anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examination should be considered for diagnosis of PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">Immunogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for antibody-induced PRCA, i. e. patients with renal anaemia, are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">In patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical trials, an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical trials have not shown significant benefits attributable to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avoid blood transfusion.</seg>

<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically evident ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="419">Based on information available to date, correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of erythropoietin-induced red cells should be taken into account when assessing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate (patient at risk of being transfused).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l)m, the dose adaptation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the participation of the individual patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated, if possible, before the start of epoetin alfa treatment.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylaxis, as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients, especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">Moreover, in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled studies, epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer.</seg>

<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclosporin, blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit rises.</seg>
<seg id="429">No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differentiation or proliferation of tumour biopsy specimens in vitro.</seg>
<seg id="430">Thrombotic/ vascular events, such as myocardial ischaemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accidents (cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarction), transient ischaemic attacks, deep vein thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, aneurysms, retinal thrombosis, and clotting of an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents, including patients receiving epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">11 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents.</seg>
<seg id="433">Independent of erythropoietin treatment, thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotomy.</seg>
<seg id="434">Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is identical in its amino acid and carbohydrate composition to endogenous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients.</seg>
<seg id="435">It could be shown with the aid of cell cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leucopoiesis.</seg>
<seg id="436">12 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies, 389 patients with haematological malignancies (221 multiple myeloma, 144 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 24 other haematological malignancies) and 332 with solid tumours (172 breast, 64 gynaecological, 23 lung, 22 prostate, 21 gastro-intestinal, and 30 other tumour types).</seg>
<seg id="437">In two large, open-label studies, 2697 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included, 1895 with solid tumours (683 breast, 260 lung, 174 gynaecological, 300 gastro-intestinal, and 478 other tumour types) and 802 with haematological malignancies.</seg>
<seg id="438">Survival and tumour progression have been examined in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients, of which four were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and one was an open- label study.</seg>
<seg id="439">In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.</seg>
<seg id="440">These studies have shown an consistent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common cancers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls.</seg>
<seg id="441">Overall survival outcome in the trials could not be statisfactorily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group.</seg>
<seg id="442">There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="443">The extent to which these outcomes might apply to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl, is unclear because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data reviewed.</seg>
<seg id="444">Measurement of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volunteers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients, approximately 5 hours.</seg>
<seg id="445">Following subcutaneous injection, serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection, the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and</seg>
<seg id="446">There is no accumulation: the levels remain the same, whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="447">In some preclinical toxicological studies in dogs and rats, but not in monkeys, epoetin alfa therapy was associated with subclinical bone marrow fibrosis (bone marrow fibrosis is a known complication of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyperparathyroidism or unknown factors.</seg>
<seg id="448">The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a matched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa.).</seg>
<seg id="449">In animal studies, epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight, delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose.</seg>

<seg id="542">Based on information available to date, treatment of anaemia with Abseamed in adult patients with chronic kidney failure (renal insufficiency) who do not yet require dialysis, does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="543">The 2-3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of desired effects should be taken into account when assessing the efficacy of Abseamed.</seg>
<seg id="544">Your doctor will check your levels of the red blood pigment (haemoglobin) regularly and adjust your dose of Abseamed accordingly to minimise the risk of blood clotting (thrombotic events).</seg>
<seg id="545">This risk should be carefully weighted against the benefit to be derived from treatment with epoetin alfa, particularly if you have an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, e. g. if you are obese or have a history of thrombotic vascular events (e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).</seg>
<seg id="546">If you are a cancer patient you should be aware that Abseamed may act as a blood cell growth factor and in some circumstances may have a negative impact on your cancer.</seg>
<seg id="547">If you are due to have major orthopaedic surgery, the cause of anaemia should be established and treated, if possible, before the start of Abseamed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="548">If your levels of the red blood pigment (haemoglobin) are too high you should not receive Abseamed, since you have an increased risk of blood clotting after the surgery.</seg>

<seg id="566">Once a syringe has been removed from the refrigerator and has reached room temperature (up to 25°C) it must either be used within 3 days or disposed of.</seg>
<seg id="567">Aclasta is used for the treatment of the following diseases: • osteoporosis (a disease that makes bones fragile), both in women who have been through the menopause and in men.</seg>
<seg id="568">It is used in patients who are at risk of fracture (bone breaks), including patients who have recently broken their hip in a minor trauma, such as a fall; • Paget’ s disease of the bone, a disease where the normal process of bone growth is changed.</seg>
<seg id="569">In addition, patients with Paget’ s disease should take at least 500 mg calcium twice a day for at least 10 days following treatment, and patients who have broken their hip should receive a large dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 international units) by mouth or by injection into a muscle before their first infusion.</seg>
<seg id="570">Using paracetamol or ibuprofen (anti-inflammation medicines) shortly after Aclasta can reduce symptoms such as fever, muscle pain, flu-like symptoms, joint pain and headache in the three days following the infusion.</seg>
<seg id="571">In the treatment of Paget’ s disease of the bone, Aclasta must only be used by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="572">Because the active substance in Aclasta is the same as the active substance in Zometa, some of the data presented for Zometa were taken into account when assessing Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="573">The first involved almost 8,000 elderly women with osteoporosis, looking at the number of spine and hip fractures over three years.</seg>
<seg id="574">The second involved 2,127 men and women with osteoporosis who were aged over 50 years and had recently broken their hip, and looked at the number of fractures over up to five years.</seg>
<seg id="575">In Paget’ s disease, Aclasta has been studied in a total of 357 patients in two studies, where it was compared with risedronate (another bisphosphonate) over six months.</seg>
<seg id="576">The main measure of effectiveness was whether blood levels of serum alkaline phosphatase (an enzyme involved in the breakdown of bone) returned to normal or fell by at least 75% of the way back to normal levels.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study of elderly women, the risk of spine fractures was reduced by 70% in patients taking Aclasta (without any other medicines for osteoporosis) over three years, compared with those taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="578">There was a 41% risk reduction in hip fractures, when comparing all women taking Aclasta (with or without other osteoporosis medicines) with those taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study of men and women who had broken their hip, 9% of the patients receiving Aclasta had a fracture (92 out of 1,065), compared with 13% of the patients receiving placebo (139 out of 1,062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most side effects with Aclasta tend to occur within the first three days after infusion, becoming less common with repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to zoledronic acid, to other bisphosphonates or to any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients taking Aclasta may also be at risk of kidney problems, reactions at the site of infusion and osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">The company that makes Aclasta will provide educational packs for doctors who prescribe Aclasta for osteoporosis, reminding them how the medicine should be used, and similar packs for patients, which explain the medicine’ s side effects and when they should contact their doctor.</seg>
<seg id="584">The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Aclasta to Novartis Europharm Limited on 15 April 2005.</seg>
<seg id="585">CONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE USE OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT TO BE IMPLEMENTED BY THE MEMBER STATES • CONDITIONS OR RESTRICTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE USE OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT TO BE IMPLEMENTED BY THE MEMBER STATES</seg>
<seg id="586">The Member States shall ensure that the educational programme implemented for the authorised indication of treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis, is extended to the potential prescribers concerned by the new indication: treatment of osteoporosis in post-menopausal women and men at increased risk of fracture, including those with a recent low-trauma hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="587">The patient information pack should be provided and contain the following key messages: • Package leaflet • Contraindication in pregnancy and in breast-feeding women • Need for adequate calcium and vitamin D supplementation, appropriate physical activity, non- smoking and healthy diet • Key signs and symptoms of serious adverse events • When to seek attention from the health care provider</seg>
<seg id="588">Treatment of osteoporosis • in post-menopausal women • in men at increased risk of fracture, including those with a recent low-trauma hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, the recommended dose is a single intravenous infusion of 5 mg Aclasta administered once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a recent low-trauma hip fracture, it is recommended to give the Aclasta infusion two or more weeks after hip fracture repair (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of Paget’ s disease, Aclasta should be prescribed only by physicians with experience in treatment of Paget’ s disease of the bone.</seg>
<seg id="592">After a single treatment with Aclasta in Paget’ s disease, an extended remission period is observed in responding patients (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, in patients with Paget’ s disease, it is strongly advised that adequate supplemental calcium corresponding to at least 500 mg elemental calcium twice daily is ensured for at least 10 days following Aclasta administration (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recent low-trauma hip fracture, a loading dose of 50,000 to 125,000 IU of vitamin D given orally or via the intramuscular route is recommended prior to the first Aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The incidence of post-dose symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of Aclasta can be reduced with the administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly following Aclasta administration.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with renal impairment (see section 4.4) Use of Aclasta in patients with creatinine clearance < 35 ml/ min is not recommended due to limited clinical experience in this population.</seg>
<seg id="597">Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) No dose adjustment is necessary since bioavailability, distribution and elimination were similar in elderly patients and younger subjects.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents Aclasta is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age due to lack of data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 35 ml/ min) due to limited clinical experience in this population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Pre-existing hypocalcaemia must be treated by adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before initiating therapy with Aclasta (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid onset of effect of zoledronic acid on bone turnover, transient hypocalcaemia, sometimes symptomatic, may develop and is usually maximal within the first 10 days after infusion of Aclasta (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, in patients with Paget's disease, it is strongly advised that adequate supplemental calcium corresponding to at least 500 mg elemental calcium twice daily is ensured for at least 10 days following Aclasta administration (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">A dental examination with appropriate preventive dentistry should be considered prior to treatment with bisphosphonates in patients with concomitant risk factors (e. g. cancer, chemotherapy, corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene).</seg>
<seg id="604">For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical judgement of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/ risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The incidence of post-dose symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of Aclasta can be reduced with the administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly following Aclasta administration (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The rate of atrial fibrillation serious adverse events was increased in patients receiving Aclasta (1.3%) (51 out of 3,862) compared with patients receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 out of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In the osteoporosis trials (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]) the pooled atrial fibrillation incidences were comparable between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%).</seg>
<seg id="609">Very common (≥ 1/ 10), common (≥ 1/ 100, < 1/ 10), uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000, < 1/ 100), rare (≥ 1/ 10,000, < 1/ 1,000) adverse drug reactions are shown in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Renal dysfunction Zoledronic acid has been associated with renal dysfunction manifested as deterioration in renal function (i. e. increased serum creatinine) and in rare cases acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">In clinical trials in osteoporosis, the change in creatinine clearance (measured annually prior to dosing) and the incidence of renal failure and impairment was comparable for both the Aclasta and placebo treatment groups over three years.</seg>
<seg id="612">There was a transient increase in serum creatinine observed within 10 days in 1.8% of Aclasta-treated patients versus 0.8% of placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on laboratory assessment, transient asymptomatic calcium levels below the normal reference range (less than 2.10 mmol/ l) occurred in 2.3% of Aclasta-treated patients in a large clinical trial compared to 21% of Aclasta-treated patients in the Paget’ s disease trials.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received adequate supplementation with vitamin D and calcium in the post-menopausal osteoporosis trial, the prevention of clinical fractures after hip fracture trial, and the Paget’ s disease trials (see also section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the trial for the prevention of clinical fractures following a recent hip fracture, vitamin D levels were not routinely measured but the majority of patients received a loading dose of vitamin D prior to Aclasta administration (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions In a large clinical trial, local reactions at the infusion site, such as redness, swelling and/ or pain, were reported (0.7%) following the administration of zoledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="617">6 Osteonecrosis of the jaw Uncommonly, cases of osteonecrosis (primarily of the jaw) have been reported, predominantly in cancer patients treated with bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infection including osteomyelitis, and the majority of the reports refer to cancer patients following tooth extractions or other dental surgeries.</seg>
<seg id="619">In a large clinical trial in 7,736 patients, osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported in one patient treated with Aclasta and one patient treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="620">In the event of overdose leading to clinically significant hypocalcaemia, reversal may be achieved with supplemental oral calcium and/ or an intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical efficacy in the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years were demonstrated in post-menopausal women (7,736 women aged 65– 89 years) with either: a femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD) with a T-score ≤ – 1.5 and at least two mild or one moderate existing vertebral fracture(s); or a femoral neck BMD T-score ≤ – 2.5 with or without evidence of existing vertebral fracture(s).</seg>
<seg id="622">Effect on morphometric vertebral fractures Aclasta significantly decreased the incidence of one or more new vertebral fractures over three years and as early as the one year timepoint (see Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclasta-treated patients aged 75 years and older exhibited a 60% reduction in the risk of vertebral fractures compared to placebo patients (p < 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effect on hip fractures Aclasta demonstrated a consistent effect over 3 years, resulting in a 41% reduction in the risk of hip fractures (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) Aclasta significantly increased BMD at the lumbar spine, hip, and distal radius relative to treatment with placebo at all timepoints (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">Treatment with Aclasta resulted in a 6.7% increase in BMD at the lumbar spine, 6.0% at the total hip, 5.1% at the femoral neck, and 3.2% at the distal radius over 3 years as compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology Bone biopsies were obtained from the iliac crest 1 year after the third annual dose in 152 post- menopausal patients with osteoporosis treated with Aclasta (N=82) or placebo (N=70).</seg>
<seg id="628">8 tomography (μ CT) analysis demonstrated increased trabecular bone volume and preservation of trabecular bone architecture in patients treated with Aclasta compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone turnover markers Bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), serum N-terminal propeptide of type I collagen (P1NP) and serum beta-C-telopeptides (b-CTx) were evaluated in subsets ranging from 517 to 1,246 patients at periodic intervals throughout the study.</seg>
<seg id="630">Treatment with a 5 mg annual dose of Aclasta significantly reduced BSAP by 30% relative to baseline at 12 months which was sustained at 28% below baseline levels at 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below baseline levels at 12 months and was sustained at 52% below baseline levels at 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below baseline levels at 12 months and was sustained at 55% below baseline levels at 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">Vitamin D levels were not routinely measured but a loading dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 IU orally or via the intramuscular route) was given to the majority of patients 2 weeks prior to infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">All cause mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the Aclasta-treated group compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON-RFT study Aclasta treatment significantly increased BMD at the total hip and femoral neck relative to treatment with placebo at all timepoints.</seg>
<seg id="636">Treatment with Aclasta resulted in an increase in BMD of 5.4% at the total hip and 4.3% at the femoral neck over 24 months as compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON-RFT study 508 men were randomised into the study and 185 patients had BMD assessed at 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not powered to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% in men treated with Aclasta versus 8.7% for placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308) an annual infusion of Aclasta was non-inferior to weekly alendronate for the percentage change in lumbar spine BMD at month 24 relative to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy in the treatment of Paget’ s disease of the bone Aclasta was studied in male and female patients aged above 30 years with primarily mild to moderate Paget’ s disease of the bone (median serum alkaline phosphatase level 2.6– 3.0 times the upper limit of the age-specific normal reference range at the time of study entry) confirmed by radiographic evidence.</seg>
<seg id="641">The efficacy of one infusion of 5 mg zoledronic acid versus daily doses of 30 mg risedronate for 2 months was demonstrated in two 6-month comparative trials.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the pooled results, a similar decrease in pain severity and pain interference scores relative to baseline were observed over 6 months for Aclasta and risedronate.</seg>
<seg id="643">10 Patients who were classified as responders at the end of the 6 month core study were eligible to enter an extended follow-up period.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 Aclasta-treated patients and 107 risedronate-treated patients who entered an extended observation study, after a median duration of follow-up of 18 months from time of dosing, 141 Aclasta-treated patients maintained their therapeutic response compared to 71 risedronate-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="645">Single and multiple 5 and 15-minute infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg zoledronic acid in 64 patients yielded the following pharmacokinetic data, which were found to be dose independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After initiation of the zoledronic acid infusion, plasma concentrations of the active substance increased rapidly, achieving their peak at the end of the infusion period, followed by a rapid decline to < 10% of peak after 4 hours and < 1% of peak after 24 hours, with a subsequent prolonged period of very low concentrations not exceeding 0.1% of peak levels.</seg>
<seg id="647">Intravenously administered zoledronic acid is eliminated by a triphasic process: rapid biphasic disappearance from the systemic circulation, with half-lives of t½α 0.24 and t½β 1.87 hours, followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination half-life of t½γ 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early disposition phases (α and β, with t½ values above) presumably represent rapid uptake into bone and excretion via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">Over the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is recovered in the urine, while the remainder is principally bound to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body clearance is 5.04 ± 2.5 l/ h, independent of dose, and unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">Increasing the infusion time from 5 to 15 minutes caused a 30% decrease in zoledronic acid concentration at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve.</seg>
<seg id="652">Since zoledronic acid is not metabolised in humans and the substance was found to have little or no capacity as a direct- acting and/ or irreversible metabolism-dependent inhibitor of P450 enzymes, zoledronic acid is unlikely to reduce the metabolic clearance of substances which are metabolised via the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems.</seg>
<seg id="653">Special populations (see section 4.2) The renal clearance of zoledronic acid was correlated with creatinine clearance, renal clearance representing 75 ± 33% of the creatinine clearance, which showed a mean of 84 ± 29 ml/ min (range 22 to 143 ml/ min) in the 64 patients studied.</seg>
<seg id="654">Small observed increases in AUC(0-24hr), by about 30% to 40% in mild to moderate renal impairment, compared to a patient with normal renal function, and lack of accumulation of drug with multiple doses irrespective of renal function, suggest that dose adjustments of zoledronic acid in mild (Clcr = 50– 80 ml/ min) and moderate renal impairment down to a creatinine clearance of 35 ml/ min are not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="655">As only limited data are available in severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/ min), no dosing recommendations are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-lethal single intravenous dose was 10 mg/ kg body weight in mice and 0.6 mg/ kg in rats.</seg>
<seg id="657">In the single-dose dog infusion studies, 1.0 mg/ kg (6 fold the recommended human therapeutic exposure based on AUC) administered over 15 minutes was well tolerated with no renal effects.</seg>
<seg id="658">Subchronic and chronic toxicity In the intravenous infusion studies, renal tolerability of zoledronic acid was established in rats when given 0.6 mg/ kg as 15-minute infusions at 3-day intervals, six times in total (for a cumulative dose that corresponded to AUC levels about 6 times the human therapeutic exposure) while five 15-minute infusions of 0.25 mg/ kg administered at 2– 3-week intervals (a cumulative dose that corresponded to 7 times the human therapeutic exposure) were well tolerated in dogs.</seg>
<seg id="659">Longer-term repeat administration at cumulative exposures sufficiently exceeding the maximum intended human exposure produced toxicological effects in other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract and liver, and at the site of intravenous administration.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most frequent finding in the repeat-dose studies consisted of increased primary spongiosa in the metaphyses of long bones in growing animals at nearly all doses, a finding that reflected the compound’ s pharmacological antiresorptive activity.</seg>
<seg id="661">Teratogenicity was observed in rats at doses ≥ 0.2 mg/ kg and was manifested by external, visceral and skeletal malformations.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratological or embryo/ foetal effects were observed in rabbits, although maternal toxicity was marked at 0.1 mg/ kg due to decreased serum calcium levels.</seg>
<seg id="663">If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C - 8°C.</seg>

<seg id="671">It belongs to a group of medicines called bisphosphonates and is used to treat osteoporosis in post-menopausal women, osteoporosis in men and Paget’ s disease of the bone.</seg>
<seg id="672">Decreased circulating levels of sex hormones, mainly oestrogens converted from androgens, also play a role in the more gradual bone loss observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">In Paget’ s disease, bone remodelling is too rapid and new bone is formed in a disordered fashion, which makes it weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta works by returning the bone remodelling process to normal, securing formation of normal bone, thus restoring strength to the bone.</seg>
<seg id="675">If you are under dental treatment or will undergo dental surgery, tell your dentist that you are being treated with Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="676">Taking other medicines Please tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.</seg>
<seg id="677">It is especially important for your doctor to know if you are taking any medicines known to be harmful to your kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="678">Using Aclasta with food and drink Make sure you drink enough fluids (at least one or two glasses) before and after the treatment with Aclasta, as directed by your doctor.</seg>

<seg id="683">It is important that you follow this advice carefully so that the level of calcium in your blood does not become too low in the period after the infusion.</seg>
<seg id="684">For Paget’ s disease Aclasta may work for longer than one year, and your doctor will let you know if you need to be treated again.</seg>
<seg id="685">If a dose of Aclasta is missed Contact your doctor or hospital as soon as possible to re-schedule your appointment.</seg>
<seg id="686">Before stopping Aclasta therapy If you are considering stopping Aclasta treatment, please go to your next appointment and discuss this with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="687">Side effects related to the first infusion are very common (occurring in more than 30% of patients) but are less common following subsequent infusions.</seg>
<seg id="688">The majority of the side effects, such as fever and chills, pain in the muscles or joints, and headache, occur within the first three days following the dose of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="689">It is currently unclear whether Aclasta causes this irregular heart rhythm but you should report it to your doctor if you experience such symptoms after you have received Aclasta.</seg>

<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used on its own (monotherapy) in patients (particularly those who are overweight) who cannot use metformin (an antidiabetic medicine). • It can be used together with one other antidiabetic medicine (dual therapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be added to metformin in patients (particularly those who are overweight) who are not satisfactorily controlled on metformin used on its own and at the maximum tolerated dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulphonylurea or insulin, the current sulphonylurea or insulin dose can be continued when starting Actos treatment unless the patient has hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose), when the dose of the sulphonylurea or insulin should be decreased.</seg>

<seg id="754">In triple therapy, the effectiveness of Actos was studied in more than 1,400 patients who were receiving a combination of metformin and a sulphonylurea, to which was added either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">The studies measured the level in the blood of a substance (glycosylated haemoglobin, HbA1c), which gives an indication of how well the blood glucose is controlled.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a decrease in the level of HbA1c, indicating that blood glucose levels had been reduced at doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the triple therapy study, the effect of adding Actos to the existing treatment with metformin and a sulphonylurea was a 0.94% reduction in HbA1c levels, while adding placebo led to a 0.35% reduction.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study examining the combination of Actos and insulin in 289 patients, patients adding Actos to insulin had a 0.69% reduction in HbA1c levels after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in those adding placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects with Actos are visual disturbance, upper respiratory tract infection (colds), weight increase, and hypoaesthesia (decreased sensitivity to a stimulus).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or any of the other ingredients, or in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high levels of ketones [acids] in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">In monotherapy (used on its own), the committee decided that Actos should be an alternative to the standard treatment, metformin, to be used when patients cannot take metformin.</seg>
<seg id="762">The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union, for Actos to Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited on 13 October 2000.</seg>

<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for combination with insulin in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with insufficient glycaemic control on insulin for whom metformin is inappropriate because of contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">There are no data available on the use of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, and therefore its use is not recommended in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="766">When treating patients who have at least one risk factor for development of congestive heart failure (e. g. prior myocardial infarction or symptomatic coronary artery disease), physicians should start with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or oedema particularly those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">There have been cases of cardiac failure reported from the market when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulinor in patients with a history of cardiac failure; patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study of pioglitazone has been performed in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing major macrovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in reports of heart failure, however this did not lead to an increase in mortality in this study.</seg>
<seg id="771">Therapy with pioglitazone should not be initiated in patients with increased baseline liver enzyme levels (ALT > 2.5 X upper limit of normal) or with any other evidence of liver disease.</seg>
<seg id="772">If ALT levels are increased to 3 X upper limit of normal during pioglitazone therapy, liver enzyme levels should be reassessed as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If any patient develops symptoms suggesting hepatic dysfunction, which may include unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia and/ or dark urine, liver enzymes should be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether to continue the patient on therapy with pioglitazone should be guided by clinical judgement pending laboratory evaluations.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with pioglitazone there was evidence of dose related weight gain, which may be due to fat accumulation and in some cases associated with fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">There was a small reduction in mean haemoglobin (4% relative reduction) and haematocrit (4.1% relative reduction) during therapy with pioglitazone, consistent with haemodilution.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were seen in metformin (haemoglobin 3 - 4% and haematocrit 3.6 – 4.1% relative reductions) and to a lesser extent sulphonylurea and insulin (haemoglobin 1 – 2% and haematocrit 1 – 3.2% relative reductions) treated patients in comparative controlled trials with pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="778">As a consequence of increased insulin sensitivity, patients receiving pioglitazone in dual or triple oral therapy with a sulphonylurea or in dual therapy with insulin may be at risk for dose-related hypoglycaemia, and a reduction in the dose of the sulphonylurea or insulin may be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="779">Post-marketing reports of new-onset or worsening diabetic macular oedema with decreased visual acuity have been reported with thiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether or not there is a direct association between pioglitazone and macular oedema but prescribers should be alert to the possibility of macular oedema if patients report disturbances in visual acuity; an appropriate ophthalmological referral should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">An increased incidence in bone fractures in women was seen in a pooled analysis of adverse event reports of bone fracture from randomised, controlled, double blind clinical trials in over 8100 pioglitazone and 7400 comparator treated patients, on treatment for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="782">4 The fracture incidence calculated was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparator.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the 3.5 year cardiovascular risk PROactive study, 44/ 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of pioglitazone-treated female patients experienced fractures compared to 23/ 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) of female patients treated with comparator.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the risk of pregnancy and if a patient wishes to become pregnant or if pregnancy occurs, the treatment should be discontinued (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Interaction studies have shown that pioglitazone has no relevant effect on either the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with substances metabolised by these enzymes, e. g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporin, calcium channel blockers, and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">Co-administration of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C8) is reported to result in a 3-fold increase in AUC of pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="788">Co- administration of pioglitazone with rifampicin (an inducer of cytochrome P450 2C8) is reported to result in a 54% decrease in AUC of pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="789">This was attributable to the action of pioglitazone in diminishing the maternal hyperinsulinaemia and increased insulin resistance that occurs during pregnancy thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for foetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Frequencies are defined as: very common > 1/ 10; common > 1/ 100 ,< 1/10; uncommon > 1/1000 ,< 1/100; rare > 1/ 10000 ,< 1/1000; very rare < 1/10000; not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).</seg>
<seg id="791">Visual disturbance has been reported mainly early in treatment and is related to changes in blood glucose due to temporary alteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens as seen with other hypoglycaemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with pioglitazone the incidence of elevations of ALT greater than three times the upper limit of normal was equal to placebo but less than that seen in metformin or sulphonylurea comparator groups.</seg>
<seg id="793">In controlled clinical trials the incidence of reports of heart failure with pioglitazone treatment was the same as in placebo, metformin and sulphonylurea treatment groups, but was increased when used in combination therapy with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="794">Heart failure has been reported rarely with marketing use of pioglitazone, but more frequently when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with a history of cardiac failure.</seg>
<seg id="795">A pooled analysis was conducted of adverse event reports of bone fractures from randomised, comparator controlled, double blind clinical trials in over 8100 patients in the pioglitazone-treated groups and 7400 in the comparator-treated groups of up to 3.5 years duration.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the 3.5 year PROactive study, 44/ 870 (5.1%) of pioglitazone-treated female patients experienced fractures compared to 23/ 905 (2.5%) of female patients treated with comparator.</seg>
<seg id="797">The maximum reported dose of 120 mg/ day for four days, then 180 mg/ day for seven days was not associated with any symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone appears to act via activation of specific nuclear receptors (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma) leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in animals.</seg>
<seg id="799">Treatment with pioglitazone has been shown to reduce hepatic glucose output and to increase peripheral glucose disposal in the case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical trial of pioglitazone vs. gliclazide as monotherapy was extended to two years in order to assess time to treatment failure (defined as appearance of HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first six months of therapy).</seg>
<seg id="801">At two years, glycaemic control (defined as HbA1c < 8.0%) was sustained in 69% of patients treated with pioglitazone, compared with 50% of patients on gliclazide.</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo controlled trial, patients with inadequate glycaemic control despite a three month insulin optimisation period were randomised to pioglitazone or placebo for 12 months.</seg>
<seg id="803">Patients receiving pioglitazone had a mean reduction in HbA1c of 0.45% compared with those continuing on insulin alone, and a reduction of insulin dose in the pioglitazone treated group.</seg>
<seg id="804">In one year clinical trials, pioglitazone consistently gave a statistically significant reduction in the albumin/ creatinine ratio compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazone (45 mg monotherapy vs. placebo) was studied in a small 18-week trial in type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, reduced total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids, and increased HDL-cholesterol levels were observed as compared to placebo, with small, but not clinically significant increases in LDL-cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials of up to two years duration, pioglitazone reduced total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids, and increased HDL cholesterol levels, compared with placebo, metformin or gliclazide.</seg>
<seg id="808">Pioglitazone did not cause statistically significant increases in LDL cholesterol levels compared with placebo, whilst reductions were observed with metformin and gliclazide.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a 20-week study, as well as reducing fasting triglycerides, pioglitazone reduced post prandial hypertriglyceridaemia through an effect on both absorbed and hepatically synthesised triglycerides.</seg>
<seg id="810">In PROactive, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing major macrovascular disease were randomised to pioglitazone or placebo in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy, for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">Following oral administration, pioglitazone is rapidly absorbed, and peak plasma concentrations of unchanged pioglitazone are usually achieved 2 hours after administration.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis M-IV contribution to efficacy is approximately three-fold that of pioglitazone, whilst the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">Interaction studies have shown that pioglitazone has no relevant effect on either the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">Concomitant administration of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C8) or with rifampicin (an inducer of cytochrome P450 2C8) is reported to increase or decrease, respectively, the plasma concentration of pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">Following oral administration of radiolabelled pioglitazone to man, recovered label was mainly in faeces (55%) and a lesser amount in urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma elimination half-life of unchanged pioglitazone in man is 5 to 6 hours and for its total active metabolites 16 to 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">In patients with renal impairment, plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower than those seen in subjects with normal renal function, but oral clearance of parent substance is similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicology studies, plasma volume expansion with haemodilution, anaemia, and reversible eccentric cardiac hypertrophy was consistently apparent after repeated dosing of mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="819">This was attributable to the action of pioglitazone in diminishing the maternal hyperinsulinaemia and increased insulin resistance that occurs during pregnancy thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for foetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">An increased incidence of hyperplasia (males and females) and tumours (males) of the urinary bladder epithelium was apparent in rats treated with pioglitazone for up to 2 years.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), treatment with two other thiazolidinediones increased tumour multiplicity in the colon.</seg>

<seg id="823">The fracture incidence calculated was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparator.</seg>
<seg id="824">16 In the 3.5 year cardiovascular risk PROactive study, 44/ 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of pioglitazone-treated female patients experienced fractures compared to 23/ 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) of female patients treated with comparator.</seg>
<seg id="825">In a two-year study of combination therapy comparing pioglitazone with gliclazide when added to metformin, glycaemic control measured as mean change from baseline in HbA1c was similar between treatment groups after one year.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actraphane has been studied in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes, when the pancreas cannot produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes, when the body is unable to use insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="865">The study measured after 12 weeks the level of a substance (glycosylated haemoglobin, HbA1c), which gives an indication of how well the blood glucose is controlled.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane led to a decrease in the level of HbA1c, indicating that blood sugar levels had been controlled to a similar level to that seen with other human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin human (rDNA) or to any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="868">Actraphane doses might also need to be adjusted when given with a number of other medicines which may have an effect on blood sugar (the full list is available in the Package Leaflet).</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Actraphane’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="870">The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union, for Actraphane to Novo Nordisk A/ S on 7 October 2002.</seg>
<seg id="871">Premixed insulin products are usually given once or twice daily when a rapid initial effect together with a more prolonged effect is desired.</seg>
<seg id="872">The needle should be kept under the skin for at least 6 seconds to make sure the entire dose is injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood glucose control is greatly improved e. g. by intensified insulin therapy, may experience a change in their usual warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (fast-, dual-, long-acting insulin etc.), origin (animal, human or analogue insulin) and/ or method of manufacture (recombinant DNA versus animal source insulin) may result in a need for a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="875">If an adjustment is needed when switching the patients to Actraphane, it may occur with the first dose or during the first several weeks or months.</seg>
<seg id="876">3 A few patients who have experienced hypoglycaemic reactions after transfer from animal source insulin have reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from those experienced with their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Before travelling between different time zones, the patient should be advised to consult the physician, since this may mean that the patient has to take insulin and meals at different times.</seg>
<seg id="878">The physician must therefore take possible interactions into account and should always ask his patients about any medicinal products they take.</seg>
<seg id="879">Both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia, which can occur in inadequately controlled diabetes therapy, increase the risk of malformations and death in utero.</seg>
<seg id="880">Severe hypoglycaemia may lead to unconsciousness and/ or convulsions and may result in temporary or permanent impairment of brain function or even death.</seg>
<seg id="881">Nervous system disorders Uncommon - Peripheral neuropathy Fast improvement in blood glucose control may be associated with a condition termed “ acute painful neuropathy”, which is usually reversible.</seg>
<seg id="882">However, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy.</seg>
<seg id="883">Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Uncommon - Lipodystrophy Lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site as a consequence of failure to rotate injection sites within an area.</seg>
<seg id="884">General disorders and administration site conditions Uncommon - Injection site reactions Injection site reactions (redness, swelling, itching, pain and haematoma at the injection site) may occur during treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="885">Immune system disorders Uncommon - Urticaria, rash Very rare - Anaphylactic reactions Symptoms of generalised hypersensitivity may include generalised skin rash, itching, sweating, gastrointestinal upset, angioneurotic oedema, difficulties in breathing, palpitation, reduction in blood pressure and fainting/ loss of consciousness.</seg>
<seg id="886">However, hypoglycaemia may develop over sequential stages: • Mild hypoglycaemic episodes can be treated by oral administration of glucose or sugary products.</seg>
<seg id="887">It is therefore recommended that the diabetic patients carry some sugar lumps, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juice. • Severe hypoglycaemic episodes, where the patient has become unconscious, can be treated by glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received appropriate instruction, or by glucose given intravenously by a medical professional.</seg>
<seg id="888">Onset of action is within ½ hour, reaches a maximum effect within 2-8 hours and the entire duration of action is up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Absorption The absorption profile is due to the product being a mixture of insulin products with fast and protracted absorption respectively.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of cleavage (hydrolysis) sites on the human insulin molecule have been proposed; none of the metabolites formed following the cleavage are active.</seg>
<seg id="891">Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction.</seg>
<seg id="892">7 After removing Actraphane vial from the refrigerator it is recommended to allow the vial to reach room temperature (not above 25°C) before resuspending the insulin as instructed for first time use.</seg>

<seg id="896">However, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy.</seg>
<seg id="897">The terminal half-life (t½) is therefore a measure of the absorption rather than of the elimination per se of insulin from plasma (insulin in the blood stream has a t½ of a few minutes).</seg>

<seg id="1020">What Actraphane looks like and contents of the pack The suspension for injection comes as a cloudy, white, aqueous suspension.</seg>
<seg id="1021">Before every injection: • Check there are at least 12 units of insulin left in the cartridge to allow even resuspending.</seg>
<seg id="1022">To avoid injection of air and ensure proper dosing: • Hold Actraphane 10 NovoLet with the needle pointing upwards • Tap the cartridge gently with your finger a few times.</seg>
<seg id="1023">Any air bubbles will collect at the top of the cartridge • Keeping the needle upwards, turn the cartridge for one click in the direction of the arrow (picture C) • Still with the needle upwards, press the push-button fully down (picture D) • A drop of insulin must appear at the needle tip.</seg>
<seg id="1024">• Put the cap back on the pen, with 0 next to the dosage indicator (picture E) • Check that the push-button is fully down.</seg>
<seg id="1025">If it isn’ t, turn the cap until the push-button is fully depressed • Hold your Actraphane 10 NovoLet horizontally.</seg>
<seg id="1026">If the push-button cannot rise freely, some of your insulin will be pushed out of the needle • The scale on the cap shows 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 and 18 units.</seg>
<seg id="1027">The push-button also rises as you turn the cap • The scale under the push-button shows 20, 40 and 60 units.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To check a dose you set • Note the figure on the cap next to the dosage indicator • Note the highest figure you can see on the push-button scale • Add the two together to show the dose you set • If you have set a wrong dose, simply turn the cap forwards or backwards until you set the right number of units.</seg>
<seg id="1029">Otherwise, insulin will leak out of the needle and the dose will be incorrect • If you have, by mistake, tried to set a dose over 78 units, follow these steps:</seg>
<seg id="1030">Then take the cap off and put it back on again, lining up the 0 next to the dosage indicator.</seg>
<seg id="1031">Be careful only to push the push- button when injecting • Keep the push-button fully depressed after the injection until the needle has been withdrawn from the skin.</seg>
<seg id="1032">If not, turn the cap until the push- button is fully depressed, then proceed as described in Getting started • You may hear a clicking sound when you press the push-button.</seg>
<seg id="1033">Don’ t use this to set or check your dose; it may not be accurate • You can’ t set a dose higher than the number of units left in the cartridge • You can use the insulin level indicator to estimate how much is left, but you can’ t use it to set or select your dose.</seg>

<seg id="1167">Adenuric is used in patients who already have signs of a build-up of crystals, including arthritis (pain and inflammation in the joints) or tophi (‘ stones ’, larger deposits of urate crystals that can cause joint and bone damage).</seg>
<seg id="1168">Adenuric usually reduces blood uric acid levels within two weeks, but the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day if blood uric acid levels remain above 6 mg per decilitre after two to four weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1169">Attacks of gout can still occur during the first few months of treatment, so it is recommended that patients take other medicines to prevent attacks of gout for at least the first six months of treatment with Adenuric.</seg>
<seg id="1170">It is not recommended for use in children or in patients who have had an organ transplant because it has not been studied in these groups.</seg>
<seg id="1171">The first study, carried out in 1,072 patients, compared the effectiveness of three doses of Adenuric (80, 120 and 240 mg once a day) with that of placebo (a dummy treatment) and of allopurinol (another medicine used to treat hyperuricaemia).</seg>
<seg id="1172">The second study compared two doses of Adenuric (80 and 120 mg once a day) with allopurinol over one year in 762 patients.</seg>
<seg id="1173">In both studies, allopurinol was used at a dose of 300 mg once a day, except for patients with kidney problems, who took 100 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1174">The main measure of effectiveness was the number of patients whose final three blood uric acid levels were below 6 mg/ dl.</seg>
<seg id="1175">In the first study, 48% of the patients taking 80 mg Adenuric once a day (126 out of 262) and 65% of the patients taking 120 mg once a day (175 out of 269) had levels of uric acid below 6 mg/ dl in the final three measurements.</seg>
<seg id="1176">This was compared with 22% of the patients taking allopurinol (60 out of 268) and none of the 134 patients taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1177">The most common side effects with Adenuric (seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100) are headache, diarrhoea, nausea (feeling sick), rash and abnormal liver test results.</seg>
<seg id="1178">There may also be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels, particularly in patients with a history of heart problems.</seg>
<seg id="1179">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Adenuric was more effective than allopurinol at lowering blood uric acid levels, but that it could carry a greater risk of side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1180">Treatment of chronic hyperuricaemia in conditions where urate deposition has already occurred (including a history, or presence of, tophus and/ or gouty arthritis).</seg>
<seg id="1181">If serum uric acid is > 6 mg/ dl (357 µmol/ l) after 2-4 weeks, ADENURIC 120 mg once daily may be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1182">The efficacy and safety have not been fully evaluated in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/ min, see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1183">Children and adolescents As there has been no experience in children and adolescents, the use of febuxostat in such patients is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Organ transplant recipients As there has been no experience in organ transplant recipients, the use of febuxostat in such patients is not recommended (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1185">Cardio-vascular disorders Treatment with febuxostat in patients with ischaemic heart disease or congestive heart failure is not recommended (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1186">As with other urate lowering medicinal products, gout flares may occur during initiation of treatment due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits.</seg>
<seg id="1187">Xanthine deposition As with other urate lowering medicinal products, in patients in whom the rate of urate formation is greatly increased (e. g. malignant disease and its treatment, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome) the absolute concentration of xanthine in urine could, in rare cases, rise sufficiently to allow deposition in the urinary tract.</seg>
<seg id="1188">3 Liver disorders During the phase 3 clinical studies, mild liver function test abnormalities were observed in patients treated with febuxostat (3.5%).</seg>
<seg id="1189">Liver function test is recommended prior to the initiation of therapy with febuxostat and periodically thereafter based on clinical judgement (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1190">Theophylline Although interaction studies have not been performed with febuxostat, inhibition of XO may cause an increase in the theophylline level (inhibition of the metabolism of theophylline has been reported with other XO inhibitors).</seg>
<seg id="1191">In healthy subjects concomitant use of febuxostat and naproxen 250mg BID was associated with an increase in febuxostat exposure (Cmax 28%, AUC 41% and t1/ 2 26%).</seg>
<seg id="1192">In clinical studies the use of naproxen or other NSAIDs/ Cox-2 inhibitors was not related to any clinically significant increase in adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1193">4 Colchicine/ indometacin/ hydrochlorothiazide/ warfarin Febuxostat can be co-administered with colchicine or indomethacin with no dose adjustment of febuxostat or the co-administered active substance being necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1194">In a study in healthy subjects, 120 mg ADENURIC QD resulted in a mean 22% increase in AUC of desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate indicating a potential weak inhibitory effect of febuxostat on the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Antacids Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide has been shown to delay absorption of febuxostat (approximately 1 hour) and to cause a 32% decrease in Cmax, but no significant change in AUC was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Pregnancy Data on a very limited number of exposed pregnancies have not indicated any adverse effects of febuxostat on pregnancy or on the health of the foetus/ new born child.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development or parturition (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="1198">Patients should exercise caution before driving, using machinery or participating in dangerous activities until they are reasonably certain that ADENURIC does not adversely affect performance.</seg>
<seg id="1199">A numerically greater incidence of investigator-reported cardiovascular events was observed in the febuxostat total group compared to the allopurinol group in the pivotal Phase III (1.3 vs 0.3 events per 100 PYs) and long-term extension studies (1.4 vs 0.7 events per 100 PYs), although no statistically significant differences were found and no causal relationship with febuxostat was established.</seg>
<seg id="1200">Identified risk factors among these patients were a medical history of atherosclerotic disease and/ or myocardial infarction, or of congestive heart failure.</seg>
<seg id="1201">Common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10), uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100) and rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1000) adverse reactions suspected (investigator assessment) to be drug related occurring in the 80 mg/ 120 mg treatment groups and reported more than once in the total febuxostat treatment group are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="1202">7 * Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting are more frequent in patients concomitantly treated with colchicine ** No serious rashes or severe hypersensitivity reactions were noted in the clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Long-term open label extension studies In the long-term open label extension studies, the number of patients treated with febuxostat 80 mg/ 120 mg up to 1 year was 906, up to 2 years was 322, up to 3 years was 57, and up 4 years was 53.</seg>
<seg id="1204">The treatment-related events reported during the long-term extension studies were similar to those reported in the Phase 3 studies (see Table 1).</seg>
<seg id="1205">The following treatment-related events were reported more than once in the total febuxostat treatment group and were reported as uncommon in subjects taking febuxostat 80 mg/ 120 mg in long-term extension studies (up to 4 years, > 1,900 Patient-years of exposure).</seg>
<seg id="1206">These treatment-related events were either not reported or reported at a lower frequency for these doses, in the pivotal Phase 3 studies:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, insomnia, hypoaesthesia, ECG abnormal, cough, dyspnoea, skin discolouration, skin lesion, bursitis, proteinuria, renal insufficiency, erectile dysfunction, blood potassium increase, blood TSH increase, lymphocyte count decreased, WBC decrease.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Mechanism of action Uric acid is the end product of purine metabolism in humans and is generated in the cascade of hypoxanthine → xanthine → uric acid.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Febuxostat is a potent, non-purine selective inhibitor of XO (NP-SIXO) with an in vitro inhibition Ki value less than one nanomolar.</seg>
<seg id="1210">Clinical studies results The efficacy of ADENURIC was demonstrated in two Phase 3 pivotal studies (APEX study and FACT study described below) that were conducted in 1832 patients with hyperuricemia and gout.</seg>
<seg id="1211">8 in each study was the proportion of patients whose last 3 monthly serum uric acid levels were < 6.0 mg/ dl (357 µmol/ l).</seg>
<seg id="1212">One thousand and seventy-two (1072) patients were randomized: placebo (n=134), ADENURIC 80 mg QD (n=267), ADENURIC 120 mg QD (n=269), ADENURIC 240 mg QD (n=134) or allopurinol (300 mg QD [n=258] for patients with a baseline serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/ dl or 100 mg QD [n=10] for patients with a baseline serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/ dl and ≤ 2.0 mg/ dl).</seg>
<seg id="1213">The APEX study showed statistically significant superiority of both the ADENURIC 80 mg QD and the ADENURIC 120 mg QD treatment arms versus the conventionnally used doses of allopurinol 300mg (n = 258) / 100mg (n = 10) treatment arm in reducing the sUA below 6 mg/ dl (357 µmol/ l) (see Table 2 and Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="1214">The FACT study showed the statistically significant superiority of both ADENURIC 80 mg and ADENURIC 120 mg QD treatment arms versus the conventionally used dose of allopurinol 300 mg treatment arm in reducing and maintaining sUA below 6 mg/ dl (357 µmol/ l).</seg>
<seg id="1215">results from subjects receiving either 100 mg QD (n=10: patients with serum creatinine > 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg/ dl) or 300 mg QD (n=509) were pooled for analyses. * p < 0.001 vs allopurinol, # p < 0.001 vs 80 mg</seg>
<seg id="1216">Reduction in serum uric acid level to < 6.0 mg/ dl (357 µmol/ l) was noted by the Week 2 visit and was maintained throughout treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1217">509 patients received allopurinol 300 mg QD; 10 patients with serum creatinine > 1.5 and < 2.0 mg/ dl were dosed with 100 mg QD.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Primary endpoint in the sub-group of patients with renal impairment The APEX Study evaluated efficacy in 40 patients with renal impairment (i. e., baseline serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/ dl and < =2.0 mg/ dl).</seg>
<seg id="1219">ADENURIC achieved the primary efficacy endpoint in 44% (80 mgQD), 45% (120 mg QD), and 60% (240 mg QD) of patients compared to 0% in the allopurinol 100 mg QD and placebo groups.</seg>
<seg id="1220">There were no clinically significant differences in the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration in healthy subjects irrespective of their renal function (58% in the normal renal function group and 55% in the severe renal dysfunction group).</seg>
<seg id="1221">Primary endpoint in the sub group of patients with sUA ≥ 10 mg/ dl Approximately 40% of patients (combined APEX and FACT) had a baseline sUA of ≥ 10 mg/ dl.</seg>
<seg id="1222">10 Two years of data from the Phase 3 Open Label Extension study showed that the maintenance of serum urate levels < 6 mg/ dl (< 357 µmol/ l) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of gout flares with less than 3% of subjects requiring treatment for a flare (i. e. more than 97% of patients did not require treatment for a flare) at Month 16-24.</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction of tophus size leading to complete resolution in 54% of subjects at Month 24.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Increased TSH values (> 5.5 µIU/ ml) were observed in patients on long-term treatment with febuxostat (5.0%) and patients with allopurinol (5.8%) in the long term open label extension studies (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy subjects, maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of febuxostat increased in a dose proportional manner following single and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For doses between 120 mg and 300 mg, a greater than dose proportional increase in AUC is observed for febuxostat.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After single or multiple oral 80 and 120 mg once daily doses, Cmax is approximately 2.8-3.2 µg/ ml, and 5.0- 5.3 µg/ ml, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="1228">However, no clinically significant change in the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was observed where tested (80 mg multiple dose).</seg>
<seg id="1229">Distribution The apparent steady state volume of distribution (Vss/ F) of febuxostat ranges from 29 to 75 l after oral doses of 10-300 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The plasma protein binding of febuxostat is approximately 99.2%, (primarily to albumin), and is constant over the concentration range achieved with 80 and 120 mg doses.</seg>
<seg id="1231">In vitro studies with human liver microsomes showed that those oxidative metabolites were formed primarily by CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C8 or CYP2C9 and febuxostat glucuronide was formed mainly by UGT 1A1, 1A8, and 1A9</seg>
<seg id="1232">Following an 80 mg oral dose of 14 C-labeled febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged febuxostat (3%), the acyl glucuronide of the active substance (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%), and other unknown metabolites (3%).</seg>
<seg id="1233">In addition to the urinary excretion, approximately 45% of the dose was recovered in the faeces as the unchanged febuxostat (12%), the acyl glucuronide of the active substance (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%), and other unknown metabolites (7%).</seg>
<seg id="1234">Special populations Renal insufficiency Following multiple doses of 80 mg of ADENURIC in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal insufficiency, the Cmax of febuxostat did not change, relative to subjects with normal renal function.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The mean total AUC of febuxostat increased by approximately 1.8-fold from 7.5 μ g⋅ h/ ml in the normal renal function group to 13.2 μ g. h/ ml in the severe renal dysfunction group.</seg>
<seg id="1236">Hepatic impairment Following multiple doses of 80 mg of ADENURIC in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, the Cmax and AUC of febuxostat and its metabolites did not change significantly compared to subjects with normal hepatic function.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Age There were no significant changes observed in AUC of febuxostat or its metabolites following multiple oral doses of ADENURIC in elderly as compared to younger healthy subjects.</seg>
<seg id="1238">12 Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility In male rats, a statistically significant increase in urinary bladder tumours (transitional cell papilloma and carcinoma) was found only in association with xanthine calculi in the high dose group, at approximately 11 times human exposure.</seg>
<seg id="1239">These findings are considered a consequence of species specific purine metabolism and urine composition and of no relevance to clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="1240">Febuxostat at oral doses up to 48 mg/ kg/ day was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance of male and female rats.</seg>
<seg id="1241">There was high dose maternal toxicity accompanied by a reduction in weaning index and reduced development of offspring in rats at approximately 4.3 times human exposure.</seg>
<seg id="1242">Teratology studies, performed in pregnant rats at approximately 4.3 times and pregnant rabbits at approximately 13 times human exposure did not reveal any teratogenic effects.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Colchicine/ indometacin/ hydrochlorothiazide/ warfarin Febuxostat can be co-administered with colchicine or indomethacin with no dose adjustment of febuxostat or the co-administered active substance being necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting are more frequent in patients concomitantly treated with colchicine ** No serious rashes or severe hypersensitivity reactions were noted in the clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Long-term open label extension studies In the long-term open label extension studies, the number of patients treated with febuxostat 80 mg/ 120 mg up to 1 year was 906, up to 2 years was 322, up to 3 years was 57, and up 4 years was 53.</seg>

<seg id="1254">In some people, the amount of uric acid builds up in the blood and may become too high to remain soluble.</seg>
<seg id="1255">Keeping uric acid levels low by taking ADENURIC once every day stops crystals building up, and over time it reduces symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1256">Do not take ADENURIC if you are: • If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to febuxostat, the active ingredient of ADENURIC, or any of the other ingredients in these tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1257">Take special care with ADENURIC Tell your doctor before you start to take this medicine: • If you have or have had heart failure or heart problems • If you are being treated for high uric acid levels as a result of cancer disease or Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (a rare inherited condition in which there is too much uric acid in the blood) • If you have thyroid problems</seg>
<seg id="1258">If you are having a gout attack at the moment (a sudden onset of severe pain, tenderness, redness, warmth and swelling in a joint), wait for the gout attack to subside before first starting treatment with ADENURIC.</seg>
<seg id="1259">Not everyone gets flares, but you could get a flare-up even if you are taking ADENURIC, and especially during the first weeks or months of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1260">Your doctor will often prescribe other medicines, if they are needed, to help prevent or treat the symptoms of flares (such as pain and swelling in a joint).</seg>
<seg id="1261">Taking other medicines Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, or have recently taken, any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.</seg>

<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100) are headache, musculoskeletal (bone, muscle or joint) pain and gastro-intestinal symptoms such as abdominal (tummy) pain, dyspepsia (indigestion), constipation, diarrhoea, flatulence (wind), oesophageal (gullet) ulcers, dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), abdominal distension (swollen tummy) and acid regurgitation.</seg>
<seg id="1283">ADROVANCE should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to alendronate, vitamin D3 or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1284">It should not be used where there are abnormalities of the oesophagus (gullet), in patients who have hypocalcaemia (low calcium levels), or in patients who cannot stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1285">The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for ADROVANCE to Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd. on 4 January 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1286">Capsule-shaped, white to off-white tablets, marked with an outline of a bone image on one side, and '710 'on the other.</seg>
<seg id="1287">ADROVANCE must be taken with water only (not mineral water) at least 30 minutes before the first food, beverage, or medicinal product (including antacids, calcium supplements and vitamins) of the day.</seg>
<seg id="1288">The following instructions should be followed exactly in order to minimize the risk of oesophageal irritation and related adverse reactions (see section 4.4):</seg>
<seg id="1289">• ADROVANCE should only be swallowed after getting up for the day with a full glass of water (not less than 200ml or 7fl. oz.).</seg>
<seg id="1290">Because there is a potential for worsening of the underlying disease, caution should be used when alendronate is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems, such as dysphagia, oesophageal disease, gastritis, duodenitis, ulcers, or with a recent history (within the previous year) of major gastrointestinal disease such as peptic ulcer, or active gastrointestinal bleeding, or surgery of the upper gastrointestinal tract other than pyloroplasty (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1291">Oesophageal reactions (sometimes severe and requiring hospitalisation), such as oesophagitis, oesophageal ulcers and oesophageal erosions, rarely followed by oesophageal stricture, have been reported in patients receiving alendronate.</seg>
<seg id="1292">Physicians should therefore be alert to any signs or symptoms signalling a possible oesophageal reaction and patients should be instructed to discontinue alendronate and seek medical attention if they develop symptoms of oesophageal irritation such as dysphagia, pain on swallowing or retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">The risk of severe oesophageal adverse reactions appears to be greater in patients who fail to take alendronate properly and/ or who continue to take alendronate after developing symptoms suggestive of oesophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that the full dosing instructions are provided to, and are understood by the patient (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">3 While no increased risk was observed in extensive clinical trials with alendronate, there have been rare (post-marketing) reports of gastric and duodenal ulcers, some of which were severe and with complications (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1296">Osteonecrosis of the jaw, generally associated with tooth extraction and/ or local infection (including osteomyelitis) has been reported in patients with cancer who are receiving treatment regimens including primarily intravenously administered bisphosphonates.</seg>
<seg id="1297">For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Clinical judgement of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/ risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Patients should be instructed that if they miss a dose of ADROVANCE they should take one tablet on the morning after they remember.</seg>
<seg id="1300">They should not take two tablets on the same day but should return to taking one tablet once a week, as originally scheduled on their chosen day.</seg>
<seg id="1301">Other disorders affecting mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyroidism) should also be effectively treated before starting ADROVANCE.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Alendronate If taken at the same time, it is likely that food and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids, and some oral medicinal products will interfere with absorption of alendronate.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Therefore, patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking alendronate before taking any other oral medicinal product (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interaction studies were not performed, in clinical studies alendronate was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed medicinal products without evidence of interactions of clinical relevance.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is only intended for use in postmenopausal women and therefore it should not be used during pregnancy or in breast-feeding women.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Animal studies with alendronate do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, or postnatal development.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The majority of the reports refer to cancer patients, but such cases have also been reported in patients treated for osteoporosis.</seg>
<seg id="1308">However, the incidences of decreases in serum calcium to < 8.0 mg/ dl (2.0 mmol/ l) and serum phosphate to ≤ 2.0 mg/ dl (0.65 mmol/ l) were similar in both treatment groups.</seg>
<seg id="1309">Alendronate Hypocalcaemia, hypophosphataemia and upper gastrointestinal adverse reactions, such as upset stomach, heartburn, oesophagitis, gastritis, or ulcer, may result from oral overdose.</seg>
<seg id="1310">Colecalciferol (vitamin D3) Vitamin D3 is produced in the skin by conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to vitamin D3 by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="1311">The principal action of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 is to increase intestinal absorption of both calcium and phosphate as well as regulate serum calcium, renal calcium and phosphate excretion, bone formation and bone resorption.</seg>
<seg id="1312">In severe cases, deficiency results in secondary hyperparathyroidism, hypophosphataemia, proximal muscle weakness and osteomalacia, further increasing the risk of falls and fractures in osteoporotic individuals.</seg>
<seg id="1313">Osteoporosis is defined as bone mineral density (BMD) of the spine or hip 2.5 standard deviations (SD) below the mean value of a normal young population or as a previous fragility fracture, irrespective of BMD.</seg>
<seg id="1314">Patients received the lower strength (70 mg/ 2800 IU) of ADROVANCE (n=350) or FOSAMAX (alendronate) 70 mg (n=332) once a week; additional vitamin D supplements</seg>
<seg id="1315">After 15 weeks of treatment, the mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were significantly higher (26%) in the ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2800 IU) group (56 nmol/ l [23 ng/ ml]) than in the alendronate-only group (46 nmol/ l [18.2 ng/ ml]).</seg>
<seg id="1316">The percentage of patients with vitamin D insufficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 37.5 nmol/ l [< 15 ng/ ml]) was significantly reduced by 62.5% with ADROVANCE (70 mg/ 2800 IU) vs. alendronate-only (12% vs.</seg>
<seg id="1317">Alendronate studies The therapeutic equivalence of alendronate once weekly 70 mg (n=519) and alendronate 10 mg daily (n=370) was demonstrated in a one-year multicentre study of post-menopausal women with osteoporosis.</seg>
<seg id="1318">The effects of alendronate on bone mass and fracture incidence in post-menopausal women were examined in two initial efficacy studies of identical design (n=994) as well as in the Fracture Intervention Trial (FIT: n=6,459).</seg>
<seg id="1319">In the initial efficacy studies, the mean BMD increases with alendronate 10 mg/ day relative to placebo at three years were 8.8%, 5.9% and 7.8% at the spine, femoral neck and trochanter, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="1320">There was a 48% reduction (alendronate 3.2% vs placebo 6.2%) in the proportion of patients treated with alendronate experiencing one or more vertebral fractures relative to those treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1321">In the two-year extension of these studies BMD at the spine and trochanter continued to increase and BMD at the femoral neck and total body were maintained.</seg>
<seg id="1322">FIT consisted of two placebo-controlled studies using alendronate daily (5 mg daily for two years and 10 mg daily for either one or two additional years):</seg>
<seg id="1323">In this study alendronate daily reduced the incidence of ≥ 1 new vertebral fracture by 47% (alendronate 7.9% vs. placebo 15.0%).</seg>
<seg id="1324">Absorption Relative to an intravenous reference dose, the oral mean bioavailability of alendronate in women was 0.64% for doses ranging from 5 to 70 mg when administered after an overnight fast and two hours before a standardised breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Bioavailability was decreased similarly to an estimated 0.46% and 0.39% when alendronate was administered one hour or half an hour before a standardised breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="1326">In osteoporosis studies, alendronate was effective when administered at least 30 minutes before the first food or beverage of the day.</seg>
<seg id="1327">In healthy subjects, oral prednisone (20 mg three times daily for five days) did not produce a clinically meaningful change in oral bioavailability of alendronate (a mean increase ranging from 20% to 44%).</seg>
<seg id="1328">Distribution Studies in rats show that alendronate transiently distributes to soft tissues following 1 mg/ kg intravenous administration but is then rapidly redistributed to bone or excreted in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Elimination Following a single intravenous dose of [14C]alendronate, approximately 50% of the radioactivity was excreted in the urine within 72 hours and little or no radioactivity was recovered in the faeces.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Following a single 10 mg intravenous dose, the renal clearance of alendronate was 71 ml/ min, and systemic clearance did not exceed 200 ml/ min.</seg>
<seg id="1331">Alendronate is not excreted through the acidic or basic transport systems of the kidney in rats, and thus it is not anticipated to interfere with the excretion of other medicinal products by those systems in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Absorption In healthy adult subjects (males and females), following administration of ADROVANCE after an overnight fast and two hours before a meal, the mean area under the serum-concentration-time curve (AUC0-120 hrs) for vitamin D3 (unadjusted for endogenous vitamin D3 levels) was 296.4 ng• hr/ ml.</seg>
<seg id="1333">The mean maximal serum concentration (Cmax) of vitamin D3 was 5.9 ng/ ml, and the median time to maximal serum concentration (Tmax) was 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1334">Biotransformation Vitamin D3 is rapidly metabolized by hydroxylation in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, and subsequently metabolized in the kidney to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, which represents the biologically active form.</seg>
<seg id="1335">Elimination When radioactive vitamin D3 was administered to healthy subjects, the mean urinary excretion of radioactivity after 48 hours was 2.4%, and the mean faecal excretion of radioactivity after 4 days was 4.9%.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Characteristics in patients Preclinical studies show that alendronate that is not deposited in bone is rapidly excreted in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Although no clinical information is available, it is likely that, as in animals, elimination of alendronate via the kidney will be reduced in patients with impaired renal function.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Therefore, somewhat greater accumulation of alendronate in bone might be expected in patients with impaired renal function (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1339">Alendronate Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential.</seg>
<seg id="1340">Studies in rats have shown that treatment with alendronate during pregnancy was associated with dystocia in dams during parturition which was related to hypocalcaemia.</seg>

<seg id="1401">Advagraf is used in adult patients who have had a kidney or liver transplant, to prevent rejection (when the immune system attacks the transplanted organ).</seg>
<seg id="1402">Because tacrolimus and Prograf/ Prograft have already been used in the EU, the company presented the results of studies that had been carried out with Prograf/ Prograft previously, as well as data from the published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1403">It also presented the results of a clinical study in 668 kidney transplant patients comparing the use of Advagraf with that of Prograf/ Prograft or ciclosporin (another immunosuppressive medicine used in the prevention of rejection).</seg>
<seg id="1404">The main measure of effectiveness was the number of patients in whom the transplant failed (as measured by looking at, for example, the need for a repeat transplant or a return to dialysis) after one year’ s treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1405">Further shorter studies were also carried out in 119 kidney transplant patients and 129 liver transplant patients, looking at how Advagraf is absorbed by the body in comparison to Prograf/ Prograft.</seg>
<seg id="1406">The most common side effects with Advagraf (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are tremor (shaking), headache, nausea (feeling sick), diarrhoea, kidney problems, hyperglycaemia (raised blood glucose levels), diabetes, hyperkalaemia (raised blood potassium levels), hypertension (high blood pressure) and insomnia (difficulty sleeping).</seg>
<seg id="1407">Advagraf should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to tacrolimus, to macrolide antibiotics (such as erythromycin) or to any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Patients and doctors must be careful when other medicines (including some herbal remedies) are taken at the same time as Advagraf, as there may be a need to adjust the dose of Advagraf or the dose of the medicine it is taken with.</seg>

<seg id="1411">This can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects, including under- or overimmunosuppression, due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure to tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should be maintained on a single formulation of tacrolimus with the corresponding daily dosing regimen; alterations in formulation or regimen should only take place under the close supervision of a transplant specialist (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">Following conversion to any alternative formulation, therapeutic drug monitoring must be performed and dose adjustments made to ensure that systemic exposure to tacrolimus is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="1414">Advagraf dosing should primarily be based on clinical assessments of rejection and tolerability in each patient individually aided by blood level monitoring (see below under “ Target whole blood trough concentration recommendations”).</seg>
<seg id="1415">When converting from Prograf capsules to Advagraf tacrolimus trough levels should be measured prior to conversion and within two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">By Day 4, systemic exposure as measured by trough levels is similar for both kidney and liver transplant patients with both formulations.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and frequent monitoring of tacrolimus trough levels is recommended in the first two weeks post-transplant with Advagraf to ensure adequate drug exposure in the immediate post-transplant period.</seg>
<seg id="1418">As tacrolimus is a substance with low clearance, adjustments to the Advagraf dose regimen may take several days before steady state is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="1419">In patients unable to take oral medicinal products during the immediate post-transplant period, tacrolimus therapy can be initiated intravenously (Prograf 5 mg/ ml Concentrate for Infusion) at a dose approximately 1/ 5th of the recommended oral dose for that indication.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Duration of dosing To suppress graft rejection, immunosuppression must be maintained; consequently, no limit to the duration of oral therapy can be given.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dose recommendations - Kidney transplantation Prophylaxis of transplant rejection Oral Advagraf therapy should commence at a dose of 0.20 - 0.30 mg/ kg/ day administered once daily in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Post-transplant improvement in the condition of the patient may alter the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus and may necessitate further dose adjustments.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dose recommendations - Liver transplantation Prophylaxis of transplant rejection Oral Advagraf therapy should commence at a dose of 0.10 - 0.20 mg/ kg/ day administered once daily in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dose recommendations – Conversion of Prograf treated patients to Advagraf Allograft transplant patients maintained on twice daily Prograf capsules dosing requiring conversion to once daily Advagraf should be converted on a 1:1 (mg: mg) total daily dose basis.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplantation For conversion from other immunosuppressants to once daily Advagraf, treatment should begin with the initial oral dose recommended in kidney and liver transplantation respectively for prophylaxis of transplant rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplantation In adult patients converted to Advagraf, an initial oral dose of 0.15 mg/ kg/ day should be administered once daily in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other allografts transplantation Although there is no clinical experience with Advagraf in lung-transplanted, pancreas-transplanted and intestine-transplanted patients, Prograf has been used in lung-transplanted patients at an initial oral dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg/ kg/ day, in pancreas-transplanted patients at an initial oral dose of 0.2 mg/ kg/ day and in intestinal transplantation at an initial oral dose of 0.3 mg/ kg/ day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dose adjustments in specific patient populations Patients with liver impairment Dose reduction may be necessary in patients with severe liver impairment in order to maintain the blood trough levels within the recommended target range.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with kidney impairment As the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus are unaffected by renal function, no dose adjustment should be required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">However, owing to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus careful monitoring of renal function is recommended (including serial serum creatinine concentrations, calculation of creatinine clearance and monitoring of urine output).</seg>
<seg id="1431">Conversion from ciclosporin to Advagraf Care should be taken when converting patients from ciclosporin-based to tacrolimus-based therapy (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Target whole blood trough concentration recommendations Dosing should primarily be based on clinical assessments of rejection and tolerability in each individual patient aided by whole blood tacrolimus trough level monitoring.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Frequent trough level monitoring in the initial two weeks post transplantation is recommended, 4 followed by periodic monitoring during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood trough levels of tacrolimus should also be monitored following conversion from Prograf to Advagraf, dose adjustment, changes in the immunosuppressive regimen, or co-administration of substances which may alter tacrolimus whole blood concentrations (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">As Advagraf is a medicinal product with low clearance, adjustments to the Advagraf dose regimen may take several days before steady state is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="1436">Clinical study analysis suggests that the majority of patients can be successfully managed if tacrolimus blood trough levels are maintained below 20 ng/ ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, whole blood trough levels have generally been in the range 5 - 20 ng/ ml in liver transplant recipients and 10 - 20 ng/ ml in kidney and heart transplant patients in the early post- transplant period.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During subsequent maintenance therapy, blood concentrations have generally been in the range of 5 - 15 ng/ ml in liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including graft rejection, or other side effects which could be a consequence of either under- or over- exposure to tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should be maintained on a single formulation of tacrolimus with the corresponding daily dosing regimen; alterations in formulation or regimen should only take place under the close supervision of a transplant specialist (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">For treatment of allograft rejection resistant to treatment with other immunosuppressive medicinal products in adult patients clinical data are not yet available for the prolonged-release formulation Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">For prophylaxis of transplant rejection in adult heart allograft recipients and for paediatric allograft recipients clinical data are not yet available for the prolonged-release formulation Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">John’ s Wort (Hypericum perforatum) or other herbal preparations should be avoided when taking Advagraf due to the risk of interactions that lead to decrease in blood concentrations of tacrolimus and reduced clinical effect of tacrolimus (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">Since levels of tacrolimus in blood may significantly change during diarrhoea episodes, extra monitoring of tacrolimus concentrations is recommended during episodes of diarrhoea.</seg>
<seg id="1445">Ventricular hypertrophy or hypertrophy of the septum, reported as cardiomyopathies, have been observed in Prograf treated patients on rare occasions and may therefore also occur with Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors observed to increase the risk of these clinical 5 conditions included pre-existing heart disease, corticosteroid usage, hypertension, renal or hepatic dysfunction, infections, fluid overload, and oedema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressive agents, owing to the potential risk of malignant skin changes, exposure to sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients taking tacrolimus present with symptoms indicating PRES such as headache, altered mental status, seizures, and visual disturbances, a radiological procedure (e. g.</seg>
<seg id="1449">As Advagraf prolonged-release capsules contain lactose, special care should be taken in patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption.</seg>
<seg id="1450">Concomitant use of medicinal products or herbal remedies known to inhibit or induce CYP3A4 may affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and thereby increase or decrease tacrolimus blood levels.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor tacrolimus blood levels whenever substances which have the potential to alter CYP3A metabolism are used concomitantly and to adjust the tacrolimus dose as appropriate in order to maintain similar tacrolimus exposure (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">Strong interactions have been observed with antifungal agents such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole, the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin or HIV protease inhibitors (e. g.</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetics studies have indicated that the increase in blood levels is mainly a result of increase in oral bioavailability of tacrolimus owing to the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">High dose prednisolone or methylprednisolone administered for the treatment of acute rejection have the potential to increase or decrease tacrolimus blood levels.</seg>
<seg id="1455">Effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicinal products Tacrolimus is a known CYP3A4 inhibitor; thus concomitant use of tacrolimus with medicinal products known to be metabolised by CYP3A4 may affect the metabolism of such medicinal products.</seg>
<seg id="1456">As tacrolimus may reduce the clearance of steroid-based contraceptives leading to increased hormone exposure, particular care should be exercised when deciding upon contraceptive measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">Animal data have shown that tacrolimus could potentially decrease the clearance and increase the half- life of pentobarbital and antipyrine.</seg>
<seg id="1458">Limited data from organ transplant recipients show no evidence of an increased risk of adverse events on the course and outcome of pregnancy under tacrolimus treatment compared with other immunosuppressive medicinal products.</seg>
<seg id="1459">Tacrolimus treatment can be considered in pregnant women, when there is no safer alternative and when the perceived benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus.</seg>
<seg id="1460">In case of in utero exposure, monitoring of the newborn for the potential adverse events of tacrolimus is recommended (in particular effects on the kidneys). There is a risk for premature delivery (< 37 week) as well as for hyperkalaemia in the newborn (incidence 8 of 111 neonates, i. e.</seg>
<seg id="1461">The adverse reaction profile associated with immunosuppressive agents is often difficult to establish owing to the underlying disease and the concurrent use of multiple medications.</seg>
<seg id="1462">Adverse reactions are listed below in descending order by frequency of occurrence: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10); uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100); rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000); very rare (< 1/ 10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).</seg>
<seg id="1463">ischaemic coronary artery disorders, tachycardia ventricular arrhythmias and cardiac arrest, heart failures, cardiomyopathies, ventricular hypertrophy, supraventricular arrhythmias, palpitations, ECG investigations abnormal, heart rate and pulse investigations abnormal</seg>
<seg id="1464">diarrhoea, nausea gastrointestinal inflammatory conditions, gastrointestinal ulceration and perforation, gastrointestinal haemorrhages, stomatitis and ulceration, ascites, vomiting, gastrointestinal and abdominal pains, dyspeptic signs and symptoms, constipation, flatulence, bloating and distension, loose stools, gastrointestinal signs and symptoms</seg>
<seg id="1465">Infections and infestations As is well known for other potent immunosuppressive agents, patients receiving tacrolimus are frequently at increased risk for infections (viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoal).</seg>
<seg id="1466">Cases of BK virus associated nephropathy, as well as cases of JC virus associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), have been reported in patients treated with immunosuppressants, including Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1467">Benign as well as malignant neoplasms including EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorders and skin malignancies have been reported in association with tacrolimus treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Based on its high molecular weight, poor aqueous solubility, and extensive erythrocyte and plasma protein binding, it is anticipated that tacrolimus will not be dialysable.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects At the molecular level, the effects of tacrolimus appear to be mediated by binding to a cytosolic protein (FKBP12) which is responsible for the intracellular accumulation of the compound.</seg>
<seg id="1470">The FKBP12-tacrolimus complex specifically and competitively binds to and inhibits calcineurin, leading to a calcium-dependent inhibition of T-cell signal transduction pathways, thereby preventing transcription of a discrete set of lymphokine genes.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Tacrolimus suppresses T-cell activation and T-helper-cell dependent B-cell proliferation, as well as the formation of lymphokines (such as interleukins-2, -3, and γ -interferon) and the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="1472">The event rate of biopsy confirmed acute rejection within the first 24 weeks after transplantation was 32.6% in the Advagraf group (N=237) and 29.3% in the Prograf group (N=234).</seg>
<seg id="1473">The treatment difference (Advagraf – Prograf) was 3.3% (95% confidence interval [-5.7%, 12.3%]). The 12-month patient survival rates were 89.2% for Advagraf and 90.8% for Prograf; in the Advagraf arm 25 patients died (14 female, 11 male) and in the Prograf arm 24 patients died (5 female, 19 male).</seg>
<seg id="1474">Kidney transplantation The efficacy and safety of Advagraf and Prograf, both in combination with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and corticosteroids, was compared in 667 de novo kidney transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The 12-month patient survival rates were 96.9% for Advagraf and 97.5% for Prograf; in the Advagraf arm 10 patients died (3 female, 7 male) and in the Prograf arm 8 patients died (3 female, 5 male).</seg>
<seg id="1476">11 The efficacy and safety of Prograf, ciclosporin and Advagraf, all in combination with basiliximab antibody induction, MMF and corticosteroids, was compared in 638 de novo kidney transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The incidence of efficacy failure at 12 months (defined as death, graft loss, biopsy- confirmed acute rejection, or lost to follow-up) was 14.0% in the Advagraf group (N=214), 15.1% in the Prograf group (N=212) and 17.0% in the ciclosporin group (N=212).</seg>
<seg id="1478">The treatment difference was -3.0% (Advagraf-ciclosporin) (95.2% confidence interval [-9.9%, 4.0%]) for Advagraf vs. ciclosporin and -1.9% (Prograf-ciclosporin) (95.2% confidence interval [-8.9%, 5.2%]) for Prograf vs. ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The 12-month patient survival rates were 98.6% for Advagraf, 95.7% for Prograf and 97.6% for ciclosporin; in the Advagraf arm 3 patients died (all male), in the Prograf arm 10 patients died (3 female, 7 male) and in the ciclosporin arm 6 patients died (3 female, 3 male).</seg>
<seg id="1480">Results from published data of tacrolimus administered twice daily as Prograf capsules in other primary organ transplantation Prograf has evolved into an accepted treatment as primary immunosuppressive medicinal product following pancreas, lung and intestinal transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1481">In prospective published studies oral Prograf was investigated as primary immunosuppressant in approximately 175 patients following lung, 475 patients following pancreas and 630 patients following intestinal transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral Prograf in these published studies appeared to be similar to what was reported in the large studies, where Prograf was used as primary treatment in liver, kidney and heart transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation The interim analysis of a recent multicentre study using oral Prograf discussed 110 patients who underwent 1:1 randomisation to either tacrolimus or ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1484">A lower incidence of acute rejection episodes for tacrolimus- versus ciclosporin-treated patients (11.5% versus 22.6%) and a lower incidence of chronic rejection, the bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (2.86% versus 8.57%), was reported within the first year after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1485">The 1-year patient survival rate was 80.8% in the tacrolimus and 83% in the ciclosporin group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, US, 2004; Abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">Obliterative bronchiolitis developed in 21.7% of patients in the tacrolimus group compared with 38.0% of patients in the ciclosporin group (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">Significantly more ciclosporin-treated patients (n = 13) required a switch to tacrolimus than tacrolimus-treated patients to ciclosporin (n = 2) (p = 0.02) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60:580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">Freedom from acute rejection was higher in the tacrolimus group at 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and at 1 year after lung transplantation (50% versus 33.3%) (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20:511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">The incidences of acute rejection were numerically lower with tacrolimus in all three studies and one of the studies reported a significantly lower incidence of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Pancreas transplantation A multicentre study using oral Prograf included 205 patients undergoing simultaneous pancreas- kidney transplantation who were randomised to tacrolimus (n = 103) or to ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The initial oral per protocol dose of tacrolimus was 0.2 mg/ kg/ day with subsequent dose adjustments to target trough levels of 8 to 15 ng/ ml by Day 5 and 5 to 10 ng/ mL after Month 6.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Intestinal transplantation Published clinical experience from a single centre on the use of oral Prograf for primary treatment following intestinal transplantation showed that the actuarial survival rate of 155 patients (65 intestine alone, 75 liver and intestine, and 25 multivisceral) receiving tacrolimus and prednisone was 75% at 1 year, 54% at 5 years, and 42% at 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="1493">A variety of innovations, such as techniques for early detection of Epstein-Barr (EBV) and CMV infections, bone marrow augmentation, the adjunct use of the interleukin-2 antagonist daclizumab, lower initial tacrolimus doses with target trough levels of 10 to 15 ng/ ml, and most recently allograft irradiation were considered to have contributed to improved results in this indication over time (Abu- Elmagd et al., Ann Surg 2001; 234:404).</seg>
<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematocrit and protein levels, which result in an increase in the unbound fraction of tacrolimus, or corticosteroid-induced increased metabolism are considered to be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed following transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1495">Less than 1% of unchanged tacrolimus was detected in the urine and faeces, indicating that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolised prior to elimination: bile being the principal route of elimination.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In stable patients converted from Prograf (twice daily) to Advagraf (once daily) on a 1:1 (mg: mg) total daily dose basis the systemic exposure to tacrolimus (AUC0-24) for Advagraf was approximately 10% lower than that for Prograf.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Frequent trough level monitoring in the initial two weeks post transplantation is recommended, 18 followed by periodic monitoring during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For treatment of allograft rejection resistant to treatment with other immunosuppressive medicinal products in adult patients clinical data are not yet available for the prolonged-release formulation Advagraf.</seg>

<seg id="1513">You may also be given Advagraf for an ongoing rejection of your transplanted liver, kidney, heart or other organ or if any previous treatment you were taking was unable to control this immune response after your transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Taking other medicines Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal remedies.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Your doctor also needs to know if you are taking potassium supplements or potassium-sparing diuretics (e. g. amiloride, triamterene, or spironolactone), certain pain killers (so-called NSAIDs, e. g. ibuprofen), anticoagulants, or oral medication for diabetic treatment, while you take Advagraf.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advate is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (an inherited bleeding disorder caused by lack of factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dose and frequency depend on whether Advate is used to treat haemorrhage (bleeding) or to prevent it during surgery.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A lack factor VIII, and this causes blood coagulation problems, such as bleeding in the joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but produced by a method known as ‘ recombinant DNA technology’: it is made by a cell that has received a gene (DNA), which makes it able to produce human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Advate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union (EU) called Recombinate, but it is prepared differently so that there are no human- or animal-derived proteins in the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Reproduction is authorised provided the source is acknowledged. of bleeding episodes and rated Advate’ s effectiveness in stopping bleeding on a scale from ‘ none’ to ‘ excellent’ in 107 patients, all of whom received Advate.</seg>
<seg id="1536">Three additional studies looked at the use of the medicine in the prevention of bleeding and in surgery in patients with severe or moderately severe haemophilia A, including one study in 53 children under the age of six years.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the effectiveness of Advate in the prevention of bleeding was rated as ‘ excellent’ or ‘ good’ in 86% of the 510 new bleeding episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects with Advate (seen in between 1 to 10 patients in 100) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the presence of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advate should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to human coagulation factor VIII, to mouse or hamster protein, or to any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the EU for Advate to Baxter AG on 2 March 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Posology The posology and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, on the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient’ s clinical condition.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given plasma activity level (in% of normal or IU/ dl) in the corresponding period.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours (8 to 24 hours for patients under the age of 6) for 3 – 4 days or more until pain and acute disability are resolved.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours (6 to 12 hours for patients under the age of 6) until threat is resolved.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of plasma factor VIII levels is advised to guide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may vary in their response to factor VIII, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 Prophylaxis For long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A, the usual doses are 20 to 40 IU of factor VIIIper kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activity levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, an assay should be performed to determine if a factor VIII inhibitor is present.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high levels of inhibitor, factor VIII substitution therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The rate of administration should be determined to ensure the comfort of the patient up to a maximum of 10 ml/ min.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a known complication in the management of individuals with haemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are usually IgGs directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) per ml of plasma using the modified Bethesda assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the extent of exposure to factor VIII, the risk being highest within the first 20 exposure days, and to other genetic and environmental factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Cases of recurrent inhibitor (low titre) have been observed after switching from one factor VIII product to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a history of inhibitor development.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Based on the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of Factor VIII during pregnancy and breast-feeding is not available.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs that occurred in the highest number of patients were development of factor VIII inhibitors (5 patients), all occurring in previously untreated patients who had elevated risk of inhibitor development, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Frequency categories are defined according to the following convention: very common (≥ 1/ 10), common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10), uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100), rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000), very rare (< 1/ 10,000), not known (cannot be calculated from the available data).</seg>
<seg id="1558">a) Percent of patients calculated based on total number of unique patients (234). b) The unexpected decrease in coagulation factor VIII levels occurred in one patient during continuous infusion of ADVATE following surgery (postoperative days 10-14).</seg>
<seg id="1559">Haemostasis was maintained at all times during this period and both plasma factor VIII levels and clearance rates returned to appropriate levels by postoperative day 15.</seg>
<seg id="1560">During clinical trials with ADVATE in 145 paediatric and adult patients 2 diagnosed with severe to moderately severe haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%), with previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates ≥ 150 days, one patient developed a low-titre inhibitor (2.4 BU in the modified Bethesda assay) after 26 exposure days to ADVATE.</seg>
<seg id="1561">Also, in 53 paediatric patients under the age of 6, also diagnosed with severe to moderately severe haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%), with previous exposure to factor VIII concentrates ≥ 50 days, no FVIII inhibitor was detected.</seg>
<seg id="1562">In previously untreated patients in an ongoing clinical study, 5 (20%) of 25 patients who received ADVATE developed inhibitors to factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The patient’ s immune response to trace amounts of contaminating proteins was analysed by examining titres of antibodies to these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1564">One patient had both a statistically significant upward trend and displayed a sustained peak in anti-CHO protein antibody level, but no other signs or symptoms indicative of an allergic or hypersensitivity response.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based upon the data that have become available since the granting of the initial Marketing Authorisation, the CHMP considers that the benefit/risk balance of Advate remains positive, but considers that its safety profile is to be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, based upon the safety profile of Advate, which requires the submission of 6-monthly PSURs, the CHMP concluded that the MAH should submit one additional renewal application in 5 years time.</seg>
<seg id="1640">On 17 December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited officially notified the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that it wishes to withdraw its application for a marketing authorisation for Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Li-Fraumeni cancer can occur in many areas of the body but usually affects the breast, brain, bone or soft tissue (tissue that connects, surrounds and supports other structures in the body).</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus that has been altered genetically so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is an ‘ adenovirus ’ that has been engineered so that it cannot make copies of itself and therefore does not cause infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin was expected to be injected directly into the tumours, thus allowing the cancer cells to produce normal p53 protein again.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is produced from the non-defective p53 gene present in the human body, normally contributes to the repair of damaged DNA and causes cell death when the DNA cannot be repaired.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In Li-Fraumeni cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented information from a study on one patient with Li-Fraumeni cancer in the lower abdomen, the bones and the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had assessed the responses from the company to a list of questions, there were still some unresolved issues outstanding.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the review of the initial documentation, the CHMP prepares a list of questions at day 120, which is sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">The CHMP was concerned that there was not enough evidence to show that the injection of Advexin into Li-Fraumeni tumours led to benefits for patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee also had concerns over what happens to the medicine in the body, how it should be given and how safe it is.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not supplied enough evidence to demonstrate that Advexin could be made in a reliable manner, or that it would not be harmful to the environment or to people in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not inform the CHMP whether there were any consequences of the withdrawal for patients in clinical trials or compassionate use programmes with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">It is available as blue and white modified-release tablets. ‘ Modified-release ’ means that the tablets have been made to allow one of the active substances to be released immediately and the other one released over a few hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hayfever, inflammation of the nasal passages caused by an allergy to pollen) in patients who have nasal congestion (a blocked nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">In adults and adolescents over 12 years of age, the recommended dose of Aerinaze is one tablet twice a day, taken whole with a full glass of water, with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Treatment should continue for as short a time as possible and should stop when symptoms, chiefly the congestion (blocked nose), have disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="1658">Treatment for more than 10 days is not advisable, as the medicine ’ s effects on nasal congestion may wear off.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main measures of effectiveness were the change in the severity of hayfever symptoms reported by the patients between before treatment started, and over the entire 15 days of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">The patients recorded their symptoms in a diary every 12 hours during the study, scoring on a standard symptom scale how severe the symptoms were over the previous 12-hour period.</seg>
<seg id="1661">When looking at all hayfever symptoms except for nasal congestion, patients taking Aerinaze reported a reduction in symptoms of 46.0%, compared with 35.9% in those taking pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">When looking at nasal congestion, patients taking Aerinaze had a reduction in symptoms of 37.4%, compared with 26.7% in those taking desloratadine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects with Aerinaze (seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100) are tachycardia (fast heart rate), dry mouth, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), pharyngitis (sore throat), anorexia (loss of appetite), constipation, headache, fatigue (tiredness), insomnia (difficulty sleeping), somnolence (sleepiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadine, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, to adrenergic agents or to loratadine (another medicine used to treat allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze should also not be taken by people who have narrow- angle glaucoma (increased pressure inside the eye), urinary retention (difficulty in passing urine), heart or blood vessel diseases including hypertension (high blood pressure), hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid gland), or a history or risk of haemorrhagic stroke (stroke caused by bleeding within the brain).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Aerinaze to SP Europe on 30 July 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet may be taken with a full glass of water but must be swallowed entirely (without crushing, breaking or chewing it).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used in children below the age of 12 years due to a lack of data on safety and efficacy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of treatment should be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is advisable to limit treatment to about 10 days, as during chronic administration the activity of pseudoephedrine may diminish.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After improvement of the congestive condition of the mucosae of the upper airway, treatment may be maintained with desloratadine alone, if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1672">As Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, it is also contraindicated in patients who are receiving monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor therapy or during the 2 weeks following the stopping of such treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alpha-mimetic activity of pseudoephedrine in combination with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocripitine, pergolide, lisuride, cabergoline, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine or any other decongestant medicinal product used as a nasal decongestant, either by oral route or by nasal route (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, naphazoline…).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of the combination have not been established in this population, and there are insufficient data to give adequate dose recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of Aerinaze has not been established in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function, and there are insufficient data to give adequate dose recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients should be informed that the treatment should be discontinued in case of hypertension, tachycardia, palpitations or cardiac arrhythmias, nausea or any other neurological sign (such as headache or increased headache).</seg>
<seg id="1677">Caution should be exercised in the following patient groups: • Patients receiving digitalis • Patients with cardiac arrhythmias • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a history of myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, bladder neck obstruction, or positive anamnesis of bronchospasm.</seg>
<seg id="1678">The administration of Aerinaze should be discontinued at least 48 hours before skin tests since antihistamines maybe prevent or reduce other wise positive reaction to dermal reactivity index.</seg>
<seg id="1679">However, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in desloratadine plasma concentrations were observed in clinical trials with desloratadine in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were co-administered.</seg>
<seg id="1680">No significant differences were found in the psychomotor test results between desloratadine and placebo groups, whether administered alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadine has not been identified yet, and therefore, some interactions with other medicinal products can not be fully excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadine does not inhibit CYP3A4 in vivo, and in vitro studies have shown that the medicinal product does not inhibit CYP2D6 and is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The safe use of Aerinaze during pregnancy has not been established; however experience from a large number of exposed pregnancies in humans does not reveal any increase in the frequency of malformations as compared to the incidence in the general population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">4 Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, Aerinaze should not be used during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that very rarely some people experience drowsiness, which may affect their ability to drive or use machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary from CNS depression (sedation, apnoea, diminished mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) to CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucination, tremors, convulsions) with possible fatal outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Other symptoms may include: headache, anxiety, micturition difficulty, muscle weakness and tenseness, euphoria, excitement, respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmias, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, perspiration, nausea, vomiting, precordial pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, blurred vision and hypertension or hypotension.</seg>
<seg id="1688">CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as are atropine-like symptoms (dry mouth, fixed and dilated pupils, flushing, hyperthermia, and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include inhibiting the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-13 from human mast cells/ basophils, as well as inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecule P-selectin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study performed in adults, desloratadine 5 mg did not affect standard measures of flight performance including exacerbation of subjective sleepiness or tasks related to flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily, there was no excess incidence of somnolence as compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Oral administration of pseudoephedrine at the recommended dose can cause other sympathomimetic effects, such as increased blood pressure, tachycardia or manifestations of central nervous system excitation.</seg>
<seg id="1693">The clinical efficacy and safety of Aerinaze tablets was evaluated in two, 2-week multicentre, randomized parallel group clinical trials involving 1,248 patients 12 to 78 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis, 414 of whom received Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both trials, the antihistaminic efficacy of Aerinaze tablets as measured by total symptom score, excluding nasal congestion, was significantly greater than pseudoephedrine alone over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">In addition, the decongestant efficacy of Aerinaze tablets, as measured by nasal stuffiness/ congestion, was significantly greater than desloratadine alone over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">There were no significant differences in the efficacy of Aerinaze tablets across subgroups of patients defined by gender, age, or race.</seg>
<seg id="1697">7 In a single dose pharmacokinetic study with Aerinaze, plasma concentration of desloratadine can be detected within 30 minutes of administration.</seg>
<seg id="1698">Following oral administration of Aerinaze for 14 days in normal healthy volunteers, steady-state conditions were reached on day 10 for desloratadine, 3-hydroxydesloratadine and pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In a multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study conducted with the tablet formulation in healthy adult subjects, four subjects were found to be poor metabolisers of desloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study demonstrated that the exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrine following administration of pseudoephedrine alone was bioequivalent to pseudoephedrine exposure following administration of the Aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">However, non-clinical data with desloratadine reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and toxicity to reproduction.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination was not more toxic than their individual components, and observed effects were generally related to the pseudoephedrine component.</seg>
<seg id="1703">During reproductive toxicity studies, the combination of loratadine/ pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic when administered orally to rats at doses up to 150 mg/ kg/ day and rabbits at doses up to 120 mg/ kg/ day.</seg>

<seg id="1705">Antihistamines help to reduce allergic symptoms by preventing the effects of a substance called histamine, which is produced by the body.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerinaze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), such as, sneezing, runny or itchy nose, and eyes, when accompanied by nasal congestion.</seg>
<seg id="1707">Take special care with Aerinaze Certain conditions may make you unusually sensitive to the decongestant pseudoephedrine contained in this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1708">(sugar diabetes), stenosing peptic ulcer (ulcer leading to the narrowing of the stomach, small intestine or esophagus), pyloral or duodenal blockage (intestine blockage), vesical cervix blockage</seg>
<seg id="1709">Tell your doctor if you experience or are diagnosed with any of the following: • high blood pressure • a fast or pounding heart beat • abnormal heart rhythm • feeling sick and headache or increase headache while using Aerinaze.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Taking other medicines Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Driving and using machines At the recommended dose, Aerinaze is not expected to cause you to be drowsy or less alert.</seg>
<seg id="1712">If you take more Aerinaze than you should If you take more Aerinaze than you were told to, tell your doctor or pharmacist immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1713">If you forget to take Aerinaze If you forget to take your dose on time, take it as soon as possible and then go back to your regular dosing schedule.</seg>
<seg id="1714">Contact a doctor or pharmacist if you have any reaction at all to Aerinaze that continues, is bothersome or that you think is serious.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Common (at least 1 in 100 patients) side effects associated with Aerinaze include: fast heartbeat, restlessness with increased body movement, dry mouth, dizziness, sore throat, decreased appetite, constipation, sugar in urine, increased sugar in blood, thirst, tiredness, headache, trouble sleeping, nervousness, and drowsiness.</seg>
<seg id="1716">Uncommon (at least 1 in 1,000 patients) side effects include: pounding or irregular heart beat, increased body movement, flushing, hot flushes, confusion, blurry vision, dry eyes, nose bleeds, irritated nose, inflammation of the nose, runny nose, inflammation of the sinus, dry throat, stomach pain, stomach flu, nausea, abnormal stool, painful or difficult urination, problems urinating, changes in frequency of urination, itching, chills, decreased sense of smell, abnormal liver function tests, agitation, anxiety, and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="1717">During the marketing of desloratadine, cases of severe allergic reactions (difficulty in breathing, wheezing, itching, hives and swelling) and rash have been reported very rarely.</seg>
<seg id="1718">Cases of palpitations, rapid heartbeat, stomach pain, nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, upset stomach, diarrhoea, hallucinations, dizziness, drowsiness, inability to sleep, muscle pain, seizures, restlessness with increased body movement, liver inflammation and abnormal liver function tests have also been reported very rarely.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as a 5 mg tablet, a 5 mg oral lyophilisate (dispersible tablet), 2.5 mg and 5 mg orodispersible tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), a 0.5 mg/ ml syrup and a 0.5 mg/ ml oral solution.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children from one to five years of age, the dose is 1.25 mg once a day, taken as 2.5 ml syrup or oral solution.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children from six to 11 years of age, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, taken either as 5 ml of the syrup or oral solution, or as one 2.5 mg orodispersible tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius has been studied in a total of eight studies involving about 4,800 adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis (including four studies in seasonal allergic rhinitis, and two studies in patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness was measured by looking at the change in the symptoms (itching, number and size of hives, interference with sleep and daytime function) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Additional studies were presented to show that the syrup, oral solution and orodispersible tablets are treated by the body in the same way as the tablets, and to show that they can be used safely in children.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In allergic rhinitis, looking at the results of all studies taken together, two weeks of treatment with 5 mg Aerius led to an average decrease in symptom score of 25 to 32%, compared with a decrease of 12 to 26% in the patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies in urticaria, the decrease in symptom score after six weeks of treatment with Aerius was 58 and 67%, compared with 40 and 33% in placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadine, loratadine or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Aerius to SP Europe on 15 January 2001.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Adults and adolescents (12 years of age and over): one tablet once a day, with or without a meal for the relief of symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited clinical trial efficacy experience with the use of desloratadine in adolescents 12 through 17 years of age (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">Intermittent allergic rhinitis (presence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or for less than 4 weeks) should be managed in accordance with the evaluation of patient’ s disease history and the treatment could be discontinued after symptoms are resolved and reinitiated upon their reappearance.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In persistent allergic rhinitis (presence of symptoms for 4 days or more per week and for more than 4 weeks), continued treatment may be proposed to the patients during the allergen exposure periods.</seg>
<seg id="1733">No clinically relevant interactions were observed in clinical trials with desloratadine tablets in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were co-administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacology trial Aerius taken concomitantly with alcohol did not potentiate the performance impairing effects of alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that very rarely some people experience drowsiness, which may affect their ability to drive or use machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in a range of indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily, undesirable effects with Aerius were reported in 3% of patients in excess of those treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most frequent of adverse events reported in excess of placebo were fatigue (1.2%), dry mouth (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical trial with 578 adolescent patients, 12 through 17 years of age, the most common adverse event was headache; this occurred in 5.9% of patients treated with desloratadine and 6.9% of patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">Based on a multiple dose clinical trial, in which up to 45 mg of desloratadine was administered (nine times the clinical dose), no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">These include inhibiting the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-13 from human mast cells/ basophils, as well as inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecule P-selectin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">In a multiple dose clinical trial, in which up to 20 mg of desloratadine was administered daily for 14 days, no statistically or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacology trial, in which desloratadine was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily (nine times the clinical dose) for ten days, no prolongation of QTc interval was seen.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study performed in adults, desloratadine 5 mg did not affect standard measures of flight performance including exacerbation of subjective sleepiness or tasks related to flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in relieving symptoms such as sneezing, nasal discharge and itching, as well as ocular itching, tearing and redness, and itching of palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classifications of seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can alternatively be classified as intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis according to the duration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the presence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or for less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the presence of symptoms for 4 days or more per week and for more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">Aerius was effective in alleviating the burden of seasonal allergic rhinitis as shown by the total score of the rhino-conjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Chronic idiopathic urticaria was studied as a clinical model for urticarial conditions, since the underlying pathophysiology is similar, regardless of etiology, and because chronic patients can be more easily recruited prospectively.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since histamine release is a causal factor in all urticarial diseases, desloratadine is expected to be effective in providing symptomatic relief for other urticarial conditions, in addition to chronic idiopathic urticaria, as advised in clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">4 In two placebo-controlled six week trials in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in relieving pruritus and decreasing the size and number of hives by the end of the first dosing interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As with other antihistamine trials in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who were identified as non- responsive to antihistamines was excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement in pruritus of more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with desloratadine compared with 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius also significantly reduced interference with sleep and daytime function, as measured by a four-point scale used to assess these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic trial in which patient demographics were comparable to those of the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of the subjects achieved a higher concentration of desloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There is no evidence of clinically relevant medicine accumulation following once daily dosing of desloratadine (5 mg to 20 mg) for 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadine has not been identified yet, and therefore, some interactions with other medicinal products can not be fully excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadine does not inhibit CYP3A4 in vivo, and in vitro studies have shown that the medicinal product does not inhibit CYP2D6 and is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose trial using a 7.5 mg dose of desloratadine, there was no effect of food (high-fat, high caloric breakfast) on the disposition of desloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1760">Non-clinical studies conducted with desloratadine and loratadine demonstrated that there are no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxicity profile of desloratadine and loratadine at comparable levels of exposure to desloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Non-clinical data with desloratadine reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and toxicity to reproduction.</seg>
<seg id="1762">Tablet coating: film coat (containing lactose monohydrate, hypromellose, titanium dioxide, macrogol 400, indigotin (E132)), clear coat (containing hypromellose, macrogol 400), carnauba wax, white wax.</seg>
<seg id="1763">Aerius may be taken without regard to mealtime for the relief of symptoms associated with allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescriber should be aware that most cases of rhinitis below 2 years of age are of infectious origin (see section 4.4) and there are no data supporting the treatment of infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">The absence of upper respiratory tract infection or structural abnormalities, as well as patient history, physical examinations, and appropriate laboratory and skin tests should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Approximately 6% of adults and children 2- to 11-year old are phenotypic poor metabolisers of desloratadine and exhibit a higher exposure (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children 2- to 11-years of age who are poor metabolisers is the same as in children who are normal metabolisers.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicinal product contains sucrose and sorbitol; thus, patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">No clinically relevant interactions were observed in clinical trials with Aerius tablets in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were co-administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical pharmacology trial, Aerius tablets taken concomitantly with alcohol did not potentiate the performance impairing effects of alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall incidence of adverse events in children 2 through 11 years of age was similar for the Aerius syrup and the placebo groups.</seg>
<seg id="1772">At the recommended dose, in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in a range of indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, undesirable effects with Aerius were reported in 3% of patients in excess of those treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">Based on a multiple dose clinical trial in adults and adolescents, in which up to 45 mg of desloratadine was administered (nine times the clinical dose), no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children, 1-11 years of age, who were candidates for antihistamine therapy received a daily desloratadine dose of 1.25 mg (1 through 5 years of age) or 2.5 mg (6 through 11 years of age).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Thus, since the course of allergic rhinitis/ chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of desloratadine are similar in adults and paediatric patients, desloratadine efficacy data in adults can be extrapolated to the paediatric population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">In a multiple dose clinical trial, in adults and adolescents, in which up to 20 mg of desloratadine was administered daily for 14 days, no statistically or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical pharmacology trial, in adults and adolescents, in which desloratadine was administered to adults at a dose of 45 mg daily (nine times the clinical dose) for ten days, no prolongation of QTc interval was seen.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical trials, at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents, there was no excess incidence of</seg>
<seg id="1779">Aerius tablets given at a single daily dose of 7.5 mg to adults and adolescents did not affect psychomotor performance in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="1780">In clinical pharmacology trials in adults, co-administration with alcohol did not increase the alcohol- induced impairment in performance or increase in sleepiness.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in relieving symptoms such as sneezing, nasal discharge and itching, as well as ocular itching, tearing and redness, and itching of palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Aerius tablets were effective in alleviating the burden of seasonal allergic rhinitis as shown by the total score of the rhino-conjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire.</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled six week trials in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in relieving pruritus and decreasing the size and number of hives by the end of the first dosing interval.</seg>
<seg id="1784">11 paediatric subjects 2- to 11-year old (6%), and greater among Blacks (18% adult, 16% paediatric) than Caucasians (2% adult, 3% paediatric) in both populations.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study conducted with the syrup formulation in paediatric poor metaboliser subjects 2- to 11-year old diagnosed with allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1786">The exposure (AUC) to desloratadine was about 6-fold higher and the Cmax was about 3 to 4 fold higher at 3-6 hours with a terminal half-life of approximately 120 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1787">There is no evidence of clinically relevant active substance accumulation following once daily adult and adolescent dosing of desloratadine (5 mg to 20 mg) for 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1788">In separate single dose studies, at the recommended doses, paediatric patients had comparable AUC and Cmax values of desloratadine to those in adults who received a 5 mg dose of desloratadine syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1789">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadine has not been identified yet, and therefore, some interactions with other medicinal products can not be fully excluded.</seg>

<seg id="1893">On 13 June 2008, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S. r. l. officially notified the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that it wishes to withdraw its application for a marketing authorisation for Aflunov, for the prophylaxis of H5N1 avian influenza in adults and the elderly.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov was expected to be used in adults and the elderly to protect against flu caused by the H5N1 strain (type) of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that is intended to protect against a strain of flu that may cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic happens when a new strain of flu virus appears that can spread easily from person to person because people have no immunity (protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system recognises the parts of the flu virus it contains as ‘ foreign’ and makes antibodies against them.</seg>
<seg id="1898">The immune system will be able to produce antibodies more quickly when it is exposed to flu virus of the same strain.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Then, the outer membranes that contain the ‘ surface antigens’ (proteins on the outer membrane of the virus that the body recognises as foreign) were extracted and purified before being included in the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">An inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study had not been conducted in compliance with ‘ good clinical practice’ (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the size of the clinical database for the assessment of the vaccine’ s safety was not sufficient to fulfil the requirements of the EMEA’ s guidelines on prepandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">If you are in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment, contact the doctor who is giving it to you.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines to treat adults and children over four years of age who are infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), a virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">Although Agenerase oral solution is available for patients who cannot swallow the capsules, it cannot be given with ritonavir because the safety of this combination has not been assessed.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Doctors should prescribe Agenerase after they have looked at the antiviral medicines the patient has taken before and the likelihood that the virus will respond to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over 12 years of age is 600 mg twice a day, taken with 100 mg ritonavir twice a day and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children aged between four and 12 years and in patients who weigh less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenerase depends on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Agenerase, taken in combination with other antiviral medicines, reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Agenerase does not cure HIV infection or AIDS, but it may delay the damage to the immune system and the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase, in combination with other antiviral medicines but without ritonavir, has been studied in two main studies including 736 HIV-infected adults who had not previously been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">Agenerase boosted with low-dose ritonavir has been compared with other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who had taken protease inhibitors in the past.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main measures of effectiveness were the proportion of patients with undetectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change in viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies of patients who had not previously taken protease inhibitors, more patients taking Agenerase had viral loads below 400 copies/ ml than those taking placebo after 48 weeks, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">Agenerase also reduced viral loads in children, although very few of the children who had taken protease inhibitors in the past responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study of adults who had taken protease inhibitors in the past, Agenerase boosted with ritonavir was as effective as other protease inhibitors in reducing viral loads after 16 weeks of treatment: around two thirds of the patients in both groups had viral loads below 400 copies/ ml.</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV that was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, patients taking Agenerase with ritonavir had a greater fall in viral load after four weeks than those continuing to take their previous protease inhibitors: half of those taking Agenerase with ritonavir had viral loads below 400 copies/ ml, compared with none of those continuing to take their previous protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects with Agenerase (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are headache, diarrhoea, flatulence (gas), nausea (feeling sick), vomiting, rash and fatigue (tiredness).</seg>
<seg id="1919">Agenerase should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amprenavir or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase must not be used in patients who are taking St John’ s wort (a herbal preparation used to treat depression) or medicines that are broken down in the same way as Agenerase and are harmful at high levels in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other anti-HIV medicines, patients taking Agenerase may be at risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue) or immune reactivation syndrome (symptoms of infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Agenerase’ s benefits are greater than its risks for use in combination with other antiretroviral agents in the treatment of protease inhibitor experienced HIV-1 infected adults and children above the age of four years.</seg>
<seg id="1923">It is normally taken with the pharmacokinetic enhancer ritonavir, but the Committee noted that the benefit of Agenerase taken with ritonavir has not been demonstrated in patients who have not taken protease inhibitors in the past.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Agenerase was originally authorised under ‘ Exceptional Circumstances’, because, for scientific reasons, limited information was available at the time of approval.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Agenerase to Glaxo Group Limited on 20 October 2000.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase, in combination with other antiretroviral agents, is indicated for the treatment of protease inhibitor (PI) experienced HIV-1 infected adults and children above the age of 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Agenerase capsules should normally be administered with low dose ritonavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer of amprenavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The choice of amprenavir should be based on individual viral resistance testing and treatment history of patients (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">Amprenavir is 14% less bioavailable from the oral solution than from the capsules; therefore, Agenerase capsules and Agenerase oral solution are not interchangeable on a milligram per milligram basis (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">Adults and adolescents of 12 years of age and older (greater than 50 kg body weight): the recommended dose of Agenerase capsules is 600 mg twice daily with ritonavir, 100 mg twice daily, in combination with other antiretroviral agents.</seg>
<seg id="1931">If Agenerase capsules are used without the boosting effect of ritonavir higher doses of Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) should be used.</seg>
<seg id="1932">2 Children (4 to 12 years) and patients less than 50 kg body weight: the recommended dose of Agenerase capsules is 20 mg/ kg body weight twice a day, in combination with other antiretroviral agents, without exceeding a total daily dose of 2400 mg (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of Agenerase in combination with low doses of ritonavir or other protease inhibitors have not yet been evaluated in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended in children below 4 years due to lack of data on safety and efficacy (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice a day for adult patients with moderate hepatic impairment and to 300 mg twice a day for adult patients with severe hepatic impairment.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Concomitant administration should be used with caution in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment and is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase must not be administered concurrently with medicinal products with narrow therapeutic windows that are substrates of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St John’ s wort (Hypericum perforatum) must not be used while taking amprenavir due to the risk of decreased plasma concentrations and reduced clinical effects of amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Agenerase, or any other current antiretroviral therapy does not cure HIV and that they may still develop opportunistic infections and other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">Current antiretroviral therapies, including Agenerase, have not been proven to prevent the risk of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or blood contamination.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Agenerase capsules should normally be given in combination with low dose ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral agents (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with combination antiretroviral therapy are at an increased risk of severe and potentially fatal hepatic adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1943">In case of concomitant antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or C, please refer also to the relevant product information for these medicinal products.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction, including chronic active hepatitis, have an increased frequency of liver function abnormalities during combination antiretroviral therapy and should be monitored according to standard practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Concomitant use of Agenerase with ritonavir and fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolised by CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects, including Cushing’ s syndrome and adrenal suppression (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors lovastatin and simvastatin are highly dependent on CYP3A4 for metabolism, thus concomitant use of Agenerase with simvastatin or lovastatin is not recommended due to an increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">For some medicinal products that can cause serious or life-threatening undesirable effects, such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (monitor International Normalised Ratio), concentration monitoring is available; this should minimise the risk of potential safety problems with concomitant use.</seg>
<seg id="1948">Agenerase may be less effective due to decreased amprenavir plasma concentrations in patients taking these medicinal products concomitantly (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Because of the potential for metabolic interactions with amprenavir, the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be modified, but there is insufficient information to predict the nature of the interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">Therefore, when methadone is co-administered with amprenavir, patients should be monitored for opiate abstinence syndrome, in particular if low-dose ritonavir is also given.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the potential risk of toxicity from the high propylene glycol content of Agenerase oral solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children below the age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient populations.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be permanently discontinued when rash is accompanied with systemic symptoms or allergic symptoms or mucosal involvement (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">New onset of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycaemia or exacerbations of existing diabetes mellitus have been reported in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy, including protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had confounding medical conditions, some of which required therapy with agents that have been associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">A higher risk of lipodystrophy has been associated with individual factors such as older age, and with drug related factors such as longer duration of antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disturbances.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There have been reports of increased bleeding, including spontaneous skin haematomas and haemarthroses, in haemophiliac patients type A and B treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of institution of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic pathogens may arise and cause serious clinical conditions, or aggravation of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although the etiology is considered to be multifactorial (including corticosteroid use, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonecrosis have been reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV-disease and/ or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic index Agenerase must not be administered concurrently with medicinal products with narrow therapeutic windows containing active substances that are substrates of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with narrow therapeutic index Agenerase with ritonavir must not be co-administered with medicinal products containing active substances that are highly dependent on CYP2D6 metabolism and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and / or life-threatening adverse reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1961">6 Rifampicin is a strong CYP3A4 inducer and has been shown to cause an 82% decrease in amprenavir AUC, which can result in virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">During attempts to overcome the decreased exposure by increasing the dose of other protease inhibitors with ritonavir, a high frequency of liver reactions was seen.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St John’ s wort (Hypericum perforatum) Serum levels of amprenavir can be reduced by concomitant use of the herbal preparation St John’ s wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient is already taking St John’ s wort, check amprenavir and if possible viral levels and stop St John’ s wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">No dose adjustment is necessary for either medicinal product when nelfinavir is administered in combination with amprenavir (see also efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">Ritonavir: the AUC and Cmin of amprenavir were increased by 64% and 508% respectively and the Cmax decreased by 30% when ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was co-administered with amprenavir capsule (600 mg twice daily) compared to values achieved after 1200 mg twice daily doses of amprenavir capsules.</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of amprenavir 600 mg twice daily and ritonavir 100 mg twice daily have been used; confirming the safety and efficacy of this regimen.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Lopinavir / ritonavir (Kaletra): in an open-label, non-fasting pharmacokinetic study, the AUC, Cmax and Cmin of lopinavir were decreased by 38%, 28% and 52% respectively when amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) was given in combination with Kaletra (400 mg lopinavir + 100 mg ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The amprenavir plasma Cmin values achieved with the combination of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) in combination with Kaletra (400 mg lopinavir + 100 mg ritonavir twice daily) are approximately 40- 50% lower than when amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is given in combination with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">7 administration of amprenavir and Kaletra, but close monitoring is advised because the safety and efficacy of this combination is unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Didanosine: no pharmacokinetic study has been performed with Agenerase in combination with didanosine, however, due to its antacid component, it is recommended that didanosine and Agenerase should be administered at least one hour apart (see Antacids below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, if efavirenz is given in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), no dose adjustment is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended, as the exposure to both protease inhibitors would be decreased.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of nevirapine on other protease inhibitors and the limited evidence available suggest that nevirapine may decrease the serum concentrations of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these medicinal products are used concomitantly care is advised, as delavirdine may be less effective due to decreased and potentially sub-therapeutic plasma concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these medicinal products are used concomitantly care is advised, and close clinical and virological monitoring should be performed since it is difficult to predict the effect of the combination of amprenavir and ritonavir on delavirdine.</seg>
<seg id="1977">Rifabutin: co-administration of amprenavir with rifabutin resulted in a 193% increase in rifabutin AUC and an increase of rifabutin-related adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1978">When it is clinically necessary to co-administer rifabutin with Agenerase, a dosage reduction of at least half the recommended dose of rifabutin is advised, although no clinical data are available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Erythromycin: no pharmacokinetic study has been performed with Agenerase in combination with erythromycin, however, plasma levels of both medicinal products may be increased when co-administered.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Co- administration of fosamprenavir 700 mg with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily and ketoconazole 200 mg once daily increased plasma ketoconazole Cmax by 25% and increased AUC(0-τ) to values 2.69-fold those observed on administration of ketoconazole 200 mg once daily without concurrent fosamprenavir with ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicinal products, listed below, including examples of substrates, inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4, may lead to interactions when administered with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these medicinal products when these are administered in combination with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Antacids: on the basis of the data for other protease inhibitors, it is advisable not to take antacids at the same time as Agenerase, since its absorption may be impaired.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Anticonvulsant active substances: concomitant administration of anticonvulsant active substances known as enzymatic inductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine) with amprenavir may lead to a decrease in the plasma concentrations of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Calcium-channel blockers: amprenavir may lead to increased serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine, isradipine, nicardipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine and verapamil, possibly resulting in enhanced activity and toxicity of these medicinal products.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Co- administration with Agenerase may substantially increase PDE5 inhibitor plasma concentrations and associated adverse events, including hypotension, visual changes and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">9 Fluticasone propionate (interaction with ritonavir): in a clinical study where ritonavir 100 mg capsules bid were co-administered with 50 µg intranasal fluticasone propionate (4 times daily) for 7 days in healthy subjects, the fluticasone propionate plasma levels increased significantly, whereas the intrinsic cortisol levels decreased by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82-89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">Consequently, concomitant administration of Agenerase with ritonavir and these glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors which are highly dependent on CYP3A4 for metabolism, such as lovastatin and simvastatin, are expected to have markedly increased plasma concentrations when co-administered with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since increased concentrations of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may cause myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, the combination of these medicinal products with Agenerase is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">Immunosuppressants: frequent therapeutic concentration monitoring of immunosuppresant levels is recommended until levels have stabilised as plasma concentrations of cyclosporin, rapamycin and tacrolimus may be increased when co-administered with amprenavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore Agenerase should not be co-administered with orally administered midazolam (see section 4.3), whereas caution should be used with co-administration of Agenerase and parenteral midazolam.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data from concomitant use of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors suggest a possible 3-4 fold increase in midazolam plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1994">When methadone is co-administered with amprenavir, patients should be monitored for opiate abstinence syndrome, in particular if low-dose ritonavir is also given.</seg>
<seg id="1995">No recommendations can currently be made regarding adjustment of amprenavir dose when amprenavir is co-administered with methadone due to the inherent low reliability of non- matched historical controls.</seg>
<seg id="1996">10 Oral anticoagulants: a reinforced monitoring of the International Normalised Ratio is recommended in case of administration of Agenerase with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants, due to a possible decrease or increase of their antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">When ritonavir is co-administered, the effect on hormonal contraceptive concentrations cannot be predicted, therefore, alternative methods of contraception are also recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tricyclic antidepressants: careful monitoring of the therapeutic and adverse reactions of tricyclic antidepressants is recommended when they (for example desipramine and nortriptyline) are concomitantly administered with Agenerase (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This medicinal product should be used during pregnancy only after careful weighing of the potential benefits compared to the potential risk to the foetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">Lactation: amprenavir-related material was found in rat milk, but it is not known whether amprenavir is excreted in human milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study in pregnant rats dosed from the time of uterine implantation through lactation showed reduced body weight gains in the offspring during the nursing period.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The subsequent development of the offspring, including fertility and reproductive performance, was not affected by the maternal administration of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The safety of Agenerase has been studied in adults and children at least 4 years of age, in controlled clinical trials, in combination with various other antiretroviral agents.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most undesirable effects associated with Agenerase therapy were mild to moderate in severity, early in onset, and rarely treatment limiting.</seg>
<seg id="2005">For many of these events, it is unclear whether they are related to Agenerase, to concomitant treatment used in the management of HIV disease or to the disease process.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the adverse events below come from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006) involving PI naïve subjects receiving Agenerase 1200mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (grade 2-4) reported by study investigators as attributable to study medication and occurring in > 1% of patients, are included as well as grade 3-4 treatment emergent laboratory abnormalities.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Combination antiretroviral therapy has been associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients including the loss of peripheral and facial subcutaneous fat, increased intra-abdominal and visceral fat, breast hypertrophy and dorsocervical fat accumulation (buffalo hump).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Only one case (a buffalo hump) was reported in 113 (< 1%) antiretroviral naive subjects treated with amprenavir in combination with lamivudine/ zidovudine for a median duration of 36 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2010">In study PROAB3006, seven cases (3%) were reported in 245 NRTI-experienced subjects treated with amprenavir and in 27 (11%) of 241 subjects treated with indinavir, in combination with various NRTIs for a median duration of 56 weeks (p < 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Rashes were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or maculopapular cutaneous eruptions, with or without pruritus, occurring during the second week of therapy and resolving spontaneously within two weeks, without discontinuation of treatment with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, particularly in patients with generally acknowledged risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (CART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may arise (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">In PI experienced patients receiving Agenerase capsules 600 mg twice daily and low dose ritonavir, 100 mg twice daily, the nature and frequency of adverse events (grade 2-4) and Grade 3/ 4 laboratory abnormalities were similar to those observed with Agenerase alone, with the exception of elevated triglyceride levels, and elevated CPK levels which were very common in patients receiving Agenerase and low dose ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">If overdose occurs, the patient should be monitored for evidence of toxicity (see section 4.8) and standard supportive treatment provided as necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active site of HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the processing of viral gag and gag-pol polyprotein precursors, resulting in the formation of immature non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The in vitro antiviral activity of amprenavir was evaluated against HIV-1 IIIB in both acutely and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and in peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of amprenavir ranged from 0.012 to 0.08 µM in acutely infected cells and was 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells (1 µM = 0.50 µg/ ml).</seg>
<seg id="2019">The relationship between in vitro anti-HIV-1 activity of amprenavir and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans has not been defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">When ART naïve patients were treated with the currently approved doses of fosamprenavir/ ritonavir, as for other ritonavir boosted PI regimens, the mutations described were infrequently observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Sixteen of 434 ART-naïve patients who received fosamprenavir 700mg/ ritonavir 100mg twice daily in ESS100732 experienced virological failure by Week 48 with 14 isolates genotyped.</seg>
<seg id="2022">Genotypic analysis of isolates from 13 of 14 paediatric patients exhibiting virological failure among the 59 PI-naïve patients enrolled, demonstrated resistance patterns similar to those observed in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F/ I/ V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, M36I, M46I/ L, I47V, G48V, I50V, I54L/ M/ T/ V, Q58E, D60E, I62V, A71V, V77I, V82A/ I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L/ M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the studies of PI-experienced patients, APV30003 and its extension, APV30005 (fosamprenavir 700 mg / ritonavir 100 mg twice daily: n=107), the following mutations emerged in patients experiencing virological failure through 96 weeks:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypic interpretation systems may be used to estimate the activity of amprenavir / ritonavir or fosamprenavir / ritonavir in subjects with PI-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">L10F/ I/ V, L33F, M36I, I54A/ L/ M/ S/ T/ V, I62V, V82A/ C/ F/ G, I84V and L90M and is associated with increased phenotypic resistance to fosamprenavir with ritonavir as well as reduced likelihood of virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">Conclusions regarding the relevance of particular mutations or mutational patterns are subject to change with additional data, and it is recommended to always consult current interpretation systems for analysing resistance test results.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Clinically validated phenotypic interpretation systems may be used in association with the genotypic data to estimate the activity of amprenavir / ritonavir or fosamprenavir / ritonavir in patients with PI- resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Resistance testing diagnostic companies have developed clinical phenotypic cut-offs for FPV/ RTV that can be used to interpret resistance test results.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four genetic patterns associated with reduced susceptibility to amprenavir produces some cross-resistance to ritonavir but susceptibility to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir is generally retained.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on cross-resistance between amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 fosamprenavir resistance pathways, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on data from twenty-five antiretroviral naïve patients failing a fosamprenavir containing regimen (one of whom showed Baseline resistance to lopinavir and saquinavir and another to tipranavir) the resistance pathways associated with amprenavir produce limited cross-resistance to atazanavir/ ritonavir (three of 25 isolates), darunavir/ ritonavir (four of 25 isolates), indinavir/ ritonavir (one of 25 isolates), lopinavir/ ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), saquinavir (three of 24 isolates) and tipranavir/ ritonavir (four of 24 isolates)..</seg>
<seg id="2033">Conversely amprenavir retains activity against some isolates with resistance to other PIs and this retained activity would depend on the number and type of protease resistance mutations present in the isolates</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early discontinuation of failing therapies is recommended in order to limit the accumulation of multiple mutations, which may be detrimental to a subsequent rescue regimen.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of efficacy of Agenerase in combination with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on study PRO30017, a randomized, open-label study, in which PI-experienced adults experiencing virological failure (viral load ≥ 1000 copies/ ml) received either Agenerase (600 mg twice daily) in combination with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) and nucleoside analogues (NRTI) or a standard of care (SOC) PI, predominantly boosted with low-dose RTV.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-three (163) patients with virus sensitive to Agenerase, at least one other PI, and at least one NRTI were included in PRO30017 substudy A.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis assessed the non- inferiority of APV/ r to the SOC PI group with respect to time-weighted average change from baseline (AAUCMB) in plasma viral load (HIV-1 RNA) at week 16 using a non-inferiority margin of 0.4 log10 copies/ ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of efficacy of unboosted Agenerase was based on two uncontrolled clinical studies involving 288 HIV infected children aged between 2 and 18 years, 152 of whom were PI experienced.</seg>
<seg id="2039">The studies evaluated Agenerase oral solution and capsules at doses of 15 mg/ kg three times daily, 20 mg/ kg three times daily, 20 mg/ kg twice daily and 22.5 mg/ kg twice daily although the majority received 20 mg/ kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">Concomitant low dose ritonavir was not administered and the majority of the PI experienced subjects had prior exposure to at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs co-administered with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">At Week 48, approximately 25% of those enrolled had plasma HIV-1 RNA < 10,000 copies/ ml and 9% < 400 copies/ ml with a median change from baseline in CD4+ cells of 26 cells/ mm3 (n=74).</seg>
<seg id="2042">Based on these data, careful consideration should be given to the expected benefit of unboosted Agenerase when optimising therapy for PI experienced children.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Following oral administration, the mean time (tmax) to maximal serum concentrations of amprenavir is between 1-2 hours for the capsule and 0.5 to 1 hour for the oral solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">The AUC and Cmin of amprenavir were increased by 64% and 508% respectively and the Cmax decreased by 30% when ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was coadministered with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) compared to values achieved after 1200 mg twice daily doses of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2045">While administration of amprenavir with food results in a 25% reduction in AUC, it had no effect on the concentration of amprenavir 12 hours after dosing (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, although food affects the extent and rate of absorption, the steady-state trough concentration (Cmin, ss) was not affected by food intake.</seg>
<seg id="2047">Distribution: the apparent volume of distribution is approximately 430 litres (6 l/ kg assuming a 70 kg body weight), suggesting a large volume of distribution, with penetration of amprenavir freely into tissues beyond the systemic circulation.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change will decrease the total active substance concentration in the plasma, however the amount of unbound amprenavir, which is the active moiety, is likely to be unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While absolute free active substance concentrations remain constant, the percent of free active substance will fluctuate directly with total active substance concentrations at steady-state go from Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss over the course of the dosing interval.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicinal products that are inducers, inhibitors or substrates of CYP3A4 must be used with caution when administered concurrently with Agenerase (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">Dosages of 20 mg/ kg twice a day and 15 mg/ kg three times a day with Agenerase capsules provided similar daily amprenavir exposure to 1200 mg twice a day in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is 14% less bioavailable from the oral solution than from the capsules; therefore, Agenerase capsules and Agenerase oral solution are not interchangeable on a milligram per milligram basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Renal clearance of ritonavir is also negligible; therefore the impact of renal impairment on amprenavir and ritonavir elimination should be minimal.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These dosing regimens will provide plasma amprenavir levels comparable to those achieved in healthy subjects given a 1200 mg dose twice daily without concomitant administration of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term carcinogenicity studies with amprenavir in mice and rats, there were benign hepatocellular adenomas in males at exposure levels equivalent to 2.0-fold (mice) or 3.8-fold (rats) those in humans given 1200 mg twice daily of amprenavir alone.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The mechanism for the hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas found in these studies has not been elucidated and the significance of the observed effects for humans is uncertain.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, there is little evidence from the exposure data in humans, both in clinical trials and from marketed use, to suggest that these findings are of clinical significance.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Amprenavir was not mutagenic or genotoxic in a battery of in vivo and in vitro genetic toxicity assays, including bacterial reverse mutation (Ames Test), mouse lymphoma, rat micronucleus, and chromosome aberration in human peripheral lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored for and detected in clinical use, with measurements of AST, ALT and alkaline phosphatase activity.</seg>
<seg id="2060">However, significant liver toxicity has not been observed in patients treated in clinical studies, either during administration of Agenerase or after discontinuation.</seg>
<seg id="2061">19 Toxicity studies in young animals, treated from four days of age, resulted in high mortality in both the control animals and those receiving amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">However, at systemic plasma exposures significantly below (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rat) than the expected human exposures during therapeutic dosing, a number of minor changes, including thymic elongation and minor skeletal variations were seen, indicating developmental delay.</seg>
<seg id="2063">If Agenerase capsules are used without the boosting effect of ritonavir higher doses of Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2064">22 Children (4 to 12 years) and patients less than 50 kg body weight: the recommended dose of Agenerase capsules is 20 mg/ kg body weight twice a day, in combination with other antiretroviral agents, without exceeding a total daily dose of 2400 mg (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Concomitant administration should be used with caution in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment and is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">For some medicinal products that can cause serious or life-threatening undesirable effects, such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (monitor International Normalised Ratio), concentration monitoring is available; this should minimise the risk of potential safety problems with concomitant use.</seg>
<seg id="2067">Agenerase should be permanently discontinued when rash is accompanied with systemic symptoms or allergic symptoms or mucosal involvement (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2068">A higher risk of lipodystrophy has been associated with individual factors such as older age, and with drug related factors such as longer duration of antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disturbances.</seg>
<seg id="2069">26 Rifampicin Rifampicin is a strong CYP3A4 inducer and has been shown to cause an 82% decrease in amprenavir AUC, which can result in virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="2070">Ritonavir: the AUC and Cmin of amprenavir were increased by 64% and 508% respectively and the Cmax decreased by 30% when ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was coadministered with amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily) compared to values achieved after 1200 mg twice daily doses of amprenavir capsules.</seg>
<seg id="2071">The amprenavir plasma Cmin values achieved with the combination of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) in combination with Kaletra (400 mg lopinavir + 100 mg ritonavir twice daily) are approximately 40- 50% lower than when amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is given in combination with ritonavir 100 mg</seg>
<seg id="2072">No dose recommendation can be given for the co- administration of amprenavir and Kaletra, but close monitoring is advised because the safety and efficacy of this combination is unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Treatment with efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure to both protease inhibitors would be decreased.</seg>
<seg id="2074">28 close clinical and virological monitoring should be performed since it is difficult to predict the effect of the combination of amprenavir and ritonavir on delavirdine.</seg>
<seg id="2075">When it is clinically necessary to co-administer rifabutin with Agenerase, a dosage reduction of at least half the recommended dose of rifabutin is advised, although no clinical data are available.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Calcium-channel blockers: amprenavir may lead to increased serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine, isradipine, nicardipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine and verapamil, possibly resulting in enhanced activity and toxicity of these medicinal products.</seg>
<seg id="2077">Fluticasone propionate (interaction with ritonavir): in a clinical study where ritonavir 100 mg capsules bid were co-administered with 50 µg intranasal fluticasone propionate (4 times daily) for 7 days in healthy subjects, the fluticasone propionate plasma levels increased significantly, whereas the intrinsic cortisol levels decreased by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82-89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">Oral anticoagulants: a reinforced monitoring of the International Normalised Ratio is recommended in case of administration of Agenerase with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants, due to a possible decrease or increase of their antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">Co-administration of 0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol plus 1.0 mg norethindrone resulted in a decrease of the amprenavir AUC and Cmin of 22% and 20% respectively, Cmax being unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2080">This medicinal product should be used during pregnancy only after careful weighing of the potential benefits compared to the potential risk to the foetus.</seg>
<seg id="2081">A reproduction study in pregnant rats dosed from the time of uterine implantation through lactation showed reduced body weight gains in the offspring during the nursing period.</seg>
<seg id="2082">The safety of Agenerase has been studied in adults and children of at least 4 years of age, in controlled clinical trials, in combination with various other antiretroviral agents.</seg>

<seg id="2095">Toxicity studies in young animals, treated from four days of age, resulted in high mortality in both the control animals and those receiving amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2096">These results imply that young animals lack fully developed metabolic pathways enabling them to excrete amprenavir or some critical components of the formulation (e. g. propylene glycol, PEG400).</seg>
<seg id="2097">Agenerase oral solution, in combination with other antiretroviral agents, is indicated for the treatment of protease inhibitor (PI) experienced HIV-1 infected adults and children above the age of 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="2098">The benefit of Agenerase oral solution boosted with ritonavir has not been demonstrated either in PI naïve patients or in PI experienced patients.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Amprenavir is 14% less bioavailable from the Agenerase oral solution than from the capsules; therefore, Agenerase capsules and Agenerase oral solution are not interchangeable on a milligram per milligram basis (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2100">Patients should discontinue Agenerase oral solution as soon as they are able to swallow the capsule formulation (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2101">Patients of 4 years and older unable to swallow Agenerase capsules: the recommended dose of Agenerase oral solution is 17 mg (1.1 ml)/ kg three times a day, in combination with other antiretroviral agents, without exceeding a total daily dose of 2800 mg (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2102">Additionally, as no dosing recommendations can be made regarding the concomitant use of Agenerase oral solution and low dose ritonavir, the use of this combination must be avoided in these patient populations.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Renal impairment: although no dose adjustment is considered necessary for amprenavir, Agenerase oral solution is contraindicated in patients with renal failure (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2104">Because of the potential risk of toxicity from the large amount of the excipient propylene glycol, Agenerase oral solution is contraindicated in infants and children below the age of 4 years, pregnant women, patients with hepatic impairment or failure and patients with renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="2105">Co-administration may result in competitive inhibition of the metabolism of these medicinal products and create the potential for serious and/ or life-threatening adverse events such as cardiac arrhythmia (e. g. amiodarone, bepridil, quinidine, terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, pimozide), respiratory depression and / or prolonged sedation (e. g. oral triazolam and oral midazolam (for caution on parenterally administred midazolam, see section 4.5)) or peripheral vasospasm or ischaemia and ischaemia of other tissues, including cerebral or myocardial ischaemia (e. g. ergot derivatives).</seg>

<seg id="2174">The number of times Aldara is applied and the duration of treatment depend on the condition being treated: • For genital warts, Aldara is applied three times a week for up to 16 weeks. • For small basal cell carcinomas, the cream is applied five times a week for six weeks. • For actinic keratoses, it is applied three times a week, for one or two four-week courses, with four weeks between courses.</seg>
<seg id="2175">The cream is applied in a thin layer to the affected areas of skin before sleeping, so that it remains on the skin for a suitable length of time (about eight hours) before being washed off.</seg>
<seg id="2176">In all studies, Aldara was compared with placebo (the same cream but without the active substance). • Aldara has been studied in 923 patients with genital warts in four main studies lasting 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2177">The main measure of effectiveness was the number of patients with total clearance of treated warts. • Aldara has also been studied in 724 patients with small basal cell carcinomas in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks, and used Aldara or placebo either five times a week or every day.</seg>
<seg id="2178">The main measure of effectiveness was the number of patients with total clearance of the tumours after 12 weeks. • Aldara has also been studied in patients with actinic keratoses in two studies involving a total of 505 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2179">In all studies, Aldara was more effective than placebo. • In the treatment of genital warts, the total clearance rate across the four main studies was 15 to 52% in the Aldara-treated patients, compared with 3 to 18% in the placebo-treated patients. • When the results of the two studies in basal cell carcinoma were looked at together, total clearance was seen in 66 to 80% of Aldara-treated patients compared with 0 to 3% in the placebo group.</seg>

<seg id="2194">While limited data have shown an increased rate of wart reduction in HIV positive patients, imiquimod cream has not been shown to be as effective in terms of wart clearance in this patient group.</seg>
<seg id="2195">Imiquimod has not been evaluated for the treatment of basal cell carcinoma within 1 cm of the eyelids, nose, lips or hairline.</seg>
<seg id="2196">Local skin reactions are common but these reactions generally decrease in intensity during therapy or resolve after cessation of imiquimod cream therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2197">If required by the patient’s discomfort or the severity of the local skin reaction, a rest period of several days may be taken.</seg>
<seg id="2198">5 The clinical outcome of therapy can be determined after regeneration of the treated skin, approximately 12 weeks after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2199">As data on long-term clearance rates beyond 36 months post-treatment are not currently available, other appropriate therapeutic modalities should be considered for sBCC.</seg>
<seg id="2200">No clinical experience exists in patients with recurrent and previously treated BCCs, therefore use for previously treated tumours is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2201">Data from an open label clinical trial suggest that large tumours (> 7.25 cm2) are less likely to respond to imiquimod therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2202">Imiquimod has not been evaluated for the treatment of actinic keratoses on the eyelids, the inside of the nostrils or ears, or the lip area inside the vermilion border.</seg>
<seg id="2203">There are very limited data available on the use of imiquimod for the treatment of actinic keratoses in anatomical locations other than the face and scalp.</seg>

<seg id="2207">Data from an open-label clinical trial suggest that subjects with more than 8 AK lesions showed a decreased rate of complete clearance compared to patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to its immunostimulating properties, imiquimod cream should be used with caution in patients who are receiving immunosuppressive medication (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>

<seg id="2216">These protocol mandated clinical sign assessments indicate that local skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), excoriation/flaking/scaling (23%) and oedema (14%) were common in these placebo controlled clinical trials with imiquimod cream applied three times weekly (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">These protocol mandated clinical sign assessments indicate that severe erythema (31%) severe erosions (13%) and severe scabbing and crusting (19%) were very common in these trials with imiquimod cream applied 5 times weekly.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Clinical studies investigating the use of imiquimod for the treatment of actinic keratosis have detected a 0.4% (5/1214) frequency of alopecia at the treatment site or surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Following accidental ingestion, nausea, emesis, headache, myalgia and fever could occur after a single dose of 200 mg imiquimod which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 sachets.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The most clinically serious adverse event reported following multiple oral doses of ≥ 200 mg was hypotension which resolved following oral or intravenous fluid administration.</seg>
<seg id="2221">Increases in systemic levels of alpha interferon and other cytokines following topical application of imiquimod were demonstrated in a pharmacokinetic study.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The results of 3 phase III pivotal efficacy studies showed that treatment with imiquimod for sixteen weeks was significantly more effective than treatment with vehicle as measured by total clearance of treated warts.</seg>

<seg id="2232">Aldara Cream has been evaluated in four randomised, vehicle controlled, double-blind trials in children aged 2 to 15 years with molluscum contagiosum (imiquimod n = 576, vehicle n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">These trials failed to demonstrate efficacy of imiquimod at any of the tested dosage regimens (3x/week for ≤16 weeks and 7x/week for ≤8 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2234">Minimal systemic absorption of imiquimod 5% cream across the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratosis was observed with 3 times per week dosing for 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">Peak serum drug concentrations at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and were 0.1, 0.2, and 1.6 ng/mL for the applications to face (12.5 mg, 1 single-use sachet), scalp (25 mg, 2 sachets) and hands/arms (75 mg, 6 sachets), respectively.</seg>
<seg id="2236">An apparent half-life was calculated that was approximately 10 times greater than the 2 hour half-life seen following subcutaneous dosing in a previous study, suggesting prolonged retention of drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The systemic exposure data demonstrated that the extent of absorption of imiquimod following topical application to the MC lesional skin of the paediatric patients aged 6-12 years was low and comparable to that observed in healthy adults and adults with actinic keratosis or superficial basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month rat dermal toxicity study, significantly decreased body weight and increased spleen weight were observed at 0.5 and 2.5 mg/kg; similar effects were not seen in a four month mouse dermal study.</seg>
<seg id="2239">13 A two-year mouse carcinogenicity study by dermal administration on three days a week did not induce tumours at the application site.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The mechanism for this is not known, but as imiquimod has low systemic absorption from human skin, and is not mutagenic, any risk to humans from systemic exposure is likely to be low.</seg>

<seg id="2280">In patients under five years of age, the very common side effects are increased blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation (a measure of lung function), tachycardia (fast heart rate), pyrexia and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme should not be used in people who may have a severe allergic reaction (anaphylactic reaction) to laronidase or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2282">Every year, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information that may become available and this summary will be updated as necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The company that makes Aldurazyme will monitor patients receiving Aldurazyme, looking at reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Aldurazyme to Genzyme Europe B. V. on 10 June 2003.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-iduronidase and is produced by recombinant DNA technology using mammalian Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell culture.</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non- neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Aldurazyme treatment should be supervised by a physician experienced in the management of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 U/ kg/ h may be incrementally increased every fifteen minutes, if tolerated, to a maximum of 43 U/ kg/ h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients older than 65 years have not been established and no dosage regimen can be recommended in these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency have not been evaluated and no dosage regimen can be recommended in these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme may develop infusion-associated reactions (IARs), defined as any related adverse event occurring during the infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">Severe infusion associated reactions have been reported in patients with pre-existent severe underlying upper airway involvement and therefore specifically these patients should continue to be closely monitored and only be infused with Aldurazyme in an appropriate clinical setting where resuscitation equipment to manage medical emergencies would be readily available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Based on the Phase 3 clinical trial, almost all patients are expected to develop IgG antibodies to laronidase, mostly within 3 months of initiation of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who have developed antibodies or symptoms of IARs should be treated with caution when administering Aldurazyme (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">As there is little experience on resumption of treatment following prolonged interruption, use caution due to the theoretical increased risk of hypersensitivity reaction after treatment interruption.</seg>
<seg id="2296">With initial administration of Aldurazyme or upon re-administration following interruption of treatment, it is recommended that patients be administered pretreatment medicines(antihistamines and/ or antipyretics) approximately 60 minutes prior to the start of the infusion, to minimise the potential occurrence of IARs.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of a mild or moderate IAR, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol/ ibuprofen should be considered and/ or a reduction in the infusion rate to half the infusion rate at which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single severe IAR, the infusion should be stopped until the symptoms are resolved and treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol/ ibuprofen should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">The infusion can be restarted with a reduction of the infusion rate to 1/ 2 – 1/ 4 the rate of the infusion at which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">In case of a recurrent moderate IAR or re-challenge after a single severe IAR, pretreatment should be considered (antihistamines and paracetamol/ ibuprofen and/ or corticosteroids) and a reduction of the infusion rate to 1/ 2 – 1/ 4 the rate of the infusion at which the previous reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be administered simultaneously with chloroquine or procaine due to a potential risk of interference with the intracellular uptake of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, parturition and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Because there are no data available in neonates exposed to laronidase via breast milk, it is recommended to stop breast-feeding during Aldurazyme treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The majority of the related adverse events in the clinical trials were classified as infusion-associated reactions (IARs), experienced by 53% of the patients in the Phase 3 study (treated for up to 4 years) and 35% of the patients in the under 5 study (up to 1 year of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="2305">ADRs to Aldurazyme reported during the Phase 3 study and its extension in a total of 45 patients age 5 years and older and treated up to 4 years are listed below using the following categories of frequency: very common (≥ 1/ 10); common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">Additionally, a few patients who had a prior history of severe MPS I- related upper airway and pulmonary involvement, experienced severe reactions including bronchospasm, respiratory arrest, and facial oedema (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Paediatric population ADRs to Aldurazyme reported during a Phase 2 study in a total of 20 patients, under 5 years of age and mainly of the severe phenotype, treated up to 12 months are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 U/ Kg IV every week (recommended dose), 200 U/ Kg IV every week, 200 U/ Kg IV every 2 weeks or 300 U/ Kg IV every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Most patients seroconverted within 3 months of initiation of treatment; although seroconversion in patients under 5 years old with a more severe phenotype occurred mostly within 1 month (mean 26 days versus 45 days in patients 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">By the end of the Phase 3 study (or at time of early study withdrawal), 13/ 45 patients had no detectable antibodies by radioimmunoprecipitation (RIP) assay, including 3 patients that had never seroconverted.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with absent to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in urinary GAG level, whereas patients with high antibody titers showed variable reduction in urinary GAG.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the Phase 3 study and one in the Phase 2 study) showed marginal to low level in vitro inhibition of laronidase enzymatic activity, which did not appear to impact clinical efficacy and/ or urinary GAG reduction.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear to be related to the incidence of IARs, although the onset of IARs typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The rationale for enzyme replacement therapy is to restore a level of enzymatic activity sufficient to hydrolyse the accumulated substrate and to prevent further accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, laronidase is rapidly removed from the circulation and taken up by cells into lysosomes, most likely via mannose-6 phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme was assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, Phase 3 Study of 45 patients, ranging in age from 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients representing the full range of the disease spectrum were enrolled, the majority of the patients were of the intermediate phenotype, with only one patient exhibiting the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were enrolled with a Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) less than 80% of the predicted value and had to be able to stand for 6 minutes and to walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary efficacy endpoints were changes in percent of predicted normal FVC and absolute distance travelled in the six-minute walk test (6MWT).</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients subsequently enrolled in an open label extension study where they all received 100 U/ kg of Aldurazyme every week for an additional 3.5 years (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">Following 26 weeks of therapy, Aldurazyme-treated patients showed improved respiratory function and walking ability as compared to placebo as indicated below.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open label extension study showed improvement and/ or maintenance of these effects up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme/ Aldurazyme group and 182 weeks in the Placebo/ Aldurazyme group as indicated in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in percent predicted FVC is not clinically significant over this timeframe, and absolute lung volumes continued to increase commensurate with changes in height in growing paediatric patients.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with abnormal liver volumes at pre-treatment baseline, 22 (85%) achieved a normal liver size by the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">There was a rapid reduction in the excretion of urinary GAG (µg/ mg creatinine) within the first 4 weeks, which was maintained through the remainder of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">7 To address the heterogeneity in disease manifestation across patients, using a composite endpoint that summed up clinically significant changes across five efficacy variables (percent predicted normal FVC, 6MWT distance, shoulder flexion range of motion, AHI, and visual acuity) the global response was an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%), and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A Phase 2 open-label, 1-year study was conducted that mainly assessed the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme in 20 patients less than 5 years of age at the time of enrolment (16 patients with the severe phenotype and 4 with the intermediate phenotype).</seg>
<seg id="2328">Four patients underwent dosage increases to 200 U/ kg for the last 26 weeks because of elevated urinary GAG levels at Week 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">The younger patients with the severe phenotype (< 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the intermediate phenotype exhibited a normal rate of mental development, whereas the older patients with a severe phenotype made limited or no gains in cognition.</seg>
<seg id="2330">A phase 4 study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects on urinary GAGs, liver volume, and 6MWT, of different Aldurazyme dose regimens.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 U/ Kg IV every week (recommended dose), 200 U/ Kg IV every week, 200 U/ Kg IV every 2 weeks; or 300 U/ KgIV every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The 200 U/ Kg IV every 2 weeks regimen may be an acceptable alternative for patients with difficulty receiving weekly infusions; however, there is no evidence that the long term clinical efficacy of these two dose regimens is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information which may become available every year and this SPC will be updated as necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The pharmacokinetic profile in patients less than 5 years old was similar to that of older and less severely affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, single dose toxicity, repeated dose toxicity and toxicity to reproduction.</seg>

<seg id="2342">People with MPS I disease have either a low level or no level of an enzyme called α -L-iduronidase, which breaks down specific substances (glycosaminoglycans) in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Do not use Aldurazyme If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to any of the ingredients of Aldurazyme or if you have experienced a severe allergic reaction to laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2344">An infusion- associated reaction is any side effect occurring during the infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see 4 “ Possible Side Effects”).</seg>
<seg id="2345">19 Using other medicines Please inform your doctor if you use medicines containing chloroquine or procaine, due to a possible risk of decreasing the action of Aldurazyme.</seg>

<seg id="2347">Instruction for use - dilution and administration The concentrate for solution for infusion has to be diluted before administration and is for intravenous use (see information for health care professionals).</seg>
<seg id="2348">The initial infusion rate of 2 U/ kg/ h may be gradually increased every fifteen minutes, if tolerated, to a maximum of 43 U/ kg/ h.</seg>
<seg id="2349">However, a few patients who had a prior history of severe MPS I related upper airway and pulmonary involvement, experienced severe reactions including bronchospasm, respiratory arrest, and swelling of the face.</seg>
<seg id="2350">20 Very common (occurring in more than 1 in 10 patients) • headache • nausea • abdominal pain • rash • joint disease, joint pain, back pain, pain in arms or legs • flushing • fever • chills • increased heart rate • increased blood pressure • less oxygen in the blood • reaction at the infusion site</seg>

<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with cisplatin (another anticancer medicine) when the cancer is ‘ unresectable’ (cannot be removed by surgery alone) and ‘ malignant’ (has spread, or is likely to spread easily, to other parts of the body), in patients who have not received chemotherapy (medicines for cancer) before. • advanced or metastatic ‘ non-small cell’ lung cancer that is not affecting the ‘ squamous’ cells.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is used in combination with cisplatin in patients who have not been treated before, and on its own in patients who have received another type of chemotherapy in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2356">To reduce side effects, patients should take a corticosteroid and folic acid (a type of vitamin), and receive injections of vitamin B12 during treatment with Alimta.</seg>
<seg id="2357">Treatment should be delayed or discontinued, or the dose reduced, in patients whose blood counts are abnormal or who have certain other side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2358">The active substance in Alimta, pemetrexed, is a cytotoxic medicine (a medicine that kills cells that are dividing, such as cancer cells), which belongs to the group ‘ anti-metabolites’.</seg>
<seg id="2359">As a result, the active form of pemetrexed slows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from dividing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The conversion of pemetrexed into its active form occurs more readily in cancer cells than in normal cells, leading to higher levels of the active form of the medicine and a longer duration of action in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma, Alimta has been studied in one main study in 456 patients who had not received chemotherapy for their disease before.</seg>
<seg id="2362">For the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta were compared with those of docetaxel (another anticancer medicine) in one study involving 571 patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease who had received chemotherapy in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (another anticancer medicine), both in combination with cisplatin, in a study involving 1,725 patients who had not received chemotherapy for lung cancer in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients receiving Alimta and cisplatin survived for an average of 12.1 months, compared with 9.3 months in those receiving cisplatin alone.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had received chemotherapy in the past, the average survival time was 8.3 months with Alimta, compared with 7.9 months with docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">However, in both studies, patients whose cancer was not affecting squamous cells had longer survival times if they received Alimta than if they received the comparator.</seg>
<seg id="2367">The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Alimta to Eli Lilly Nederland B. V. on 20 September 2004.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each vial must be reconstituted with 4.2 ml of sodium chloride 9 mg/ ml (0.9%) solution for injection resulting in 25 mg/ ml of solution.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The appropriate volume of required dose is removed from the vial and further diluted to 100 ml with sodium chloride 9 mg/ ml (0.9%) solution for injection (see section 6.6.).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the first line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA is indicated as monotherapy for the second line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA is 500 mg/ m2 of body surface area (BSA) administered as an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg/ m2 BSA infused over two hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the pemetrexed infusion on the first day of each 21-day cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients treated for non-small cell lung cancer after prior chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA is 500 mg/ m2 BSA administered as an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">To reduce the incidence and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid should be given the day prior to, on the day of, and the day after pemetrexed administration.</seg>
<seg id="2376">At least five doses of folic acid must be taken during the seven days preceding the first dose of pemetrexed, and dosing must continue during the full course of therapy and for 21 days after the last dose of pemetrexed.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients must also receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) in the week preceding the first dose of pemetrexed and once every three cycles thereafter.</seg>
<seg id="2378">Patients receiving pemetrexed should be monitored before each dose with a complete blood count, including a differential white cell count (WCC) and platelet count.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times upper limit of normal.</seg>
<seg id="2380">Dose adjustments at the start of a subsequent cycle should be based on nadir haematologic counts or maximum non-haematologic toxicity from the preceding cycle of therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2381">Upon recovery patients should be retreated using the guidelines in Tables 1, 2 and 3, which are applicable for ALIMTA used as a single agent or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria meet the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) definition of ≥ CTC Grade 2 bleeding</seg>
<seg id="2383">If patients develop non-haematologic toxicities ≥ Grade 3 (excluding neurotoxicity), ALIMTA should be withheld until resolution to less than or equal to the patient’ s pre-therapy value.</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA should be discontinued if a patient experiences any haematologic or non-haematologic Grade 3 or 4 toxicity after 2 doses reductions or immediately if Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity is observed.</seg>
<seg id="2385">In clinical studies, there has been no indication that patients 65 years of age or older are at increased risk of adverse events compared to patients younger than 65 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children below 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical studies, patients with creatinine clearance of ≥ 45 ml/ min required no dose adjustments other than those recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">There are insufficient data on the use of pemetrexed in patients with creatinine clearance below 45 ml/ min; therefore the use of pemetrexed is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However patients with hepatic impairment such as bilirubin > 1.5 times the upper limit of normal and/ or transaminase > 3.0 times the upper limit of normal (hepatic metastases absent) or > 5.0 times the upper limit of normal (hepatic metastases present) have not been specifically studied.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients should be monitored for myelosuppression during therapy and pemetrexed should not be given to patients until absolute neutrophil count (ANC) returns to ≥ 1500 cells/ mm3 and platelet count returns to ≥ 100,000 cells/ mm3.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Dose reductions for subsequent cycles are based on nadir ANC, platelet count and maximum non-haematologic toxicity seen from the previous cycle (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">Less toxicity and reduction in Grade 3/ 4 haematologic and non-haematologic toxicities such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with Grade 3/ 4 neutropenia were reported when pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 was administered.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with pemetrexed must be instructed to take folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance from 45 to 79 ml/ min) should avoid taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as ibuprofen, and aspirin (> 1.3 g daily) for 2 days before, on the day of, and 2 days following pemetrexed administration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients eligible for pemetrexed therapy should avoid taking NSAIDs with long elimination half- lives for at least 5 days prior to, on the day of, and at least 2 days following pemetrexed administration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many of the patients in whom these occurred had underlying risk factors for the development of renal events including dehydration or pre-existing hypertension or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">In patients with clinically significant third space fluid, consideration should be given to draining the effusion prior to pemetrexed administration.</seg>
<seg id="2398">Serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular events have been uncommonly reported during clinical studies with pemetrexed, usually when given in combination with another cytotoxic agent.</seg>
<seg id="2399">As a result, concomitant use of live attenuated vaccines (except yellow fever which is contraindicated) is not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Owing to the possibility of pemetrexed treatment causing irreversible infertility, men are advised to seek counselling on sperm storage before starting treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance > 80 ml/ min), high doses of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen > 1600 mg/ day) and aspirin at higher dosage (> 1.3 g daily) may decrease pemetrexed elimination and, consequently, increase the occurrence of pemetrexed adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore, caution should be made when administering higher doses of NSAIDs or aspirin at higher dosage, concurrently with pemetrexed to patients with normal function (creatinine clearance > 80 ml/ min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">In patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance from 45 to 79 ml/ min), the concomitant administration of pemetrexed with NSAIDs (e. g. ibuprofen) or aspirin at higher dosage should be avoided for 2 days before, on the day of, and 2 days following pemetrexed administration (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the absence of data regarding potential interaction with NSAIDs having longer half-lives as piroxicam or rofecoxib, the concomitant administration with pemetrexed should be avoided for at least 5 days prior to, on the day of, and at least 2 days following pemetrexed administration (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2405">The high intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during diseases and the possibility of interaction between oral anticoagulants and anticancer chemotherapy require increased frequency of INR (International Normalised Ratio) monitoring, if it is decided to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data from the use of pemetrexed in pregnant women but pemetrexed, like other anti-metabolites, is suspected to cause serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly necessary, after a careful consideration of the needs of the mother and the risk for the foetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Owing to the possibility of pemetrexed treatment causing irreversible infertility, men are advised to seek counselling on sperm storage before starting treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether pemetrexed is excreted in human milk and adverse reactions on the suckling child cannot be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The table below provides the frequency and severity of undesirable effects that have been reported in > 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma who were randomised to receive cisplatin and pemetrexed and 163 patients with mesothelioma randomised to receive single agent cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Very common (≥ 1/ 10), Common (≥ 1/ 100 and < 1/ 10), Uncommon (≥ 1/ 1000 and < 1/ 100), Rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 and < 1/ 1000), Very Rare (<  1/ 10,000) and Not known (cannot be estimated from available data-spontaneous reports)</seg>
<seg id="2412">*Refer to National Cancer Institute CTC version 2 for each grade of toxicity except the term “ creatinine clearance decreased” ** which is derived from the term “ renal/ genitourinary other”. *** According to National Cancer Institute CTC (v2.0; NCI 1998), taste disturbance and alopecia should only be reported as Grade 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="2413">For the purpose of this table a cut off of 5% was used for inclusion of all events where the reporter considered a possible relationship to pemetrexed and cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Clinically relevant CTC toxicities that were reported in < 1% (uncommon) of the patients that were randomly assigned to receive cisplatin and pemetrexed include arrhythmia and motor neuropathy.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The table below provides the frequency and severity of undesirable effects that have been reported in > 5% of 265 patients randomly assigned to receive single agent pemetrexed with folic acid and vitamin B12 supplementation and 276 patients randomly assigned to receive single agent docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2416">*Refer to National Cancer Institute CTC version 2 for each grade of toxicity. **According to National Cancer Institute CTC (v2.0; NCI 1998), alopecia should only be reported as Grade 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="2417">For the purpose of this table a cut off of 5% was used for inclusion of all events where the reporter considered a possible relationship to pemetrexed.</seg>
<seg id="2418">Clinically relevant CTC toxicities that were reported in < 1% (uncommon) of the patients that were randomly assigned to pemetrexed include supraventricular arrhythmias.</seg>
<seg id="2419">Clinically relevant Grade 3 and Grade 4 laboratory toxicities were similar between integrated Phase 2 results from three single agent pemetrexed studies (n = 164) and the Phase 3 single agent pemetrexed study described above, with the exception of neutropenia (12.8% versus 5.3%, respectively) and alanine transaminase elevation (15.2% versus 1.9%, respectively).</seg>

<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (pemetrexed) is a multi-targeted anti-cancer antifolate agent that exerts its action by disrupting crucial folate-dependent metabolic processes essential for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies have shown that pemetrexed behaves as a multitargeted antifolate by inhibiting thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT), which are key folate-dependent enzymes for the de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and purine nucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicentre, randomised, single-blind phase 3 study of ALIMTA plus cisplatin versus cisplatin in chemonaive patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma, has shown that patients treated with ALIMTA and cisplatin had a clinically meaningful 2.8-month median survival advantage over patients receiving cisplatin alone.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The primary analysis of this study was performed on the population of all patients randomly assigned to a treatment arm who received study drug (randomised and treated).</seg>
<seg id="2435">A statistically significant improvement of the clinically relevant symptoms (pain and dyspnoea) associated with malignant pleural mesothelioma in the ALIMTA/ cisplatin arm (212 patients) versus the cisplatin arm alone (218 patients) was demonstrated using the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale.</seg>
<seg id="2436">The separation between the treatment arms was achieved by improvement in lung function in the ALIMTA/ cisplatin arm and deterioration of lung function over time in the control arm.</seg>
<seg id="2437">A multicentre, randomised, open label phase 3 study of ALIMTA versus docetaxel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after prior chemotherapy has shown median survival times of 8.3 months for patients treated with ALIMTA (Intent To Treat population n = 283) and 7.9 months for patients treated with docetaxel (ITT n = 288).</seg>
<seg id="2438">An analysis of the impact of NSCLC histology on the treatment effect on overall survival was in favour of ALIMTA versus docetaxel for other than predominantly squamous histologies (n=399, 9.3 versus 8.0 months, adjusted HR = 0.78; 95% CI =0 .61-1.00, p =0.047) and was in favour of docetaxel for squamous cell carcinoma histology (n=172, 6.2 versus 7.4 months, adjusted HR = 1.56; 95% CI =1.08-2.26, p =0.018).</seg>
<seg id="2439">Limited clinical data from a separate randomized, Phase 3, controlled trial, suggest that efficacy data (overall survival, progression free survival) for pemetrexed are similar between patients previously pre treated with docetaxel (n=41) and patients who did not receive previous docetaxel treatment (n=540).</seg>
<seg id="2440">The efficacy analyses using PQ population are consistent with the analyses for the ITT population and support the non-inferiority of AC versus GC.</seg>
<seg id="2441">Progression free survival (PFS) and overall response rate were similar between treatment arms: median PFS was 4.8 months for ALIMTA plus cisplatin versus 5.1 months for gemcitabine plus cisplatin (adjusted hazard ratio 1.04; 95% CI 0.94-1.15), and overall response rate was 30.6% (95% CI 27.3- 33.9) for ALIMTA plus cisplatin versus 28.2% (95% CI 25.0-31.4) for gemcitabine plus cisplatin.</seg>

<seg id="2504">If patients taking Alli have been unable to lose weight after 12 weeks, they should speak to their doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2505">When these enzymes are blocked, they cannot digest some fats in the diet, and this allows about a quarter of the fat eaten in the meal to pass through the gut undigested.</seg>
<seg id="2506">The third study compared Alli with placebo in 391 overweight patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg/ m2.</seg>
<seg id="2507">In the two studies of patients with a BMI of 28 kg/ m2 or more, patients taking Alli 60 mg had lost an average of 4.8 kg after a year, compared with 2.3 kg in those taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">The study of Alli in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg/ m2 failed to show a degree of weight loss that would be relevant for patients.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects with Alli (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) are oily spotting, flatus (gas) with discharge, faecal urgency (urgent need to open the bowels), fatty oily stool, oily evacuation (faeces), flatulence (gas) and soft stools.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It must not be used in people who are being treated with ciclosporin (used to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients) or with medicines used to prevent blood clots such as warfarin.</seg>

<seg id="2514">alli should not be used in children and adolescents below 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2515">2 However, as orlistat is minimally absorbed, no dosage adjustment is necessary in elderly and in individuals with hepatic and/ or renal impairment.</seg>

<seg id="2517">The possibility of experiencing gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) may increase when orlistat is taken with an individual meal or a diet high in fat.</seg>
<seg id="2518">As weight loss may be accompanied by improved metabolic control in diabetes, patients who are taking a medicinal product for diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting treatment with alli, in case it is necessary to adjust the dose of the antidiabetic medicinal product.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who are taking a medicinal product for hypertension or hypercholesterolaemia should consult a doctor or pharmacist when taking alli, in case it is necessary to adjust the dose of these medicinal products.</seg>
<seg id="2520">The use of an additional contraceptive method is recommended to prevent possible failure of oral contraception that could occur in case of severe diarrhoea (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">A decrease in ciclosporin plasma levels has been observed in a drug-drug interaction study and also reported in several cases, when orlistat was administered concomitantly.</seg>
<seg id="2522">When warfarin or other oral anticoagulants are given in combination with orlistat, international normalised ratio (INR) values could be affected (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">The vast majority of subjects receiving up to 4 full years of treatment with orlistat in clinical studies had vitamin A, D, E and K and beta-carotene levels that stayed within normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be advised to use a multivitamin supplement at bedtime to help ensure adequate vitamin intake (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">A decrease in plasma levels of amiodarone, when given as a single dose, has been observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat concomitantly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">Adverse reactions to orlistat are largely gastrointestinal in nature and related to the pharmacologic effect of the medicinal product on preventing the absorption of ingested fat.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal adverse reactions identified from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg of 18 months to 2 years duration were generally mild and transient.</seg>
<seg id="2529">Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/ 10), common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10), uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100), rare (≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000) and very rare (< 1/ 10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).</seg>
<seg id="2530">4 The frequencies of adverse reactions identified during post-marketing use of orlistat are not known as these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that treatment with orlistat can lead to anxiety in anticipation of or secondary to gastrointestinal adverse reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times daily for 15 days have been studied in normal weight and obese subjects without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The majority of orlistat overdose cases received during post-marketing reported either no adverse reactions or adverse reactions that are similar to those reported with recommended doses of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on human and animal studies, any systemic effects attributable to the lipase-inhibiting properties of orlistat should be rapidly reversible.</seg>
<seg id="2535">It exerts its therapeutic activity in the lumen of the stomach and small intestine by forming a covalent bond with the active serine site of the gastric and pancreatic lipases.</seg>
<seg id="2536">From clinical studies, it has been estimated that orlistat 60 mg taken three times daily blocks the absorption of approximately 25% of dietary fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg/ m2 support the efficacy of orlistat 60 mg taken three times daily in conjunction with a hypocaloric, lower-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, change in body weight from baseline (time of randomisation), was assessed for body weight over time (Table 1) and the percentage of subjects who lost ≥ 5% or ≥ 10% of body weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although weight loss was assessed during 12 months of treatment in both studies, most weight loss occurred within the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The mean relative change in total cholesterol was -2.4% for orlistat 60 mg (baseline 5.20 mmol/ l) and +2.8% for placebo (baseline 5.26 mmol/ l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The mean relative change in LDL cholesterol was -3.5% for orlistat 60 mg (baseline 3.30 mmol/ l) and +3.8% for</seg>
<seg id="2542">For waist circumference, the mean change was -4.5 cm for orlistat 60 mg (baseline 103.7 cm) and -3.6 cm for placebo (baseline 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of intact orlistat were non-measurable (< 5 ng/ ml) 8 hours following oral administration of orlistat 360 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2544">In general, at therapeutic doses, detection of intact orlistat in plasma was sporadic and concentrations were extremely low (< 10 ng/ ml or 0.02 µmol), with no evidence of accumulation, which is consistent with minimal absorption.</seg>
<seg id="2545">Based on a study in obese patients, of the minimal fraction of the dose that was absorbed systemically, two major metabolites, M1 (4-member lactone ring hydrolysed) and M3 (M1 with N-formyl leucine moiety cleaved), accounted for approximately 42% of the total plasma concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2560">What alli contains What alli looks like and contents of the pack Marketing authorisation holder and manufacturer Further helpful information</seg>
<seg id="2561">alli is used for weight loss in adults aged 18 and over who are overweight, and have a body mass index (BMI) of 28 or above. alli should be used along with a reduced calorie, lower-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2562">23 BMI is a way to find out if you have a healthy weight, or are overweight, for your height.</seg>
<seg id="2563">These conditions may not cause you to feel unwell so you should see your doctor for a general health check.</seg>
<seg id="2564">For every 2 kg (4 lb) you lose from dieting alone, alli can help you lose 1 kg (2 lb) more.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.</seg>
<seg id="2566">Do not take alli with these medicines • Ciclosporin: ciclosporin is used after organ transplants, for severe rheumatoid arthritis and some severe skin conditions. • Warfarin or other medicines used to thin the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2567">The oral contraceptive pill and alli • The oral contraceptive pill may be less effective if you get severe diarrhoea.</seg>
<seg id="2568">Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking alli if you are taking • amiodarone, used for heart rhythm problems. • acarbose, used for diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2569">Talk to your doctor or pharmacist when taking alli • If you are taking a medicine for high blood pressure as it may be necessary to adjust your dose. • If you are taking a medicine for high cholesterol as it may be necessary to adjust your dose.</seg>
<seg id="2570">For information on how to set your calorie and fat targets, see Further helpful information in the blue pages in Chapter 6.</seg>
<seg id="2571">If you miss a meal, or your meal contains no fat, do not take a capsule. alli does not work unless there's some fat in the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2572">Taking the capsule with a meal containing too much fat may increase your chance of getting diet-related treatment effects (see Chapter 4).</seg>
<seg id="2573">Before you start taking the capsules, begin your reduced calorie, lower-fat diet and give your body a few days to adjust to your new eating habits.</seg>
<seg id="2574">Food diaries are effective, because they make you aware of what you are eating, how much you eat, and give you the basis to make changes.</seg>
<seg id="2575">To help you reach your weight-loss goal you need to set two daily targets, one for calories and one for fat.</seg>
<seg id="2576">• Eat lower-fat meals to reduce the chance of diet-related treatment effects (see Chapter 4). • Try to be more physically active before you start taking the capsules.</seg>
<seg id="2577">Remember to check with your doctor first if you have not exercised before. • Continue to be active while taking alli and after you stop taking it.</seg>
<seg id="2578">• alli should not be taken for more than six months. • If you do not lose weight after taking alli for 12 weeks, see your doctor or pharmacist for advice.</seg>
<seg id="2579">You may need to stop taking alli. • Successful weight loss is not just about eating differently for a short period of time before reverting to your old habits.</seg>
<seg id="2580">• If it is less than an hour since your last main meal, take the missed capsule. • If it is more than an hour since your last main meal, do not take the missed capsule.</seg>
<seg id="2581">Most of the common side effects related to alli (for example, wind with or without oily spotting, sudden or more frequent bowel motions and soft stools) are caused by the way it works (see Chapter 1).</seg>
<seg id="2582">Severe allergic reactions • Signs of a severe allergic reaction include: severe breathing difficulties, sweating, rash, itching, swollen face, rapid heart beat, collapse.</seg>
<seg id="2583">Very common side effects These may affect more than 1 in 10 people taking alli • Wind (flatulence), with or without oily spotting • Sudden bowel motions • Fatty or oily stools • Soft stools Tell your doctor or pharmacist if any of these side effects gets severe or troublesome.</seg>
<seg id="2584">Common side effects These may affect up to 1 in 10 people taking alli • Stomach (abdominal) pain • Incontinence (stools) • Runny/liquid stools • More frequent bowel motions • Anxiety Tell your doctor or pharmacist if any these side effects gets severe or troublesome.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Effects seen in blood tests It is not known how frequently these effects occur • Increases in the levels of some liver enzymes • Effects on blood clotting in people taking warfarin or other blood-thinning (anti-coagulant) medicines Tell your doctor that you are taking alli when you have a blood test.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If any of the side effects become serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, tell your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2587">The most common side effects are caused by the way the capsules work and result from some of the fat being passed out of your body.</seg>
<seg id="2588">Such effects typically occur within the first few weeks of using the capsules, before you may have learnt to limit the amount of fat in your diet.</seg>
<seg id="2589">You can learn to minimise the impact of diet-related treatment effects by following these guidelines: • Start your lower-fat diet a few days, or even a week, before you begin taking the capsules. • Find out more about how much fat your favourite foods typically contain, and the size of your portions.</seg>
<seg id="2590">By familiarising yourself with portions you will be less likely to accidentally exceed your fat target. • Distribute your fat allowance evenly across your meals for the day.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Do not “save up” fat and calorie allowances and then splurge on a high-fat meal or dessert, as you may have done on other weight loss programmes. • Most users who experience these effects find that they can manage and control them by adjusting their diet.</seg>
<seg id="2592">• Keep out of the reach and sight of children. • Do not use alli after the expiry date which is stated on the carton. • Do not store above 25°C. • Keep the container tightly closed to protect from moisture. • The bottle contains two sealed canisters containing silica gel to keep the capsules dry.</seg>
<seg id="2593">Do not swallow them. • You can also keep your daily dose of alli in the blue carry case (Shuttle) included in this pack.</seg>

<seg id="2595">Being overweight will affect your health and increase your risk of developing serious health problems such as: • High blood pressure • Diabetes • Heart disease • Stroke • Certain forms of cancer • Osteoarthritis Talk to your doctor about your risk of developing these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2596">Losing weight and maintaining weight loss, for example by improving your diet and increasing your physical activity, can help reduce the risk of serious health problems and help improve your health.</seg>
<seg id="2597">You should choose meals which contain a range of different nutrients and learn to eat healthily for the long term.</seg>
<seg id="2598">Energy may also be measured in kilojoules, which you may also see on food labels. • The calorie target is the maximum number of calories you’ll eat each day.</seg>
<seg id="2599">See the chart further on in this section. • Your fat gram target is the maximum number of grams of fat you’ll eat in each meal.</seg>
<seg id="2600">The fat gram target chart follows the information below on setting your calorie target. • Controlling your fat target is essential because of the way the capsules work.</seg>
<seg id="2601">Taking alli means your body will pass more fat through, and therefore may struggle to cope with eating as much fat as before.</seg>
<seg id="2602">So by meeting your fat target, you’ll maximise weight loss results while minimising the risk of diet-related treatment effects. • You should aim to lose weight gradually and steadily.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Your calorie target alone should allow you to lose weight at a gradual, steady pace of about 0.5 kg (1 lb) per week, without feeling frustrated or deprived.</seg>
<seg id="2604">The more active you are, the higher your calorie target. • Low Activity means you do little or no walking, climbing stairs, gardening, or other physical activity on a daily basis. • Moderate Activity means you burn around 150 calories per day in physical activity, for example, walking three kilometres (2 miles), gardening for 30 to 45 minutes, or running two kilometres (1.25 miles) in 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2605">• Stick to realistic calorie and fat targets as this is a good way of maintaining your weight loss achievements in the long-term. • Write down what you eat in a food diary, including the calorie and fat content. • Try to be more physically active before you start taking the capsules.</seg>
<seg id="2606">The alli weight loss programme combines the capsules with an eating plan and a wide range of resources to help you understand how to eat a reduced calorie, lower-fat diet and guidelines for becoming more active.</seg>
<seg id="2607">The alli website (please refer to your country specific website included in the list of local representatives above) provides you with a range of interactive tools, lower-fat recipes, physical activity tips and other useful information to help you lead a healthy life and to support you in meeting your weight loss goals, together with details of a weight loss programme which is individually tailored for you.</seg>
<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used for chemotherapy that is a strong trigger of nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin) and for chemotherapy that is a moderate trigger (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">Aloxi may be made more effective by the addition of a corticosteroid (a type of medicine that can be used as an anti-emetic).</seg>
<seg id="2610">It is not recommended for use in patients below 18 years of age because there is not enough information on its effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that it stops a chemical in the body called 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT, also known as serotonin) from attaching to its receptors in the gut.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi has been studied in three main studies involving 1,842 adults receiving chemotherapy that was a strong or a moderate trigger of nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">With chemotherapy that was a strong trigger of nausea and vomiting, 59% of the patients receiving Aloxi did not vomit in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 out of 223), compared with 57% of the patients receiving with ondansetron (126 out of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">With chemotherapy that was a moderate trigger of nausea and vomiting, 81% of the patients receiving Aloxi did not vomit in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 out of 189) compared with 69% of those receiving ondansetron (127 out of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">When it was compared with dolasetron, these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 patients out of 189) and 53% for dolasetron (101 patients out of 191).</seg>
<seg id="2616">The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Aloxi to Helsinn Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. on 22 March 2005.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicated for: the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting associated with highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy and the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi in the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by highly emetogenic chemotherapy may be enhanced by the addition of a corticosteroid administered prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">As palonosetron may increase large bowel transit time, patients with a history of constipation or signs of subacute intestinal obstruction should be monitored following administration.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as for other 5-HT3 antagonists, caution should be exercised in the concomitant use of palonosetron with medicinal products that increase the QT interval or in patients who have or are likely to develop prolongation of the QT interval.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Aloxi should not be used to prevent or treat nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy if not associated with another chemotherapy administration.</seg>
<seg id="2622">Chemotherapeutic agents: in preclinical studies, palonosetron did not inhibit the antitumour activity of the five chemotherapeutic agents tested (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, doxorubicin and mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">Metoclopramide: in a clinical study, no significant pharmacokinetic interaction was shown between a single intravenous dose of palonosetron and steady state concentration of oral metoclopramide, which is a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">CYP2D6 inducers and inhibitors: in a population pharmacokinetic analysis, it has been shown that there was no significant effect on palonosetron clearance when co-administered with CYP2D6 inducers (dexamethasone and rifampicin) and inhibitors (including amiodarone, celecoxib, chlorpromazine, cimetidine, doxorubicin, fluoxetine, haloperidol, paroxetine, quinidine, ranitidine, ritonavir, sertraline or terbinafine).</seg>
<seg id="2625">3 There is no experience of palonosetron in human pregnancy so palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered essential by the physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical studies at a dose of 250 micrograms (total 633 patients) the most frequently observed adverse reactions, at least possibly related to Aloxi, were headache (9%) and constipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (< 1/ 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and injection site reactions (burning, induration, discomfort and pain) were reported from post-marketing experience.</seg>
<seg id="2628">The highest dose group showed a similar incidence of adverse events compared to the other dose groups and no dose response effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Dialysis studies have not been performed, however, due to the large volume of distribution, dialysis is unlikely to be an effective treatment for Aloxi overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised, double-blind studies with a total of 1,132 patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy that included cisplatin ≤ 50 mg/ m2, carboplatin, cyclophosphamide ≤ 1,500 mg/ m2 and doxorubicin > 25 mg/ m2, palonosetron 250 micrograms and 750 micrograms were compared with ondansetron 32 mg (half-life 4 hours) or dolasetron 100 mg (half-life 7.3 hours) administered intravenously on Day 1, without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised, double-blind study with a total of 667 patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy that included cisplatin ≥ 60 mg/ m2, cyclophosphamide > 1,500 mg/ m2 and dacarbazine, palonosetron 250 micrograms and 750 micrograms were compared with ondansetron 32 mg administered intravenously on Day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results for the studies on moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and for the study on highly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarised in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">7 The effect of palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate, and ECG parameters including QTc were comparable to ondansetron and dolasetron in CINV clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2634">In non-clinical studies palonosetron possesses the ability to block ion channels involved in ventricular de- and re-polarisation and to prolong action potential duration.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The objective was to evaluate the ECG effects of IV administered palonosetron at single doses of 0.25, 0.75 or 2.25 mg in 221 healthy subjects.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Absorption Following intravenous administration, an initial decline in plasma concentrations is followed by slow elimination from the body with a mean terminal elimination half-life of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Mean maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0-∞) are generally dose-proportional over the dose range of 0.3– 90 μ g/ kg in healthy subjects and in cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">Following intravenous administration of palonosetron 0.25 mg once every other day for 3 doses in 11 testicular cancer patients, the mean (± SD) increase in plasma concentration from Day 1 to Day 5 was 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations indicate that the overall exposure (AUC0-∞) of 0.25 mg intravenous palonosetron administered once daily for 3 consecutive days was similar to a single intravenous dose of 0.75 mg, although Cmax of the 0.75 mg single dose was higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">Metabolism Palonosetron is eliminated by dual route, about 40% eliminated through the kidney and with approximately 50% metabolised to form two primary metabolites, which have less than 1% of the 5HT3 receptor antagonist activity of palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In vitro metabolism studies have shown that CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent, CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 isoenzymes are involved in the metabolism of palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After a single intravenous dose of 10 micrograms/ kg [14C]-palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose was recovered within 144 hours in the urine with palonosetron representing approximately 40% of the administered dose, as unchanged active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a single intravenous bolus administration in healthy subjects the total body clearance of palonosetron was 173 ± 73 ml/ min and renal clearance was 53 ± 29 ml/ min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">While the terminal elimination half-life and mean systemic exposure of palonosetron is increased in the subjects with severe hepatic impairment, this does not warrant dose reduction.</seg>
<seg id="2645">Effects in non-clinical studies were observed only at exposures considered sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">Nonclinical studies indicate that palonosetron, only at very high concentrations, may block ion channels involved in ventricular de- and re-polarisation and prolong action potential duration.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of palonosetron (each dose causing at least 30 times the human therapeutic exposure) applied daily for two years caused an increased rate of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal medulla) and skin tumours in rats but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, but because of the high doses employed and since Aloxi is intended for single application in humans, these findings are not considered relevant for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2649">The holder of this marketing authorisation must inform the European Commission about the marketing plans for the medicinal product authorised by this decision.</seg>

<seg id="2660">On 28 June 2006 the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a negative opinion, recommending the refusal of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Alpheon 6 million IU/ ml solution for injection intended for the treatment of hepatitis C.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon was intended to be similar to a biological medicine already authorised in the EU which contains the same active substance (also known as the ‘ reference medicine’), Roferon-A.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon was expected to be used to treat adult patients who have chronic (long-term) hepatitis C (a disease of the liver due to an infection by a virus).</seg>
<seg id="2663">The patients must have signs of liver damage: their liver tissues show some damage when observed with a microscope, and they have higher than normal levels of a liver enzyme (ALT) in their blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">The interferon in Alpheon, interferon alfa-2a, is made by a method known as ‘ recombinant DNA technology’: it is made by a yeast that has received a gene (DNA) that makes it able to produce it.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The company that makes Alpheon presented information showing that Alpheon had been compared to Roferon-A (structure of the active substance, composition and purity of the medicine, the way it works, safety and effectiveness in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">The study in patients with hepatitis C compared the efficacy of Alpheon with that of the reference medicine in 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded (no sign of virus in their blood) after 12 out of the 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after stopping treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2668">(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: mail@emea. eu. int http: / /www. emea. eu. int ©EMEA 2006 Reproduction and/ or distribution of this document is authorised for non commercial purposes only provided the EMEA is acknowledged What were the major concerns which led the CHMP to recommend the refusal of the marketing authorisation?</seg>
<seg id="2669">They also had concerns that there was not enough data on the stability of the active substance and of the medicine that was going to be marketed.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C responding to treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">However, some differences were seen between the two medicines: more patients experienced a return of the disease after treatment with Alpheon was stopped than with the reference medicine, and there were more side effects with Alpheon.</seg>
<seg id="2672">In addition, the test used in the study to investigate the potential for the medicine to trigger an immunological response (when the body makes special proteins, called antibodies, against the medicine) had not been sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat impetigo (a skin infection causing crusting scabs), and small infected lacerations (cuts), abrasions (grazes) and wounds that have been sutured (stitched).</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections known or thought likely to be due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), as it may not work against this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years of age, the area to be treated should not be more than 2% of the body’ s surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If there is no response to treatment after two to three days, doctors should re-evaluate the patient and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacteria’ s ribosomes (the parts of the cells where proteins are produced), inhibiting the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">In all five studies, the main measure of effectiveness was the proportion of patients whose infections had cleared up after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">In patients with impetigo, Altargo was more effective than placebo, with 119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients using Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 using placebo responding to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">For the treatment of infected skin wounds, Altargo and cefalexin had similar response rates: when the results of both skin wound studies were taken together, around 90% of both groups of patients responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">However, these two studies found that Altargo was not sufficiently effective in the treatment of abscesses (cavities containing pus) or of infections known or likely to be caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100) is irritation at the site of application.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Altargo’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the short term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • impetigo, • infected small lacerations, abrasions or sutured wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Altargo to Glaxo Group Ltd on 24 May 2007.</seg>
<seg id="2685">2 Patients not showing a clinical response within two to three days should be re-evaluated and alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of a sensitisation or severe local irritation from the use of retapamulin ointment, treatment should be discontinued, the ointment carefully wiped off, and appropriate alternative therapy for the infection instituted.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used to treat infections known or thought likely to be due to MRSA (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical studies of secondarily infected open wounds, the efficacy of retapamulin was inadequate in patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if there is no improvement or a worsening in the infected area after 2-3 days of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of concurrent application of retapamulin and other topical products to the same area of skin has not been studied, and is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Based on the low plasma concentration achieved in humans after topical application to abraded skin or infected superficial wounds, a clinically relevant inhibition is not expected in vivo (see section 5.2)</seg>
<seg id="2692">Co-administration of oral ketoconazole 200mg twice daily increased mean retapamulin AUC(0-24) and Cmax by 81% after topical application of retapamulin 1% ointment on the abraded skin of healthy adult males.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to low systemic exposure following topical application in patients, dosage adjustments are considered to be unnecessary when topical retapamulin is applied during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity after oral administration and are insufficient with respect to effects on parturition and fetal/ postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin ointment should only be used in pregnancy when topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retapamulin is considered to be preferable to administration of a systemic antibacterial agent.</seg>
<seg id="2696">A decision on whether to continue/ discontinue breast-feeding or to continue/ discontinue therapy with Altargo should be made taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of Altargo therapy to the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies in which 2150 patients with superficial skin infections applied Altargo, the most commonly reported adverse reaction was application site irritation, which affected approximately 1% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of the compound pleuromutilin, which is isolated through fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">Retapamulin selectively inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by interacting at a unique site on the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome that is distinct from the binding sites of other non- pleuromutilin antibacterial agents that interact with the ribosome.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding site involves ribosomal protein L3 and is in the region of the ribosomal P site and peptidyl transferase centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By virtue of binding to this site, pleuromutilins inhibit peptidyl transfer, partially block P-site interactions, and prevent normal formation of active 50S ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">As necessary, expert advice should be sought when the local prevalence of resistance is such that the utility of the agent in at least some types of infection is questionable.</seg>
<seg id="2703">No differences were observed in the in vitro activity of retapamulin versus S. aureus whether the isolates were susceptible or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In the case of treatment failure associated with S. aureus, the presence of strains possessing additional virulence factors (such as Panton-Valentine Leukocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">In a study of healthy adult subjects, 1% retapamulin ointment was applied daily to intact and to abraded skin under occlusion for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Single plasma samples were obtained from 516 adult and paediatric patients who received topical treatment with retapamulin 1% ointment twice daily for 5 days for the treatment of secondarily infected traumatic lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Sampling occurred pre-dose for adult subjects on days 3 or 4, and between 0-12 hours after the last application for paediatric subjects on days 3 or 4.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic exposure in humans following topical application of 1% ointment on 200 cm2 of abraded skin (Cmax= 22 ng/ ml; AUC(0-24) = 238 ng. h/ ml) was 660-fold lower than the retapamulin IC50 for Pgp inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retapamulin in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4 with minor contributions from CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In 14-day (50, 150 or 450 mg/ kg) oral toxicity studies in rats there was evidence of adaptive hepatic and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">There was no evidence of genotoxicity when evaluated in vitro for gene mutation and/ or chromosomal effects in the mouse lymphoma cell assay, in cultured human peripheral blood lymphocytes, or when evaluated in vivo for chromosomal effects in a rat micronucleus test.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was no evidence of impaired fertility in male or female rats at oral doses of 50, 150, or 450 mg/ kg/ day, resulting in exposure margins of up to 5-times the highest human estimated exposure (topical application to 200 cm2 abraded skin:</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study in rats, developmental toxicity (decreased fetal body weight and delayed skeletal ossification) and maternal toxicity were observed at oral doses of ≥ 150 mg/ kg/ day (corresponding to ≥ 3 times the human estimated exposure (see above).</seg>
<seg id="2714">The MAH must ensure that the system of pharmacovigilance, as described in version 6.2 presented in Module 1.8.1. of the Marketing Authorisation Application, is in place and functioning before the product is placed on the market and for as long as the marketed product remains in use.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases that affect the liver) in children between one and 15 years of age who are not already immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as a two-dose schedule and protection against hepatitis B may not be obtained until after the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">Because of this, Ambirix should only be used when there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during the vaccination course, and when it is certain that the two-dose vaccination course can be completed.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Where a booster dose of hepatitis A or B is desired, Ambirix, or a separate hepatitis A or B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by ‘ teaching’ the immune system (the body’ s natural defences) how to defend itself against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">When a child is given the vaccine, the immune system recognises the viruses and surface antigens as ‘ foreign’ and makes antibodies against them.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same ingredients as Twinrix Adult, which has been authorised since 1996, and as Twinrix Paediatric, which has been authorised since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but Twinrix Adult and Twinrix Paediatric are given as a three-dose schedule.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix Adult contain identical ingredients, some of the data used to support the use of Twinrix Adult were used to support the use of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main measure of effectiveness was the proportion of vaccinated children who developed protective levels of antibodies one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">An additional study in 208 children compared the vaccine’ s effectiveness when a six-month or a 12- month interval was used between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix led to the development of protective levels of antibodies against hepatitis A and B in between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children at one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the levels of protection with Ambirix were similar with a six- and a 12-month gap between injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects with Ambirix (seen in more than 1 in 10 doses of the vaccine) are headache, loss of appetite, pain at the site of injection, redness, fatigue (tiredness) and irritability or fussiness.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to any of the active substances, to any of the other ingredients or to neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the EU for Ambirix to GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals s. a. on 30 August 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standard primary course of vaccination with Ambirix consists of two doses, the first administered at the elected date and the second between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">In situations where a booster dose of hepatitis A and/ or hepatitis B is desired, a monovalent or combined vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibody titres observed following a primary vaccination course with Ambirix are in the range of what is seen following vaccination with the monovalent hepatitis A and B vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully established whether immunocompetent individuals who have responded to hepatitis A vaccination will require booster doses as protection in the absence of detectable antibodies may be ensured by immunological memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If rapid protection against hepatitis B is required, the standard three dose regimen of the combined vaccine containing 360 ELISA Units of formalin inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In haemodialysis patients and persons with an impaired immune system, adequate anti-HAV and anti-HBs antibody titers may not be obtained after the primary immunisation course.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since intradermal injection or intramuscular administration into the gluteal muscle could lead to a suboptimal response to the vaccine, these routes should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However, exceptionally Ambirix can be administered subcutaneously to subjects with thrombocytopenia or bleeding disorders since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular administration to these subjects.</seg>
<seg id="2748">When Ambirix was administered concomitantly with, but as a separate injection to a combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (DTPa-IPV/ Hib) or with a combined Measles-Mumps-Rubella vaccine in the second year of life, immune responses to all antigens were satisfactory (see section 5.1)</seg>
<seg id="2749">It may be expected that in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment or patients with immunodeficiency, an adequate response may not be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults, the incidence of pain, redness, swelling, fatigue, gastro-enteritis, headache and fever was comparable to the incidence observed with the former thiomersal and preservative containing vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">Clinical trials involved the administration of 2029 doses of Ambirix to 1027 subjects from 1 year up to and including 15 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study, in 300 subjects aged from 12 years up to and including 15 years, the reactogenicity profile of Ambirix was compared to that of the three-dose combined vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">5 combined vaccine, the only exceptions being a higher incidence of pain and fatigue on a per dose basis after Ambirix, but not on a per subject basis.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was reported following 50.7% of doses in the Ambirix group, as compared to 39.1% of doses with the three dose combined vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">However, over the complete vaccination course, 66.4% of subjects who received Ambirix reported pain, as compared to 63.8% of subjects who received the three dose combined vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the incidence of fatigue was similar based on a per subject analysis (i. e. over the total vaccination course, 39.6% versus 36.2% of subjects for Ambirix and the three dose vaccine respectively).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The incidence of pain and fatigue graded as severe was low and similar to that observed with the three dose combined vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative trial in subjects aged 1-11 years, the incidences of local and general solicited symptoms in the Ambirix group were similar to those seen with the three-dose combined vaccine containing 360 ELISA Units of formalin inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">The exception was a higher incidence of pain after Ambirix in 6-11 year olds on a per dose basis, but not on a per subject basis.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The percentages of vaccinees reporting any solicited symptom graded as severe during a two-dose regimen of Ambirix or a three dose regimen with the combined vaccine containing 360 ELISA Units of formalin inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen, were not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical studies involving subjects from 1 year up to and including 15 years old, seropositivity rates for anti-HAV antibodies were 99.1% one month after the first dose and 100% after the second dose given at month 6 (i. e month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">Seropositivity rates for anti-HBs antibodies were 74.2% one month after the first dose and 100% after the second dose given at month 6 (i. e. month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">In a comparative clinical trial conducted among subjects aged from 12 years up to and including 15 years of age, 142 received two doses of Ambirix and 147 received the standard three-dose combined vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2764">For the 289 subjects evaluable for immunogenicity, seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) against hepatitis B were significantly higher at months 2 and 6 with the three-dose vaccine than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">Immune responses obtained one month after the full vaccination course (i. e at month 7) in a comparative clinical trial in children aged 1-11 years are presented in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, subjects received either a two dose schedule of Ambirix or a three dose regimen of the combined vaccine containing 360 ELISA Units of formalin inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In subjects aged 12-15 years at the time of primary vaccination, anti-HAV and anti-HBs antibodies have been shown to persist for at least 24 months following the initiation of a 0, 6 month schedule of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2768">In this study, the immune response to both antigen components was comparable to that seen after a 3-dose regimen of the combined vaccine containing 360 ELISA Units of formalin inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study involving subjects from 12 years up to and including 15 years of age, the persistence of anti-HAV and anti-HBs antibodies at month 24 was shown to be similar following a 0, 6 month or a 0, 12 month schedule.</seg>
<seg id="2770">When the first dose of Ambirix was administered concomitantly with a booster dose of a combined diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (DTPa-IPV/ Hib) or with the first dose of a combined Measles-Mumps-Rubella vaccine in the second year of life, immune responses to all antigens were satisfactory.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed that the current formulation elicited similar seroprotection and seroconversion rates as compared to the former formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine should be visually inspected both before and after resuspension for any foreign particulate matter and/ or change in physical appearance.</seg>

<seg id="2777">The hepatitis A virus is usually caught from food or drink that contains the virus, but is sometimes spread by other means, such as swimming in water contaminated by sewage.</seg>
<seg id="2778">They may be extremely tired, and have dark urine, pale faces, yellowish skin and/ or eyes (jaundice), and other symptoms possibly requiring hospitalisation.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix cannot completely prevent infections with hepatitis A or B viruses, even after you have/ your child has received both doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">20 Also, if you have/ your child has already been infected with hepatitis A or B virus (although not yet feeling unwell) before having both doses of Ambirix, the vaccine may not be able to prevent you/ your child becoming ill.</seg>
<seg id="2781">It cannot protect you/ your child against other infections that can affect the liver that can cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis A or B infections.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• if you have/ your child has previously had any allergic reaction to Ambirix, or any ingredient contained in this vaccine including neomycin (antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">Signs of an allergic reaction may include itchy skin rash, shortness of breath and swelling of the face or tongue. • if you have/ your child has previously had an allergic reaction to any vaccine against hepatitis A or hepatitis B diseases. • if you have/ your child has a severe infection with a high temperature.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• if you think that you need to be protected rapidly against hepatitis B infection, that is, within six months and before the second dose will be due.</seg>
<seg id="2785">If you are/ your child is likely to be at risk of hepatitis B infection between the timing of the first and second injections, your doctor will probably recommend that you do/ your child does not receive Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, you/ your child will probably need to have three injections of a combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine that has a lower content in each dose of the active substances (360 ELISA Units of formalin inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second of the three doses of this lower dose vaccine is usually given at one month after the first dose, and it is more likely to protect you/ your child against hepatitis B before the course is completed.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes Ambirix is given as an injection just under the skin instead of into muscle in people who have severe bleeding problems. • if you have/ your child has a poor immune system due to illness or treatment or if you are/ your child is receiving haemodialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can still be given but these people may not have a good response to the vaccine and it may be necessary to do a blood test to see how well they have responded.</seg>
<seg id="2790">Tell your doctor if you are taking any medicines (including any that you may have obtained without a prescription) or if you have recently had or expect to shortly have any other vaccinations or injections of immunoglobulins (antibodies).</seg>
<seg id="2791">People who are taking medicines that decrease the body’ s immunity to infections can still have Ambirix if this is thought to be necessary but may not have a good immune response to the vaccine and so may not be protected against one or both of hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine is to be given at the same time as Ambirix, separate sites and preferably different limbs should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix has to be given at the same time as or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that you will still make a good immune response to the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Ambirix is not usually given to women who are pregnant or breast-feeding unless it is urgent for them to be vaccinated against both hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information about some of the ingredients of Ambirix Please tell your doctor if you have had an allergic reaction to neomycin (antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2796">If you miss/ your child misses the visit scheduled for the second injection, talk to your doctor and arrange another visit as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2797">♦ Very common (more than 1 in 10 doses of vaccine): • Pain or discomfort at the injection site or redness • Tiredness • Irritability • Headache</seg>
<seg id="2798">♦ Common (up to 1 in 10 doses of vaccine): • Swelling at the injection site • Fever (more than 38°C) • Drowsiness • Stomach and digestive complaints</seg>
<seg id="2799">Additional side effects that have been reported very rarely (less than 1 in 10,000 doses of vaccine) in the days or weeks after vaccination with very similar combined or individual hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccines, include:</seg>
<seg id="2800">These may be local or widespread rashes that may be itchy or blistering, swelling of the eyes and face, difficulty in breathing or swallowing, a sudden drop in blood pressure and loss of consciousness.</seg>
<seg id="2801">Flu-like symptoms, including chills, and muscle and joint pains Fits, dizziness, pins and needles, multiple sclerosis, disease of the nerves of the eye, loss of sensation in, or of the ability to move some parts of the body, severe headache with stiff neck, disruption of the normal brain functions</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in a pack size of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based upon the data that have become available since the granting of the initial Marketing Authorisation, the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix has only been marketed in one Member State (the Netherlands since May 2003), the safety information available for this product is limited due to a low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonaps can also be used in patients over one month old who have partial lack of enzymes or have a history of hyperammonaemic encephalopathy (brain damage caused by high levels of ammonia).</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonaps is taken in divided doses at meal times, by mouth, mixed with food or through a gastrostomy (tube through the abdomen to the stomach) or nasogastric tube (tube through the nose to the stomach).</seg>
<seg id="2809">(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 86 68 E-mail: mail@emea. europa. eu http: / /www. emea. europa. eu ©EMEA 2006 Reproduction and/ or distribution of this document is authorised for non commercial purposes only provided the EMEA is acknowledged to a placebo (dummy treatment).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonaps may also cause decreased appetite, abnormal blood acidity, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, bad taste or taste aversion, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odour, or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) decided that Ammonaps effectively prevents ammonia levels to become too high in patients who have urea cycle disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonaps was authorised under "Exceptional Circumstances", because, as the disease is rare, limited information was available at the time of approval.</seg>
<seg id="2813">It is indicated in all patients with neonatal-onset presentation (complete enzyme deficiencies, presenting within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">It is also indicated in patients with late-onset disease (partial enzyme deficiencies, presenting after the first month of life) who have a history of hyperammonaemic encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">AMMONAPS is also available as granules for infants, children who are unable to swallow tablets and for patients with dysphagia.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose should be individually adjusted according to the patient ’ s protein tolerance and the daily dietary protein intake needed to promote growth and development.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The usual total daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate in clinical experience is: • 450 - 600 mg/ kg/ day in children weighing less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g/ m2/ day in children weighing more than 20 kg, adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">2 Citrulline or arginine supplementation is required for patients diagnosed with neonatal-onset form of carbamyl phosphate synthetase or ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency at a dose of 0.17 g/ kg/ day or 3.8 g/ m2/ day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Arginine supplementation is required for patients diagnosed with deficiency of argininosuccinate synthetase at a dose of 0.4-0.7 g/ kg/ day or 8.8 - 15.4 g/ m2/ day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets should not be used in patients with dysphagia due to the potential risk of oesophageal ulceration if tablets are not promptly delivered to the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each AMMONAPS tablet contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) of sodium, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) of sodium per 20 g of sodium phenylbutyrate, which is the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency, and in clinical conditions where there is sodium retention with oedema.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since the metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrate involves the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should be used with caution in patients with hepatic or renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The significance of these data in pregnant women is not known; therefore the use of AMMONAPS is contra-indicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">When high doses of phenylacetate (190 - 474 mg/ kg) were given subcutaneously to rat pups, decreased proliferation and increased loss of neurons were observed, as well as a reduction in CNS myelin.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Cerebral synapse maturation was retarded and the number of functioning nerve terminals in the cerebrum was reduced, which resulted in impaired brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It has not been determined if phenylacetate is secreted in human milk and therefore the use of AMMONAPS is contra-indicated during lactation (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, 56% of the patients experienced at least one adverse event and 78% of these adverse events were considered as not related to AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Frequency is defined as very common (≥ 1/ 10), common (≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10) and uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">4 A probable case of toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg/ kg/ d) was reported in an 18-year old anorectic female patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactic acidosis, severe hypokalaemia, pancytopaenia, peripheral neuropathy, and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">One case of overdose occurred in a 5-month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg/ kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms are consistent with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed dose-limiting neurotoxicity when administered intravenously at doses up to 400 mg/ kg/ day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolically active compound that conjugates with glutamine via acetylation to form phenylacetylglutamine which is then excreted by the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">On a molar basis, phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (each containing 2 moles of nitrogen) and therefore provides an alternate vehicle for waste nitrogen excretion.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Based on studies of phenylacetylglutamine excretion in patients with urea cycle disorders it is possible to estimate that, for each gram of sodium phenylbutyrate administered, between 0.12 and 0.15 g of phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen are produced.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is made early and treatment is initiated immediately to improve the survival and the clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">Previously, neonatal-onset presentation of urea cycle disorders was almost universally fatal within the first year of life, even when treated with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or their nitrogen- free analogues.</seg>
<seg id="2838">With haemodialysis, use of alternative waste nitrogen excretion pathways (sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), dietary protein restriction, and, in some cases, essential amino acid supplementation, the survival rate in new-borns diagnosed after birth (but within the first month of life) increased to almost 80% with most deaths occurring during an episode of acute hyperammonaemic encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients diagnosed during gestation and treated prior to any episode of hyperammonaemic encephalopathy, survival was 100%, but even in these patients, many subsequently demonstrated cognitive impairment or other neurologic deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In late-onset deficiency patients, including females heterozygous for ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, who recovered from hyperammonaemic encephalopathy and were then treated chronically with dietary protein restriction and sodium phenylbutyrate, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">5 Reversal of pre-existing neurologic impairment is not likely to occur with treatment, and neurologic deterioration may continue in some patients.</seg>
<seg id="2842">Phenylbutyrate is known to be oxidised to phenylacetate which is enzymatically conjugated with glutamine to form phenylacetylglutamine in the liver and kidney.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Plasma and urine concentrations of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites have been obtained from fasting normal adults who received a single dose of 5 g of sodium phenylbutyrate and from patients with urea cycle disorders, haemoglobinopathies and cirrhosis receiving single and repeated oral doses up to 20 g/ day (uncontrolled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The disposition of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites has also been studied in cancer patients following intravenous infusion of sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g/ m²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After a single oral dose of 5 g of sodium phenylbutyrate, in the form of tablets, measurable plasma levels of phenylbutyrate are detected 15 minutes after dosing.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urea cycle disorders or haemoglobinopathies receiving various doses of phenylbutyrate (300 - 650 mg/ kg/ day up to 20 g/ day) no plasma level of phenylacetate could be detected after overnight fasting.</seg>
<seg id="2847">Three cirrhotic patients (out of 6) who received repeated oral administration of sodium phenylbutyrate (20 g/ day in three doses) showed sustained plasma levels of phenylacetate on the third day that were five times higher than those achieved after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion Approximately 80-100% of the medicinal product is excreted by the kidneys within 24 hours as the conjugated product, phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2849">Micronucleus test results indicate that sodium phenylbutyrate was considered not to have produced any clastogenic effect in rats treated at toxic or non-toxic dose levels (examined 24 and 48 hours after a single oral administration of 878 to 2800 mg/ kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granules should be administered orally (to infants and children unable to swallow tablets and to patients with dysphagia) or via gastrostomy or nasogastric tube.</seg>
<seg id="2851">The usual total daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate in clinical experience is: • 450 - 600 mg/ kg/ day in neonates, infants and children weighing less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g/ m2/ day in children weighing more than 20 kg, adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">Plasma levels of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins should be maintained within normal limits.</seg>
<seg id="2853">Citrulline or arginine supplementation is required for patients diagnosed with neonatal-onset form of carbamyl phosphate synthetase or ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency at a dose of 0.17 g/ kg/ day or 3.8 g/ m2/ day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granules contain 124 mg (5.4 mmol) of sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrate, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) of sodium per 20 g of sodium phenylbutyrate, which is the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">Prenatal exposure of rat pups to phenylacetate (the active metabolite of phenylbutyrate) produced lesions in cortical pyramidal cells; dendritic spines were longer and thinner</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable case of toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg/ kg/ d) was reported in an 18-year old anorectic female patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactic acidosis, severe hypokalaemia, pancytopaenia, peripheral neuropathy, and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">On a molar basis, phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (each containing 2 moles of nitrogen) and therefore provides an alternate vehicle for waste nitrogen excretion.</seg>
<seg id="2858">Based on studies of phenylacetylglutamine excretion in patients with urea cycle disorders it is possible to estimate that, for each gram of sodium phenylbutyrate administered, between 0.12 and 0.15 g of phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen are produced.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Reversal of pre-existing neurologic impairment is not likely to occur with treatment, and neurologic deterioration may continue in some patients.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After a single oral dose of 5 g of sodium phenylbutyrate, in the form of granules, measurable plasma levels of phenylbutyrate are detected 15 minutes after dosing.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the shelf life the patient may store the finished product for a single period of 3 months at a temperature not above 25°C, after which the product must be discarded.</seg>
<seg id="2862">This will give the following doses: small measure 0.95 g, medium measure 2.9 g and large measure 8.6 g of sodium phenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2863">Where a patient requires administration by tube, it is possible to re-constitute AMMONAPS in water prior to use (solubility for sodium phenylbutyrate is up to 5 g in 10 ml water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">Patients with these rare disorders lack certain liver enzymes and are therefore unable to eliminate nitrogen waste, which builds up in the body after eating protein.</seg>
<seg id="2865">AMMONAPS does not completely prevent the occurrence of an acute excess of ammonia in the blood and is not appropriate for treating such a condition, which is a medical emergency.</seg>
<seg id="2866">25 If you require laboratory tests, it is important to remind your doctor that you take AMMONAPS, since sodium phenylbutyrate may influence certain laboratory test results.</seg>
<seg id="2867">Do not use AMMONAPS if you are breast-feeding, since this medicine could pass into the breast-milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">If you take more AMMONAPS than you should Patients who have taken very high doses of AMMONAPS experienced sleepiness, tiredness, light- headedness and less frequently confusion, headache, taste disturbances, decrease in hearing, disorientation, impaired memory and worsening of existing neurological conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you experience any of these symptoms, you should immediately contact your doctor or the nearest hospital emergency department for supportive treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2870">26 If you forget to take AMMONAPS You should take a dose as soon as possible with your next meal.</seg>
<seg id="2871">Common side effects (likely to occur in more than 1 out of 100 persons and less than 1 out of 10 persons): changes in number of blood cells (red cells, white cells and platelets), reduced appetite, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention (swelling), taste disturbances, pain in the abdomen, vomiting, nausea, constipation, skin odour, rash, abnormal kidney function, weight gain and altered laboratory test values.</seg>
<seg id="2872">If any of the side effects get serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2873">Do not use AMMONAPS after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and the bottle label after “ EXP”.</seg>
<seg id="2874">27 What AMMONAPS looks like and contents of the pack AMMONAPS tablets are off-white, oval and embossed with “ UCY 500”.</seg>
<seg id="2875">AMMONAPS does not completely prevent the occurrence of an acute excess of ammonia in the blood and is not appropriate for treating such a condition, which is a medical emergency.</seg>
<seg id="2876">If you require laboratory tests, it is important to remind your doctor that you take AMMONAPS, since sodium phenylbutyrate may influence certain laboratory test results.</seg>
<seg id="2877">You should take AMMONAPS in equally divided doses by mouth, through a gastrostomy (tube through the abdomen to the stomach) or through a nasogastric tube (tube through the nose to the stomach).</seg>
<seg id="2878">0.95 g = small spoon, 2.9 g = medium sized spoon and 8.6 g = large spoon • Take a heaped spoonful of granules out of the bottle • Pass a flat surface, e. g. the back of a knife blade, over the top of the spoon to remove the excess of granules • The granules left in the spoon are one spoonful • Take the correct number of spoonful granules from the bottle</seg>
<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adults with ‘ acute coronary syndromes’ (ACS, reduced blood flow to the heart), such as unstable angina (a type of chest pain that varies in severity) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without ‘ ST segment elevation’ (an abnormal reading on the electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">When used to prevent blood clots in patients undergoing PCI, a higher dose of Angiox is used, and the infusion may be continued for up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help the flow of blood to the heart to be maintained in patients with angina or who are having a heart attack and can improve the effectiveness of PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">For the treatment of ACS, the main study involved almost 14,000 patients and compared the effectiveness of Angiox, taken alone or with a glycoprotein IIb/ IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another type of medicine that helps to prevent blood clots), with the standard treatment combination of heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, patients often had a stent inserted (a short tube that remains in the artery to stop it closing), and they also received other medicines that help to prevent blood clots, such as abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">When used to treat ACS, Angiox, taken with or without a GPI, was as effective as the standard treatment in preventing the overall number of new events (deaths, heart attacks or revascularisations) after 30 days and after a year.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients undergoing PCI, Angiox was as effective as heparin in all measures, except major bleeding, for which it was significantly better than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to bivalirudin, other hirudins, or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It should also not be used in patients who have had recent bleeding, who have severe high blood pressure or severe kidney problems, or a heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is an acceptable substitute for heparin in the treatment of ACS and during PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Angiox to The Medicines Company UK Ltd on 20 September 2004.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina/ non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (UA/ NSTEMI)) planned for urgent or early intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended starting dose of Angiox for patients with ACS is an intravenous bolus of 0.1 mg/ kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg/ kg/ h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If the patient proceeds to PCI, an additional bolus of 0.5 mg/ kg should be administered and the infusion increased to 1.75 mg/ kg/ h for the duration of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2893">Following PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg/ kg/ h may be resumed for 4 to 12 hours as clinically necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Just prior to surgery, a 0.5mg/ kg bolus dose should be administered followed by a 1.75mg/ kg/ h infusion for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dose of Angiox for patients undergoing PCI is an intravenous bolus of 0.75 mg/ kg body weight followed immediately by an intravenous infusion at a rate of 1.75 mg/ kg body weight/ hour for at least the duration of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a bolus only dose of Angiox has not been evaluated and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If the 5-minute ACT is less than 225 seconds, a second bolus dose of 0.3 mg/ kg should be administered.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the potential for low ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted product should be thoroughly mixed prior to administration and the bolus dose administered by a rapid intravenous push.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT value is greater than 225 seconds, no further monitoring is required provided the 1.75mg/ kg infusion dose is properly administered.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR 30-59ml/ min) undergoing PCI (whether being treated with bivalirudin for ACS or not) should receive a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg/ kg/ h.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT is less than 225 seconds, a second bolus dose of 0.3 mg/ kg should be administered and the ACT re-checked 5 minutes after the administration of the second bolus dose.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate renal impairment included in a pivotal phase III PCI study (REPLACE-2) ACT values assessed 5 minutes after bivalirudin bolus averaged 366 +/ - 89 seconds with no dose adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Angiox is contraindicated in patients with severe renal insufficiency (GFR < 30ml/ min) and also in dialysis-dependent patients (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Patients can be started on Angiox 30 minutes after discontinuation of unfractionated heparin given intravenously, or 8 hours after discontinuation of low molecular weight heparin given subcutaneously.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• a known hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients, or to hirudins • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding because of haemostasis disorders and/ or irreversible coagulation disorders • severe uncontrolled hypertension and subacute bacterial endocarditis • severe renal impairment (GFR < 30ml/ min) and in dialysis-dependent patients.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients must be observed carefully for symptoms and signs of bleeding during treatment particularly if bivalirudin is combined with another anticoagulant (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Although most bleeding associated with bivalirudin occurs at the site of arterial puncture in patients undergoing PCI, haemorrhage can occur at any site during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients taking warfarin who are treated with bivalirudin, International Normalised Ratio (INR) monitoring should be considered to ensure that it returns to pre-treatment levels following discontinuation of bivalirudin treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">From the knowledge of their mechanism of action, combined use of anti-coagulant medicinal products (heparin, warfarin, thrombolytics or antiplatelet agents) can be expected to increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In any case, when bivalirudin is combined with a platelet inhibitor or an anticoagulant drug, clinical and biological parameters of haemostasis should be regularly monitored.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Animal studies are insufficient with respect to effects on pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, parturition or post- natal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">The following adverse reaction data are based on a clinical study of bivalirudin in 13,819 patients with ACS; 4612 were randomised to bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomised to bivalirudin plus GPIIb/ IIIa inhibitor and 4603 were randomised to either unfractionated heparin or enoxaparin plus GPIIb/ IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Adverse reactions were more frequent in females and in patients more than 65 years of age in both the bivalirudin and the heparin-treated comparator groups compared to male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Major bleeding was measured by the ACUITY and TIMI major bleeding scales as defined in the footnotes to Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both major and minor bleeds were significantly less frequent with bivalirudin alone than the heparin plus GPIIb/ IIIa inhibitor and bivalirudin plus GPIIb/ IIIa inhibitor groups (see Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">ACUITY major bleeding defined as any one of the following: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular, access site haemorrhage requiring radiological or surgical intervention, ≥ 5cm diameter haematoma at puncture site, reduction in haemoglobin concentration of ≥ 4g/ dL without an overt source of bleeding, reduction in haemaglobin concentration of ≥ 3g/ dL with an overt source of bleeding, re-operation for bleeding, use of any blood product transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Other less frequently observed bleeding sites with greater than 0.1% (uncommon) bleeding included “ other” puncture site, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following adverse reaction data is based on a clinical study of bivalirudin in 6000 patients undergoing PCI, half of whom were treated with bivalirudin (REPLACE-2).</seg>
<seg id="2919">Adverse events were more frequent in females and in patients more than 65 years of age in both the bivalirudin and the heparin-treated comparator groups compared to male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both minor and major bleeds were significantly less frequent with bivalirudin than the heparin plus GPIIb/ IIIa inhibitor comparator group.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Adverse reactions that have been reported from extensive post-marketing experience and that have not been reported above are summarised by system organ class in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In cases of overdose, treatment with bivalirudin should be immediately discontinued and the patient monitored closely for signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivalirudin, a direct and specific thrombin inhibitor that binds both to the catalytic site and the anion-binding exosite of fluid-phase and clot-bound thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of bivalirudin to thrombin, and therefore its activity, is reversible as thrombin slowly cleaves the bivalirudin, Arg3-Pro4, bond, resulting in recovery of thrombin active site function.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In vitro studies have also shown that bivalirudin prolongs the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) thrombin time (TT) and pro-thrombin time (PT) of normal human plasma in a concentration- dependent manner and that bivalirudin does not induce a platelet aggregation response against sera from patients with a history of Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia/ Thrombosis Syndrome (HIT/ HITTS).</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and patients, bivalirudin exhibits dose- and concentration dependent anticoagulant activity as evidenced as prolongation of the ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">For patients undergoing PCI, an additional IV bolus of 0.5mg/ kg bivalirudin was administered and the rate of IV infusion increased to 1.75 mg/ kg/ h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">10 In Arm A of the ACUITY trial, UFH or enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the management of ACS in patients with UA and NSTEMI.</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in Arms A and B were also randomised to receive a GPIIb/ IIIa inhibitor either upfront at the time of randomization (prior to angiography) or at the time of PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">High risk patient characteristics of the ACUITY population that mandated angiography within 72 hours were balanced across the three treatment arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Approximately 77% of patients had recurrent ischaemia, approximately 70% had dynamic ECG changes or elevated cardiac biomarkers, approximately 28% had diabetes and approximately 99% of patients underwent angiography within 72 hours.</seg>

<seg id="2938">The 30-day results based on quadruple and triple endpoints from a randomized, double-blind trial of over 6,000 patients undergoing PCI (REPLACE-2), are shown in Table 10.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Clinical trials in a small number of patients have provided limited information about the use of Angiox in patients with HIT/ HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacokinetic properties of bivalirudin have been evaluated and found to be linear in patients undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention and in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">As a peptide, bivalirudin is expected to undergo catabolism to its constituent amino acids, with subsequent recycling of the amino acid in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabolite resulting from the cleavage of Arg3-Pro4 bond of the N-terminal sequence by thrombin is not active because of the loss of affinity to the catalytic active site of thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Elimination follows a first order process with a terminal half-life of 25 ± 12 minutes in patients with normal renal function.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety, pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, or toxicity to reproduction.</seg>
<seg id="2945">Toxicity in animals upon repeated or continuous exposure (1 day to 4 weeks at exposure levels of up to 10 times the clinical steady state plasma concentration) was limited to exaggerated pharmacological effects.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Undesirable effects that resulted from prolonged physiological stress in response to a non-homeostatic state of coagulation were not seen after short exposure comparable to that in clinical use, even at much higher doses.</seg>
<seg id="2947">If not used immediately, in use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2 – 8 oC, unless reconstitution/ dilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children aged six years or over who have diabetes and need insulin treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is given subcutaneously (under the skin) by injection in the abdominal wall (tummy), the thigh, or the upper arm, or by continuous infusion using an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of glucose in the blood or when the body is unable to use insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">The difference means that insulin glulisine acts more rapidly, and has a shorter duration of action than a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra, used in combination with a long-acting insulin, has been studied in patients with type 1 diabetes (when the body cannot produce insulin) in two studies involving a total of 1,549 adults and in one study involving 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes (when the body is unable to use insulin effectively), Apidra has been studied in one study involving 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main measure of effectiveness was the change in the blood levels of a substance called glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), which gives an indication of how well blood glucose is controlled.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, there was a decrease of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) after six months, compared with a decrease of 0.14% for insulin lispro.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, there was a decrease in HbA1c of 0.46% after six months of Apidra, compared with 0.30% for regular human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin glulisine or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who already have hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">Apidra doses might need to be adjusted when given with some other medicines that may have an effect on blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for Apidra to Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH on 27 September 2004.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra should be administered subcutaneously in the abdominal wall, thigh or deltoid or by continuous infusion in the abdominal wall.</seg>
<seg id="2978">In patients with hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced capacity for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, etc.), species (animal) and/ or method of manufacturing may result in a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2980">The use of inadequate dosages or discontinuation of treatment, especially in insulin-dependent diabetic, may lead to hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; conditions which are potentially lethal.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Switching a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical supervision and may require change in dose.</seg>
<seg id="2982">Hypoglycaemia The time of occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the action profile of the insulins used and may, therefore, change when the treatment regimen is changed.</seg>
<seg id="2983">Substances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering activity and increase susceptibility to hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic agents, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamide oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal reproduction studies have not revealed any differences between insulin glulisine and human insulin regarding pregnancy, embryonal/ foetal development, parturition or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is unknown whether insulin glulisine is excreted in human milk, but in general insulin does not pass into breast milk and is not absorbed after oral administration.</seg>
<seg id="2987">The following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations were listed below by system organ class and in order of decreasing incidence (very common: ≥ 1/ 10; common: ≥ 1/ 100 to < 1/ 10; uncommon: ≥ 1/ 1,000 to < 1/ 100; rare: ≥ 1/ 10,000 to < 1/ 1,000; very rare: < 1/ 10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).</seg>
<seg id="2988">They may include cold sweats, cool pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiousness, unusual tiredness or weakness, confusion, difficulty in concentration, drowsiness, excessive hunger, vision changes, headache, nausea and palpitation.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site as a consequence of failure to rotate injection sites within an area.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycaemic episodes, where the patient has become unconscious, can be treated by glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) given intramuscularly or subcutaneously by a person who has received appropriate instruction, or by glucose given intravenously by a medical professional.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After an injection of glucagon, the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to find the reason for this severe hypoglycaemia and prevent other similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulins lower blood glucose levels by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies in healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes demonstrated that insulin glulisine is more rapid in onset of action and of shorter duration of action than regular human insulin when given subcutaneously.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male subjects with diabetes mellitus type 1 aged 21 to 50 years, insulin glulisine displayed dose-proportional glucose lowering effect in the therapeutic relevant dose range 0.075 to 0.15 U/ kg, and less than proportional increase in glucose lowering effect with 0.3 U/ kg or higher, like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin glulisine takes effect about twice as fast as regular human insulin and completes the glucose lowering effect about 2 hours earlier than regular human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">6 administered 2 minutes before the meal gives similar postprandial glycemic control compared to regular human insulin given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">When given 2 minutes prior to meal, insulin glulisine provided better postprandial control than regular human insulin given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Insulin glulisine administered 15 minutes after starting the meal gives similar glycemic control as regular human insulin given 2 minutes before the meal (see figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin glulisine given 2 minutes (GLULISINE pre) before the start of a meal compared to regular human insulin given 30 minutes (REGULAR 30 min) before the start of the meal (figure 1A) and compared to regular human insulin given 2 minutes (REGULAR pre) before a meal (figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin glulisine given 15 minutes (GLULISINE post) after start of a meal compared to regular human insulin given 2 minutes (REGULAR pre) before start of the meal (figure 1C).</seg>
