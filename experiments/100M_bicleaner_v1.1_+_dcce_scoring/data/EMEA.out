the present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets ( tablets that dis@@ solve in the mouth ) , as a solution for taking ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ l thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or vision of things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and del@@ usion ; • Bi@@ polar disorder , a mental illness in which the patients have various epis@@ odes ( periods of ab@@ normal high @-@ tuning ) altern@@ ating with periods of normal mood .
A@@ bili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe mental epis@@ odes and for prevention of man@@ ic epis@@ odes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces if the oral consumption of the medication is not possible .
in both cases , the solution can be applied or the melting tablets are used in patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
in patients who take other medicines at the same time , same as A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose of A@@ bili@@ fy should be adjusted .
this affects the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of nerve cells to each other .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol pres@@ um@@ ably appears as a &quot; partial ag@@ onist &quot; for the recep@@ tors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( also called ser@@ ot@@ onin ) .
this means that ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole acts like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and dop@@ amine , but in lesser degree than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter to activate recep@@ tors .
as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and prevents its recur@@ rence .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms has been studied in three studies over up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases , which suffered from increased un@@ rest , over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo .
in another study A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in another study , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to prevent recur@@ rence of 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that suffered from increased un@@ rest , with which from Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in patients &quot; symptoms based on a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to treatment was investigated .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body res@@ or@@ b@@ ates the melting tablets and the solution for intake .
in the two studies with the injection solution patients demonstrated A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9,75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased un@@ rest than the patients receiving plac@@ ebo .
in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ term studies man@@ ic symptoms more effective than plac@@ ebo .
A@@ bili@@ fy also prevented the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic epis@@ odes with previously treated patients for up to 74 weeks and when it was ad@@ ministered in addition to an existing treatment .
bili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses also reduced more effectively than plac@@ ebo , symptoms of increased un@@ rest and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common A@@ bili@@ fy side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ yr@@ amid@@ ale dis@@ rup@@ tions , tre@@ mor ( tre@@ mb@@ ase ) , sed@@ ation , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ) , ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( increased s@@ ali@@ va production ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in treating schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic epis@@ odes in bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic epis@@ odes and in which the man@@ ic epis@@ odes addressed the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , out@@ weigh the risks .
in addition , the Committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of the injection solution in rapid control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ oral disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , if oral therapy is not appropriate , out@@ weigh the risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Phar@@ maceutical Europe Ltd . a permit for the placing of A@@ bili@@ fy in the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ bili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic epis@@ odes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mostly man@@ ic epis@@ odes and whose man@@ ic epis@@ odes addressed the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
increased effectiveness of dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of the meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors are justified ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ icide behavior belongs to psych@@ otic illnesses and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after a change of an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , there was no increased risk of su@@ icide with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol compared to other anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency , con@@ duction disorders ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , treatment with blood @-@ lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports on dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
if the symptoms and symptoms of late dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia are treated with A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
when a patient develops signs and symptoms pointing to a M@@ NS , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be removed .
therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be applied with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or at states associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years old with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease had patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , an increased risk of death compared to plac@@ ebo .
however , there was in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response for adverse cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treated patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extreme and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ do@@ sis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there are no exact risk assess@@ ments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia related adverse events in patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents that allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes Mell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes Mell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with regard to deteri@@ oration of glu@@ cose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar deficiency , the use of anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a secondary effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with over@@ lying side effects such as sed@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .
in a clinical trial with healthy subjects , a highly effective C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore should be similar dose @-@ re@@ ductions .
in C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabolism can result in the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol compared to C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sion@@ ers .
considering the common administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , potential benefits should weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , such as it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore should be similar dose @-@ re@@ ductions .
after the C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dosage height prior to the start of the accompanying therapy .
Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are ad@@ ministered together with A@@ bili@@ fy , can be expected with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical studies , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an @-@ R@@ atio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ ium ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
due to the in@@ adequate data situation for safety in humans and due to the concerns raised in re@@ productive studies , this drug may not be used in pregnancy unless the possible benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk of the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against dangerous machines including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole does not have any negative impact on them .
the following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the inci@@ dence of side effects mentioned below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of over 52 weeks , in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , a total decreased inci@@ dence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ ogenic , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS was 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with plac@@ ebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol was 15.@@ 1 % in patients with or@@ tho@@ sis therapy .
man@@ ic epis@@ odes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ i@@ dol treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the inci@@ dence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely monitored laboratory parameters did not result in un@@ medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine phosph@@ ate kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the side effects associated with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy are the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia and sei@@ zur@@ es , undes@@ irable cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events and increased mort@@ ality in older demen@@ tia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes Mell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death sequence .
there is no information about the effectiveness of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of an over@@ dose , since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol has a high plas@@ map@@ rot@@ ein bonding .
it is thought that the efficacy of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder is medi@@ ated over the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recep@@ tors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tors .
in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol demonstrated a high aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 recep@@ tor and ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a recep@@ tor as well as an even aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and hi@@ stam@@ ine H@@ 1@@ recep@@ tor .
during the dose of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for two weeks of healthy subjects , the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 recep@@ tor lig@@ ands , nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at the put@@ ative .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a semi @-@ eri@@ i@@ dol @-@ controlled trial in week 52 the share of respon@@ der patients , who retained a response to the study medication , was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales defined as secondary studies including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depression rate scale showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a significantly higher reduction in the decline rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol group and at 57 % below plac@@ ebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in controlled , multin@@ ational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients treated and in which the primary study was &apos; weight gain &apos; , in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trials with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol demonstrated a proven efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to plac@@ ebo .
in two plac@@ ebo@@ - and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol demonstrated a efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect that was comparable to that of Lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 .
in addition , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ie in week 12 such as lithium or semi @-@ op@@ eri@@ i@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which in some cases did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy with therapeutic ser@@ um mirrors , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol demonstrated a superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension of over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol before random@@ isation a re@@ mission occurred , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to plac@@ ebo with regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar decline , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ie .
based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xi@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ formulation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in extensive metabolism via C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) met@@ abolic rollers via C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients had no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a population @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics gave no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to eth@@ ni@@ cal belonging or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy subjects .
a single dose study in subjects with various liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the imp@@ air@@ ment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their met@@ abolic capacity .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated administration , re@@ productive tox@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and the car@@ cin@@ ogenic potential , the pre@@ clinical data did not reveal any particular haz@@ ards to humans .
tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only with dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent side @-@ kidney tox@@ icity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ Pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the average Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10 times the average Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dosage in humans ) .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the ero@@ sion of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bile of mon@@ key after repeated oral exposure of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dosage or the 16@@ - to 81@@ eys of the recommended maximum dosage in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations of the sul@@ fate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gate of hydro@@ xy@@ - ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were not more than 6 % of concentrations observed in the study over 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of apes , and are far below the limits ( 6 % ) of in vitro sol@@ ub@@ ility .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages that led to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 times of the average Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution is used for fast control of ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic epis@@ odes of bi@@ polar disorder , if oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution should be termin@@ ated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
to increase res@@ or@@ ption and minimize the vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended in obes@@ e regions .
a lower dose of 5,@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) may be given depending on individual clinical status , taking into account the medicines used already for maintenance or acute treatment ( see section 4.5 ) .
if a further or@@ ale treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is indicated , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy Schmel@@ z@@ tabl@@ etten or A@@ bili@@ fy solution for inclusion .

if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution , patients should be observed with regard to extreme sed@@ ation or blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) .
investigations on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution are not available for patients suffering from alcohol or drugs poison@@ ing ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency , con@@ duction disorders ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , treatment with blood @-@ lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .
Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports on dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a M@@ NS are high fever , muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness , changing consciousness levels and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhyth@@ ms ) .
Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with regard to deteri@@ oration of glu@@ cose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar deficiency because of com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a secondary effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was greater compared to the all@@ ot@@ ment of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , in a study where healthy subjects were used as an intr@@ am@@ us@@ cular response ( 15 mg dose ) and which at the same time received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intr@@ am@@ us@@ cular .

107 The following adverse events occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified in clinical studies with oral Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS 19 % in patients with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients was plac@@ ebo .
in another study over 12 weeks , the inci@@ dence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the inci@@ dence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 15.@@ 7 % was treated with plac@@ ebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and plac@@ ebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely monitored laboratory parameters did not result in un@@ medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ phosph@@ ate kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the side effects associated with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy are the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , undes@@ irable cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events and increased mort@@ ality in older demen@@ tia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ oral dis@@ rup@@ tions , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution was compared with statisti@@ cally significant improvements in Agi@@ str@@ ag@@ it@@ eness / behavi@@ oral dys@@ functions compared to plac@@ ebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as Agi@@ ot@@ ti@@ zation and behavi@@ oral dis@@ rup@@ tions , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms regarding the Agi@@ on and behavi@@ oral dys@@ functions compared to plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the mean improvement of the initial value at the PAN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Com@@ ponent score on the primary 2 @-@ hour final point was 5.@@ 8 for plac@@ ebo , 9,@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed epis@@ odes or patients with severe ag@@ ility , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be detected due to reduced patient numbers .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a semi @-@ eri@@ i@@ dol @-@ controlled trial in week 52 the share of respon@@ der patients , who retained a response to the study medication , was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study targets including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ gom@@ ery As@@ berg depression scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( or@@ ally ) showed a significantly higher reduction in the decline rate , which was 34 % in the ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and at 57 % below plac@@ ebo .
in an or@@ eline controlled , multin@@ ational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 314 patients treated and in which the primary study was &apos; weight gain &apos; , a weight gain of at least 7 % rose compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca .

in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who had reached a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol demonstrated against plac@@ ebo with regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar decline , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ie .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol AU@@ C is 90 % greater in the first 2 hours after intr@@ am@@ us@@ cular injection as a tablet ; system@@ ic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy subjects , the mean time to reach the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injection solution was well toler@@ ated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct tox@@ icity of a target organ after repeated use during a system@@ ic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , the 15@@ - and 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intr@@ am@@ us@@ cular lay .
in studies of re@@ productive tox@@ icity after intra@@ ven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ relevant concerns were found in mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on the conventional studies with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated administration , re@@ productive tox@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and the car@@ cin@@ ogenic potential , the pre@@ clinical data did not reveal any particular haz@@ ards to humans .
tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only with dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; therefore , they have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent side @-@ kidney tox@@ icity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ Pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to 3 to 10 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dosage in humans ) .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the ero@@ sion of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bile of mon@@ key after repeated oral exposure of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1- to 3 times of the recommended maximum @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dosage or the 16 - to 81 @-@ fold of the recommended maximum dosage in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages that led to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the mean steady @-@ state EY@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metast@@ atic breast cancer , of which about three quarters were formerly an anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in the sole gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
in total , the main study was 72 ( 31 % ) of the patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane in the treatment of 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el treatments .
if one considers only those patients treated for metast@@ atic breast cancer , there was no difference between the efficacy indicators like time and the wor@@ sen@@ ing of the disease and survival .
in contrast , patients who had previously received other treatments for their metast@@ atic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
it may not be used in patients who breast@@ feed or have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood before the treatment begins .
the CH@@ MP medical drug ( CH@@ MP ) committee noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane was no more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and that in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs , it would not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission issued Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane throughout the European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metast@@ atic breast cancer in patients where the first @-@ line therapy for metast@@ atic disease is missing and for which a standard anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine therapy is not indicated ( see also Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ enia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 treatment must be interrupted until a recovery is achieved to grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate imp@@ air@@ ment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies were conducted with patients with imp@@ aired kidney function and there is currently no adequate data to recommend dose adjustments in patients with imp@@ air@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data about safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an Alb@@ um@@ in @-@ based nano @-@ artic@@ ulated formulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could have other pharmac@@ ological features than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment should be initiated and the patient should not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el again .
in patients no new Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the number of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes has increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly associated cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity was not proven , cardi@@ ac inci@@ dents in the indicated patient group are not unusual , especially in patients with early anth@@ rac@@ y@@ cl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
if in patients after the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting and di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea occur , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ tive methods .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be applied to pregnant women or women at child@@ bearing age , which are not effective contrac@@ eption , except treatment of mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is unavoid@@ able .
women at child@@ bearing age should use a reliable method of contrac@@ eption during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to produce no child during and up to six months after treatment .
male patients should be advised before the treatment of a sper@@ ma@@ therapy because of the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane , the possibility of irre@@ versible in@@ fertility exists .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects like ti@@ red@@ ness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can affect the traffic ti@@ ghtness and the ability to serve machines .
the following are the most common and most important inci@@ dents of side effects performed in 229 patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer which were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 abra@@ sives in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study .
neut@@ rop@@ enia was the most con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly re@@ versible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) in three cases .
in Table 1 , the side effects performed in conjunction with the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in each dose and indication occurred in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased l@@ act@@ ate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased levels of cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced pot@@ assi@@ um in blood heart disease :

pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules active substance that promotes the inter@@ storage of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ular indi@@ ans and stabili@@ zes mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by in@@ hibition of their poly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital interim period and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ oc@@ t@@ ose of plasma components into the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells and in @-@ vitro studies it has been demonstrated that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ li@@ ial transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ um@@ ming recep@@ tor and occurs due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( secre@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the area of the tumour .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metast@@ atic breast cancer is supported by 106 patients in two un@@ armed un@@ verb@@ al studies and 454 patients treated in a Phase III random@@ ised trial .
in a study , 43 patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an inf@@ usion of over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as inf@@ usion in 63 minutes to 63 patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer .
this multi @-@ cent@@ ric study was performed in patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer , which received mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el every 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion without pre@@ medication ( N = 229 ) .
in the study 64 % of patients had an imp@@ aired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had previously received chemotherapy , 27 % only had a adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only due to metast@@ ases and 19 % due to metast@@ as@@ ation and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the general response rate and time until progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who receive first @-@ line therapy are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity compared to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by improving a degree for patients who experienced peri@@ ph@@ ere Neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy for reducing bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown .
the Phar@@ mac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute inf@@ usions of abra@@ sives with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was measured in clinical studies .
the active substance exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml analogue to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 The pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration in patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer in patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dosage of 260 mg / m2 declined in a multi@@ phase mode .
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates a far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ as@@ cular distribution and / or crossover linking of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with patients with advanced solid tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared with the values of a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the clearance of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ giving ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the volume of distribution was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily metaboli@@ zed to 6@@ α hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and two smaller met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute inf@@ usion of 260 mg / m2 with metast@@ atic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ure@@ a separation of the unchanged active substance was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the total met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearance .
however , only a few data are available about patients at the age of 75 , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box and protected against light light over 8 hours .

this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; reference drug &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood vessels that could occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion complications , if a blood @-@ don@@ or is not possible in case of a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml .
the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with disorders that the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
the injection can also be made by the patient or his super@@ visor as long as they have received appropriate instructions .
in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be in the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron levels of all patients are checked before the treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists , and iron supplements should be ad@@ ministered during the entire treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , ana@@ emia can be caused by an er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ ine deficiency or that the body does not adequ@@ ately respond to the body &apos;s er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell containing a gene ( DNA ) , which it enables to formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to injection in a v@@ ein as part of a major study involving 479 patients who suffered from kidney problems caused an@@ emia , compared to the reference drug .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected in E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o for at least eight weeks before they were either converted to ab@@ se@@ amed or received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the change in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of ab@@ se@@ amed under the skin were examined with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study involving patients suffering from ana@@ emia caused by ren@@ al problems , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who were converted to ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained in the same extent as with those patients who received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is a rise in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , pier@@ cing mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion .
ab@@ se@@ amed should not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or one of the other ingredients .
ren@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that there are no allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed according to the European Union regulations , evidence was provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that provides Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for medical professionals in all member states including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company Medi@@ ce Arzneimittel P@@ ütter GmbH &amp; Co KG a permit for the placing of ab@@ se@@ amed in the entire European Union .
treatment of ana@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion demand in adults with solid tum@@ ours , mal@@ ign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multi@@ ple@@ m my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing ana@@ emia in the beginning of chemotherapy ) .
treatment should only be carried out in patients with moderate ana@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6,@@ 2 - 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , in case of planned larger surgical interventions , which require a large blood volume substitute ( 4 or more units blood in women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) .
Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used to reduce external blood &apos;s blood from a large elec@@ tive orth@@ op@@ a@@ edi@@ c intervention in adults with no iron deficiency , where a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected .
HB 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected loss of blood from 900 @-@ 1800 ml are applied , which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ at@@ ric patients , where the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) should lie .
symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease load ; therefore the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required by the physician .
a rise in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in a patient or under the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .
given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month , or if the durable hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest approved dose , which is required for the control of ana@@ emia and ana@@ emia .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial ana@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial ana@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dosage 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week with intra@@ ven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
ana@@ emia symptoms and follow @-@ up symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease load ; therefore , the assessment of individual clinical trials and condition of disease is required by the physician .
given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose , which is required for the control of ana@@ emia &apos;s symptoms .
if after 4 treatment weeks the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cycles value increased to ≥ 4@@ 0,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be retained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ascent &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ te number &lt; 40.000 cells / µl compared to the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if after another 4 treatment weeks with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week of the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cycles of ≥ 4@@ 0,000 cells / µl , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week .

patients with mild ana@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood preser@@ ves is required should receive Ab@@ se@@ amed in a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery .
the iron substitu@@ tion should be started as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - to prevent large iron reserves prior to the beginning of the Ab@@ se@@ amed therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given weekly over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ E. / kg every 10 consecutive days , on the day of the surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis can be given over the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug in the circulation .
patients who are diagnosed with any er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin on a er@@ y@@ thro@@ blast@@ op@@ en@@ ie ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive ab@@ se@@ amed or other er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - er@@ y@@ thro@@ blast@@ op@@ en@@ ie ) .
heart attack or stroke within a month prior to treatment , inst@@ ab@@ ile ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ estic , ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) .
in patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orth@@ op@@ a@@ edi@@ c surgery and which can not participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , the use of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , esc@@ ort or vas@@ cular diseases : severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , vas@@ cular disease of car@@ ot@@ oti@@ des or cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease ; in patients with a short heart attack or cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular event .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ blast@@ op@@ en@@ ie ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely reported on the occurrence of an anti@@ body medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin .
in patients with sudden effect loss , defined as reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ f@@ usions , the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ te value should be determined and the usual causes for non @-@ use ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umini@@ ums tox@@ ic@@ ation , infections or infections , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are investigated .
if the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ te value , taking into consideration the an@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten &quot; index &quot; ) , is reduced ( &lt; 20.000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / Mik@@ rol@@ iter or &lt; 0,5 % ) , the thro@@ cy@@ tes and leu@@ k@@ oc@@ y@@ tes are normal , and if no other cause of active loss is found , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ marks for the diagnosis of a PR@@ CA should be considered .
data on immun@@ ogen@@ icity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of anti@@ body @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic kidney failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration under section 4.2 .
in clinical studies , increased mort@@ ality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimul@@ ating agents ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit due to the addition of epo@@ et@@ ines , if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required for the control of ana@@ emia symptoms and the avo@@ idance of blood trans@@ f@@ usions .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ascent should amount to approximately 1 g / dl ( 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hyper@@ tension .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evident cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or in@@ suffici@@ ency , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration under section 4.2 .
according to the present knowledge , the treatment of ana@@ emia with ep@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is not accelerated in adults with kidney failure , which are not di@@ aly@@ sis , the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency is not accelerated .
for tumour patients with chemotherapy , a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa and er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin response should be considered for assess@@ ing the therapeutic efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin response ( patients who need to be trans@@ co@@ ded ) .
if the H@@ b increase is exceeded 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 , in order to minimize the risk of potential thro@@ mb@@ otic events ( see section 4.2 ) treatment of patients with chem@@ o@@ therapeutic an@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk @-@ weighing under the involvement of the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are en@@ vis@@ aged for a greater elec@@ tive orth@@ op@@ a@@ edi@@ c surgery , if possible , prior to the beginning of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa treatment , the cause of ana@@ emia is investigated and treated accordingly .
patients who undergo a major elec@@ tive orth@@ op@@ a@@ edi@@ c surgery should receive appropriate th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis , since they have an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic and vas@@ cular diseases , especially with a underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it can not be excluded that in treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an output rate of &gt; 13 g / dl a higher risk of post@@ operative thro@@ mb@@ otic / vas@@ cular events can exist .
in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ins were not proven that they improve overall survival in tumor patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic ana@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metast@@ atic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , when hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration was initiated from 12 to 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.8 m@@ mo@@ l / l )
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose should be adjusted to the rising ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t .
in vitro studies on tumour tissues there is no evidence of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation .
thro@@ mb@@ otic , vas@@ cular events such as m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular attacks , vas@@ cular thro@@ mb@@ oses , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , an@@ eur@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ sis , retin@@ al@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses , and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kid@@ neys was reported in patients with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treatment , as well as patients suffering from epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the wor@@ sen@@ ing of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased inci@@ dence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vas@@ cular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients under treatment with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ines .
independent of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treatment , patients with cardiovascular and vas@@ cular complications can occur in patients with cardiovascular and vas@@ cular diseases .
the gene@@ tically derived epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ fied and in relation to the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate part identical to the endo@@ genous human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ em@@ ic patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is specifically stimul@@ ated the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and the leu@@ kop@@ o@@ ese is not affected .

survival and tumour progression were studied in five large controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo controlled studies and
in the open trial , there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin and control patients .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin showed an un@@ explained , statisti@@ cally significant increase in mort@@ ality due to several common mal@@ ign@@ ancies .
overall survival in studies could not be explained by differences in the inci@@ dence of thro@@ mb@@ oses and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin and with controls .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumor patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
it is not clari@@ fied how far these results are applied to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , since too few patients were included with these characteristics in the reviewed data .
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ determin@@ ations after repeated intra@@ ven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy subjects and a slightly prolonged half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
according to sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the ser@@ um levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the ser@@ um levels achieved by intra@@ ven@@ ous inj@@ ections .
there is no accumulation : the ser@@ um levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a well known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be caused by secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ di@@ sm or unknown factors .

during treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed it can result in a light dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets within the normal range resulting in further treatment .
your doctor may conduct regular blood tests in order to regularly check the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
lack of iron , dis@@ solution of the red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12@@ - or acid deficiency should be taken into account and treated with ab@@ se@@ amed before the start of treatment .
very rare was reported on the occurrence of an anti@@ body @-@ medi@@ ated er@@ y@@ thro@@ blast@@ oc@@ ene after months to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin jump@@ ed ) er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin .
if you suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ blast@@ op@@ en@@ ie , he will ab@@ ort your therapy with ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your ana@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection into a v@@ ein ( intra@@ ven@@ ously ) if you are treated for ana@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
if increased or increased pot@@ assi@@ um mirrors , your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed until the pot@@ assi@@ um values are again in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney clean@@ se and clin@@ ically clear cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion signs by in@@ adequate heart rate , your doctor will make sure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value .
according to the present knowledge , the treatment of blood vessels with ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ gift and desired effect should be considered for assess@@ ing the effectiveness of ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your ab@@ se@@ amed dose to keep the risk of blood @-@ dro@@ pping ( thro@@ mb@@ otic event ) as low as possible .
this risk should be weigh@@ ed carefully over the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic vas@@ cular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( obes@@ e ) or if in the past already thro@@ mb@@ otic vas@@ cular events have occurred ( e.g. a deep ven@@ ous bub@@ ble or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ lie ) .
if you are cancer patients , remember that Ab@@ se@@ amed will act as a growth factor for blood cells and may have a negative impact on the tumour under certain circumstances .
if you want a larger orth@@ op@@ a@@ edi@@ c surgery , before treatment begins with ab@@ se@@ amed the cause of your ana@@ emia is examined and treated accordingly .
if your values of the red blood pigment ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive Ab@@ se@@ amed , because there is an increased risk of ble@@ eding after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have been taken / used recently , even if it is not prescription drugs .
if you use C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may prescri@@ be certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have shown no inter@@ play between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF ( G @-@ C@@ SF and GM @-@ C@@ SF are means of building up the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or for HIV ) .
depending on how your ana@@ emia ( ana@@ emia ) is addressing the treatment , the dose can be adjusted about every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor may , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the treatment success and ensure that the medicine works correctly and your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
once you are well set , you will receive regular doses of Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , spread over two equally large inj@@ ections .
your doctor may , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a particular value .
depending on how an@@ emia is addressing the treatment , the dose can be adjusted about every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to ensure this and ensure that the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a particular value , the attending physician will perform regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to sh@@ orten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of the operation and another 4 days after the operation .
however , if your doctor considers this to be appropriate , also learn how to sp@@ lash away ab@@ se@@ amed herself under the skin .

A@@ cl@@ asta is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ op@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high risk of frac@@ tures ( frac@@ tures ) , including patients who have recently suffered a sli@@ mmer hip frac@@ ture as in case of H@@ inf@@ all ; • Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ tures should be taken before the first inf@@ usion a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedies against infection ) shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta can reduce the symptoms appearing in the three days after inf@@ usion , such as fever , mus@@ cular p@@ ains , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches .
for the treatment of Pag@@ et &apos;s disease , A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
since the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material was used for the evaluation of A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes .
the first study included nearly 8 000 older women with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of hip frac@@ tures and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who had recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta was tested in two studies of 357 patients and compared to a different bis@@ phosph@@ onate for six months .
the main indicator of the efficacy was whether the content of the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in the ser@@ um ( an enzyme that breaks down bone substance ) in the blood returned to norm@@ alized or at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with elderly women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to the patients under plac@@ ebo .
the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % compared to all patients with A@@ cl@@ asta ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment ) .
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ tures , 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ ays occur within the first three days after inf@@ usion and are less frequent with repeated inf@@ usions .
A@@ cl@@ ays may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or other components .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ onate patients , patients with A@@ cl@@ asta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the inf@@ usion site and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( loss of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ asta is providing information for doctors who prescri@@ be A@@ cl@@ asta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission issued Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a permit for the launch of A@@ cl@@ asta in the entire European Union .

oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men an intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes is recommended two or more weeks after surgical treatment of hip frac@@ tures ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et .
after treating the disease Pag@@ et with A@@ cl@@ asta a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et sufficient supply of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or intr@@ am@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes inf@@ usion .
the inci@@ dence of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes can be reduced by using par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after using A@@ cl@@ asta .
patients with kidney function disorder ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended as limited clinical experiences are available for this patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary as the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adol@@ escents A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes are not recommended for use in children and adol@@ escents under 18 years of age , because data about harm@@ lessness and effectiveness are missing .
A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended for patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because only limited clinical experience exists for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with A@@ cl@@ asta before the beginning of treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta by adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone structure , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et sufficient supply of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids , poor oral hygiene , should be considered before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ onate with appropriate preventive dental treatment .
for patients who require dental intervention , no data is available whether the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan for each patient and based on an individual benefits risk assessment .
the inci@@ dence of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes can be reduced by using par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after using A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes ( see section 4.2 ) .
inci@@ dence of adverse side effect reported cases of atri@@ al fi@@ brill@@ ation was increased in patients who received A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes ( 1,3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received plac@@ ebo ( 0,6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , HOR@@ I@@ ZON - recur@@ rent Fr@@ ac@@ ture Trial &#91; RF@@ T &#93; ) the total frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ brill@@ ation between A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug interactions are listed in Table 1 .
ren@@ al dys@@ functions Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ics was associated with kidney function disorders that expressed itself as a decrease in the ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um @-@ cre@@ atine ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure and a restricted ren@@ al function were comparable in a clinical study of oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in the ser@@ um @-@ cre@@ atine within 10 days after administration was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes compared to 0.8 % of the patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
based on the evaluation of the lab findings , the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium values , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation area ( less than 2.10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , were treated in 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et studies .
all patients received supple@@ ment@@ arily sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et trials ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently suffered hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D @-@ levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study , local reactions to the inf@@ usion site , such as red@@ ness , sw@@ elling and / or pain , were reported ( 0.7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses in the or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic area , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( primarily in the jaw area ) , were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ onate , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the majority of reports refers to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental attacks .
7 patients with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients received oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the or@@ tho@@ don@@ tic area in a patient treated with A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes and with plac@@ ebo treated .
in the event of an over@@ dose that leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation can be obtained through the addition of oral calcium and / or an intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was indicated in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 females aged 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density ( BM@@ D ) T @-@ Score for the thig@@ h ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing ver@@ teb@@ ral body structure .
effects on morph@@ ometric fluid body frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes reduced significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new ver@@ teb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes treated patients aged 75 and older had a 60 % reduced risk of ver@@ teb@@ ral frac@@ tures compared to plac@@ ebo @-@ patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effect on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes has a consistent effect over three years , which resulted in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes increased bone density on lum@@ bar ver@@ teb@@ ral , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to plac@@ ebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase of the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6.0 % , the thig@@ h by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology With 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) , one year after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ si@@ es were taken from the pel@@ vic Spine .
in comparison to plac@@ ebo , a micro@@ computer@@ ised ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tr@@ ab@@ ecular bone volume and the preservation of the tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ary bone architecture .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pep@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in the ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in ser@@ um were determined in sub @-@ groups of 517 to 1.@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during the study period .
the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes reduced B@@ SAP by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was reduced significantly by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 125@@ .000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intr@@ am@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before inf@@ usion .
overall mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .
effect on the bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the HOR@@ I@@ ZON @-@ RF@@ T study , A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes treat the BM@@ D on the total hip and thig@@ h as compared to plac@@ ebo treatment at all times .
the A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes treatment performed more than 24 months compared to plac@@ ebo treatment to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.4 % on the total and 4.3 % on the thig@@ h .
clinical efficacy in men In the HOR@@ I@@ ZON @-@ RF@@ T study , 508 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a decrease in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the inci@@ dence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in plac@@ ebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 23@@ 08 ) , the once annual administration of A@@ cl@@ asta was not inferior to the weekly administration of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at on the percentage change in the lum@@ bar ver@@ teb@@ ra BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical efficacy of the treatment with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et of the bone A@@ cl@@ asta was examined in patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , especially light to moderate he@@ bus Pag@@ et of the bone ( mean ser@@ um mirror of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase corresponds to 2.@@ 6@@ fold up to 3 @-@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The efficacy of an inf@@ usion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid compared to the intake of 30 mg of cr@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once daily during 2 months was demonstrated in two six months compar@@ ative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the initial value for A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month main study ( responded to therapy ) were included in a follow @-@ up phase .
from the 143 with A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes and 107 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at , the therapeutic response of 141 patients treated with A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes , compared to 71 of patients treated with cr@@ ed@@ ron@@ at , could be maintained at an average duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after application .
one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes inf@@ usions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data which proved to be a dose @-@ independent .
after that the plasma tor@@ ch increased rapidly to &lt; 10 % of the peak value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum .
rapid bi@@ phase dis@@ appearance from the large cycle with half @-@ value t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ ß 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al Cancer time t ½ γ 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) pres@@ um@@ ably represent the fast res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and the ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kid@@ neys .
in the first 24 hours 39 ± 16 % of the ad@@ ministered dose in the urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue .
the total body clearance is independent of the dose 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the inf@@ usion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease in z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of inf@@ usion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
a reduced clearance of metaboli@@ zed substances by cy@@ to@@ chrome @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ enzyme systems is unlikely since Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not metaboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or even no direct and / or irre@@ versible , nutrient @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of P@@ 450@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ics cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance , and in the 64 examined patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate dys@@ functional disorder up down to a cre@@ atine @-@ clearance up to 35 ml / min does not require the dosage adjustment of the cit@@ ric acid .
because for severe kidney function disorder ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- clearance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data are available , no statements are possible for this population .
acute tox@@ icity The highest non @-@ let@@ ally effective intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and 0,6 mg / kg body weight in rats .
in the case of studies in dogs individual doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C are the 6 times the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , ad@@ ministered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence .
chronic and chronic tox@@ icity In studies with intra@@ ven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al tolerance of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was ad@@ ministered in rats by doses of 0.6 mg / kg as a 15 @-@ minute inf@@ usion in 3 @-@ day intervals , in intervals of 2- 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose , corresponding to the 7 @-@ fold of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure referred to the AU@@ C , corresponds ) , well toler@@ ated .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated exposure to cum@@ ulative exposure levels , which exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure , tox@@ ic@@ ological effects occurred in other organs , including the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract and liver , as well as intra@@ ven@@ ous inj@@ ections .
the most common infection in studies with repeated use was an increasingly primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ aph@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , an inf@@ est@@ ation that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ absorb@@ able effect of the substance .
rats observed a ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ icity in doses of 0.2 mg / kg as outer and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such a skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects or embr@@ yo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal Tox@@ icity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg due to the reduced ser@@ um calcium levels .

Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Pag@@ et &apos;s disease .
decre@@ asing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens formed from andro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradu@@ al loss of bone mass observed in males .
at the Pag@@ et &apos;s Pag@@ et bone structure takes place too fast , and new bone material is constructed un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
A@@ cl@@ asta works by norm@@ alising the bone structure , ensuring normal bone formation and thus gives the bone strength again .
if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , inform your doctor that you are treated with A@@ cl@@ asta .
if you use A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have been taken / used recently , even if it is not prescription drugs .
for your doctor , it is especially important to know if you are taking medicines , known from which it is known to damage the kid@@ neys .
when using A@@ cl@@ asta , along with food and drinks , worry that you take sufficient fluid in accordance with your doctor &apos;s instructions before and after treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , ad@@ ministered by your doctor or nursing staff as inf@@ usion in a v@@ ein .
if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to take the administration of A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
the usual dose is 5 mg , which is ad@@ ministered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as inf@@ usion in a v@@ ein .
since A@@ cl@@ asta is working for a long time , you may need another dose only after a year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium mirror in your blood is not too low in time after inf@@ usion .
with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta can work longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment .
if the administration of A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes was missed , contact your doctor or hospital promptly to arrange a new appointment .
before ending treatment with A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes If you consider the end of treatment with A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes , please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss this with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first inf@@ usion are very common ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but less frequent after the subsequent inf@@ usions .
fever and ch@@ ills , mus@@ cular or joint pain and head@@ ache occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta .
currently it is un@@ clear if A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have received A@@ cl@@ asta .
physical signs because of too low cal@@ ci@@ um@@ - concentration in the blood , such as muscle cr@@ amps or ting@@ ling or num@@ b feeling , especially in the area around the mouth .

persistent sor@@ eness and / or not healing wounds in the mouth or jaw were reported mainly in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ onate because of other diseases .
allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as sw@@ elling in the face , tongue or throat ) , was reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if one of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not listed in this information @-@ information .
if the medicine is not immediately used , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of hip frac@@ tures .
before and after the administration of A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes , patients must be adequ@@ ately treated with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
because of the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone structure , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic progression , hypo@@ kal@@ emia develops , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta .
in addition , it is very advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , according to at least twice a daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the offering of A@@ cl@@ asta .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or intr@@ am@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ er@@ xes .

A@@ comp@@ lia is additionally applied to a diet and exercise to treat adults with a body mass index ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above or • which are over@@ weight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and additionally one or more
in addition , four studies have been conducted to more than 7 000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used compared to a plac@@ ebo as a suppor@@ tive tool for setting smoking .
studies on the setting of the smoking area showed no uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to assess in this field of use .
what risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? the most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia that were observed during studies ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) were nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) and infections of the upper respiratory .
it may not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or be treated with anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants , since it can increase the risk of depression and , among other things , can cause su@@ icide thanks to a small minority of patients .
caution is advisable when applying A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a means of applying HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , tel@@ i@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) .

the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the effectiveness of A@@ comp@@ lia with regard to weight reduction in patients with obes@@ ity or obes@@ e
medicines used in patients who need it for health and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing explanations for patients and doctors ) , and around the ar@@ z
in addition to diet and exercise for treatment of obes@@ ity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or obes@@ e patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which also have one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ pi@@ d@@ mia ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adol@@ escents under 18 years due to the lack of data on efficacy and harm@@ lessness .
La Dep@@ res@@ sive disorders or changes in mood with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported by up to 10 % , su@@ icide thanks to up to 1 % of the patients receiving the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used unless the benefits of treatment in an individual case out@@ weigh the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also in patients who - besides the obes@@ ity - have no apparent risks , can cause depres@@ sive reactions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
relatives or other nearby individuals are to point out that it is necessary to monitor the new occurrence of such symptoms and to immediately obtain medical advice when these symptoms escal@@ ate . l@@ n
• The elderly patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years have not been sufficiently demonstrated .
patients with cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) in less than 6 months were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant . l@@ n

in addition to patients with obes@@ ity , it is possible to examine the patients with obes@@ ity , and in addition to 3,@@ 800 patients in further indications .
the following table ( table 1 ) shows the adverse effects of the adverse effects in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies in patients treated for weight reduction and associated met@@ abolic disorders .
it if the inci@@ dence was statisti@@ cally significant higher than the corresponding plac@@ eb@@ or@@ ate ( for unwanted effects ≥ 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for unwanted effects &lt; 1 % ) . ng In the evaluation of side effects , the following frequency are explained :
very often ( ≥ 10 % ) ; often ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; rare ( ≥ 0,@@ 01 , &lt; 0,1 % ) ; very t l@@ ä
in a case study in which a limited number of persons were ad@@ ministered up to 300 mg , only slight symptoms were observed .
the patients had a BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² and an existing hyper@@ tension and / or dy@@ sli@@ pi@@ d@@ emia .
n Weight reduction after one year amounted to A@@ comp@@ lia 20 mg 6.5 kg , relative to the initial value , compared to 1,6 kg for the plac@@ ebo group ( difference -@@ 4.@@ 9 kg CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.3 ; -@@ 4.4 , p &lt; 0.00@@ 001 ) .
the patients treated with A@@ comp@@ lia 20 mg and 1.2 kg in the plac@@ ebo group ( difference -@@ 3.8 kg ; CI@@ 95 % -@@ 4.4 , -@@ 3.3 ; p &lt; 0.00@@ 001 ) .
after 2 years the difference in total weight reduction was between A@@ comp@@ lia and plac@@ ebo -@@ 4.2 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 % ; -@@ 3.4 , p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) .

the percentage of patients with H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant group and 35 % in the plac@@ ebo group .
the difference in mean weight change between the 20 M@@ g@@ - and the plac@@ ebo group was 3.8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 , -@@ 2.6 p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) . LN
improvement of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients who had taken the rim 20 mg were about 50 % due to direct effects of the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and about 50 % explained by weight reduction . n eim Ar@@ z
2 hours of achieved ste@@ ady @-@ state plasma tor@@ ches were achieved after 13 days ( C@@ MA@@ x = 196 ± 28.@@ 1 ng / ml ; C@@ t@@ rough = 9@@ 1,6 ± 14,@@ 1 ng / ml ; AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 = 29@@ 60 ± 268 n@@ g.@@ h / ml ) .

patients with black skin color can have a reduction of up to 31 % lower C@@ MA@@ x and a 43 % lower AU@@ C as patients of other ethnic populations .
n popul@@ ation@@ sp@@ har@@ mak@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analyses ( age spectrum 18 - 81 years ) is estimated that a 75@@ - year @-@ old male has a 21 % higher C@@ MA@@ x and a 27 % higher AU@@ C than a 40 @-@ year @-@ old
5.3 Pre@@ clinical data for the safety of these adverse adverse effects that were not observed in clinical studies , but which occurred in animals after exposure in the human@@ ist area , were considered possibly relevant for clinical application :
in some , however , not in all cases , the beginning of con@@ vul@@ sions seems to be associated with proced@@ ural stress such as dealing with animals .
if Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the mat@@ ing ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , no unwanted effects were observed on the fertility or cycle of cycles .
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was studied at the rat in doses of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
in a study of rats on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , an exposure with the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and by lac@@ tation did not cause any changes in learning behavior or memory .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be applied alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes drug ) is not indicated .
it can be additionally applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) , which can not be satis@@ factor@@ ily adjusted with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ ph@@ onic acid or ins@@ ulin , the current dose of the sul@@ ph@@ onic acid or ins@@ ulin can be retained with the beginning of the account treatment except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of sul@@ ph@@ onic acid or ins@@ ulin is reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s ins@@ ulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar levels are sin@@ king , allowing type @-@ 2 diabetes to be better adjusted .
in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was studied ; the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with sul@@ ph@@ onic acid , in addition they received either ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tos resulted in lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that blood glu@@ cose levels were lo@@ wered by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg doses .
at the end of the Tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional administration of ac@@ tos for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ ph@@ onic acid in lowering H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values decreased by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional administration of plac@@ ebo resulted in a reduction of 0.35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and ins@@ ulin was studied in 289 patients , the patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to ins@@ ulin declined to decrease H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0,@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who additionally took plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual dys@@ functions , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ ther@@ mic ( decreased sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
Ac@@ tos must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or one of the other constitu@@ ents , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ do@@ sis ( high k@@ et@@ one mirror - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in for patients in which met@@ form@@ is is not indicated .
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited a permit for the marketing of Ac@@ tos across the European Union .

pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ adequate with ins@@ ulin and is un@@ suitable for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
no data is available for the use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , so the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are endangered through the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. former heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the physician should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with ins@@ ulin .
a cardiovascular Out@@ come study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients less than 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in reports on heart failure , which , however , did not lead to an increase in mort@@ ality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver enzymes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on may not be used .
if AL@@ T mirrors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range , the liver enzymes are to be monitored again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that point to a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , over@@ bau@@ ch@@ are , fatigue , loss of appeti@@ te and / or dark urine , the liver enzymes are checked .
the decision whether the treatment of the patient is continued with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on should be directed to the clinical assessment of the laboratory parameters .
in clinical studies with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been demonstrated , which may deri@@ ve from fat deposits and in some cases linked to a fluid retention .
as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a minor reduction of mean ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under the therapy with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on .
similar changes were observed in compar@@ ative controlled studies with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients with met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ es by 3,@@ 6 @-@ 4.1 % ) and a lower degree also in patients with sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ ine and ins@@ ulin ( relative reduction in ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ es by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased ins@@ ulin sensitivity , patients who receive Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on as oral two @-@ way or triple @-@ combination therapy with ins@@ ulin , the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
after the market launch , the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , was reported about a occurrence or wor@@ sen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a reduction of visual acu@@ ity .
it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct link between the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma if patients report ab@@ norm@@ alities of visual acu@@ ity ; an appropriate oph@@ thalm@@ ologic examination should be considered .
in a summar@@ izing analysis of adverse events concerning frac@@ tures from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on
frac@@ ture inci@@ dence was 1.9 Fra@@ ktur for each 100 patient years in the women and 1,1 frac@@ tures treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in women who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of more than 3.5 years investig@@ ating cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures performed at 44 / 870 ( 5,@@ 1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with compar@@ ative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy and if a patient desires a pregnancy or that occurs , the treatment is to be termin@@ ated ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies investig@@ ating the interactions have shown that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on does not exercise any relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ ogen@@ icity of di@@ go@@ x@@ ine , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with drugs that are metaboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ reduction inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase of the AU@@ C from Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction in the AU@@ C from Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that in the treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia resulting in pregnancy is reduced and increased ins@@ ulin resistance of the mother &apos;s tier@@ es dimin@@ ished , thereby reducing the availability of the met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for fet@@ al growth .
very often &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , individual cases : unknown ( not estimated from this data ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the turbine and the fraction of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical studies with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T climb@@ s higher than three times the upper limit of the standard range as well as plac@@ ebo , but more rarely than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ ph@@ onic acid .
in an Out@@ come study in patients with advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease , the inci@@ dence of severe heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was 1.6 % higher than plac@@ ebo when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on res@@ p .
since the market launch , in@@ suffici@@ ency was rarely reported in pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , but more often when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was used in combination with ins@@ ulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summar@@ izing analysis of adverse events concerning frac@@ tures from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with compar@@ ative medi@@ ation .
during the trial period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures performed at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with compar@@ ative medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days , no symptoms occurred .
pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on seems to have an activation of specific nuclear recep@@ tors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( PP@@ AR @-@ γ ) ) which leads to increased ins@@ ulin sensitivity of liver , gre@@ ase and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces glu@@ cos@@ amine production in the liver and improves the peripher@@ al glu@@ cos@@ ever@@ sion in the event of ins@@ ulin resistance .
a clinical trial with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de as mon@@ otherapy has been continued over two years to study the time until after the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years after the beginning of the therapy , a blood cell control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) was maintained by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in 69 % of the patients treated ( compared to 50 % of patients under Gli@@ cl@@ aci@@ d ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was in@@ adequate despite three months of optimization with ins@@ ulin , were random@@ ised to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo .
in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.45 % compared to the patients receiving only ins@@ ulin ; a reduction in ins@@ ulin doses in the group treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was observed .
in clinical studies over a year , under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents was compared to the bas@@ eline values .
the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week examination of type 2 diabe@@ tics .
in most clinical trials compared to plac@@ ebo , a reduction of the total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol as well as slightly , however clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol .
in clinical studies over a period of up to two years , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced overall plas@@ tic@@ l@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de and increased HD@@ L cholesterol .
compared to plac@@ ebo , there was no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel in Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , whereas measured values were observed under met@@ form@@ in and gli@@ cl@@ aci@@ d .
in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced not only the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , both with an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular Out@@ come study , 5@@ 238 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease were random@@ ised in groups over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to already existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular treatment either pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo .
after oral application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is quickly absorbed , whereby the peak concentrations of un@@ modified pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in plasma usually reach 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV corresponds to the efficacy in about three times the efficacy of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , it could be proven that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on exer@@ ts no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ ogen@@ icity of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) or with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( see section 4.5 ) .
according to oral application of radio@@ active mark@@ eted pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the field ( 55 % ) and a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma elimination period of unchanged pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans and the total active met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced ren@@ al function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of the oral clearance of the parent substance resem@@ ble .
tox@@ ic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated administration plasma volume increase with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and re@@ versible ec@@ cent@@ ric cardi@@ ac hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia resulting in the gest@@ ation decreases and increases the availability of the met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased inci@@ dences of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( in male rats ) were induced by the ur@@ inary bladder epithel@@ ium .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons led to an increased frequency of col@@ der por@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white until whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the in@@ scription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AC@@ TOS &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
frac@@ ture inci@@ dence was 1.9 Fra@@ ktur for each 100 patient years in the women and 1,1 frac@@ tures treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in women who were treated with a compar@@ ative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of more than 3.5 years investig@@ ating cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures performed at 44 / 870 ( 5,@@ 1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with compar@@ ative medication .
in a further study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de were investigated .
in clinical studies over one year , under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents was compared to the bas@@ eline values .
in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced not only the in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , both with an effect on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study was the target of its primary end@@ point , which resulted in a combination of total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , cor@@ on@@ ary vas@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation and vas@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that with the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on there are no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white until whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 45 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the wording &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AC@@ TOS &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a summar@@ izing analysis of adverse events concerning frac@@ tures from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients receiving compar@@ ative medication , increased inci@@ dence of frac@@ tures in women .

Ac@@ t@@ aph@@ ane is normally used once or twice a day if a rapid initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .

Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane was evaluated in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pan@@ cre@@ as cannot produce ins@@ ulin , and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use ins@@ ulin effectively .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ t@@ aph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels were lo@@ wered similar to that of another human ins@@ ulin .
Ac@@ t@@ aph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human ins@@ ulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
also , the dos@@ ages of Ac@@ t@@ aph@@ an may be adjusted if it is ad@@ ministered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the treatment plant ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ t@@ aph@@ ane were out@@ weigh@@ ed in the treatment of diabetes against the risks .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the marketing of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ans throughout the European Union .
pre@@ mixed ins@@ ulin products are usually used once or twice a day if a rapid initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose is inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar levels have improved significantly for example by intensi@@ fied ins@@ ulin therapy , can change the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms and should therefore be advised accordingly .
any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturers ) , ins@@ ulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ phas@@ eal , long acting ins@@ ulin , etc . ) , type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin , human ins@@ ulin or ins@@ ulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA toward ins@@ ulin of animal origin ) can cause a change in the dosage .
if a dose is required when switching to Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary for the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic reactions occurred after a change from animal to human ins@@ ulin , reported that the early symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or unlike their previous ins@@ ulin .
before travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to obtain the advice of his doctor as such journeys may cause ins@@ ulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore take into account possible interactions during the therapy and ask his patients to consult other medicines .
4 B@@ oth hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which can occur in a not sufficiently controlled di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fertility in uter@@ o .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias can lead to un@@ consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es and end with temporary or permanent disorders of the brain function and even death .
diseases of the nervous system - Peri@@ ph@@ ere Neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid recovery of the blood cell control can be associated with complaints which are referred to as acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are usually re@@ versible .
5 An intensi@@ fication of ins@@ ulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement of blood sugar can however be associated with a temporary wor@@ sen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic retin@@ opathy .
skin and skin tissue diseases - Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy An the injection site may develop a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy if fo@@ amed to change the incis@@ ions within the injection area .
general conditions and complaints at the site Gel@@ eg@@ nal - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reaction at the injection site Dur@@ ing the ins@@ ulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( red@@ ness , sw@@ elling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma occur at the injection site ) occur .
diseases of the immune system - Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Ex@@ an@@ them Very rare - an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions symptoms of gener@@ alized hyper@@ sensitivity , including gener@@ alized skin r@@ ash , it@@ ching , swe@@ ating , g@@ astro@@ intestinal disorders , angi@@ otic ede@@ ma , breathing difficulties , heart p@@ alp@@ itations , low blood pressure and impot@@ ence / un@@ consciousness .
hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can however be gradually developed : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can be treated by the oral feed of glu@@ cose and sug@@ ary foods .
diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape sugar@@ s , swe@@ ets , bis@@ cu@@ its , or sugar @-@ containing fruit juice . • Heavy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intr@@ am@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a designated aid doctor or by glu@@ cose which is given intra@@ ven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect begins within half an hour , the active maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration is up to 24 hours .
res@@ or@@ ption The absorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of ins@@ ulin products with fast or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of fis@@ sur@@ es ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human ins@@ ulin molecular were considered ; none of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites formed by the cle@@ av@@ age are active .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated use , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , car@@ cin@@ ogenic potential and re@@ productive tox@@ icity , the pre@@ clinical data cannot detect any particular haz@@ ards for humans .
it is recommended - after the Ac@@ t@@ aph@@ one Cut@@ out Bot@@ tle from the fridge is taken - the temperature of ins@@ ulin at room temperature ( not exceeding 25 ° C ) is allowed before it is eaten according to the operating instructions for the first use .

the present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
the medicinal ingredient in Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id , ins@@ ulin , human ( r@@ DNA ) , is produced using the method of the so @-@ called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant technology . &quot;
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 86 68 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ europa@@ .eu © E@@ MEA 2007 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Auth@@ or@@ ised for non commercial purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged How was Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id examined ?
Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to ins@@ ulin humane ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id may also be adjusted if it is ad@@ ministered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the marketing of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id across the European Union .
if two types of ins@@ ulin are mixed , the amount of ins@@ ulin produced quickly must first be put up , then the amount of ins@@ ulin done .
3 If a dose is required when changing to Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary for the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to obtain the advice of his doctor as such journeys may cause ins@@ ulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
5 General disorders and complaints at the site Gel@@ eg@@ nal - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reaction at the injection site Dur@@ ing ins@@ ulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( red@@ ness , sw@@ elling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma occur at the injection site ) occur .
diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape sugar@@ s , swe@@ ets , bis@@ cu@@ its , or sugar @-@ containing fruit juice . • Heavy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intr@@ am@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a designated aid doctor or by glu@@ cose which is given intra@@ ven@@ ously by the doctor .
a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diabe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diabe@@ tic patients , which under@@ went larger surgical procedures , has demonstrated that a mort@@ ality reduced by 42 % ( 8 % compared to 4.6 % ) was reduced by intra@@ ven@@ ously given Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id ( blood sugar 4.4 - 6.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the effect begins within half an hour , the active maximum is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the entire duration of the activity is about 7 to 8 hours .
children and adol@@ escents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 ) and adol@@ escents ( aged between 13 and 17 ) .
the data is limited , however , suggests that the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adol@@ escents is similar to that of adults .
inf@@ usion systems with Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id in concentrations 0.05 I.@@ U. / ml - 1,0 I.@@ U. / ml ins@@ ulin human in inf@@ usion fluid 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de , 5 % D @-@ glu@@ cose and 10 % D@@ - glu@@ cose with 40 m@@ mo@@ l / l pot@@ assi@@ um chlori@@ de are stable when using inf@@ usion bags made of poly@@ propylene at room temperature for 24 hours .
11 If a dose adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id , it may be necessary for the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to obtain the advice of his doctor as such journeys may cause ins@@ ulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .

the intra@@ ven@@ ous application of ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id from pre@@ fabri@@ cated p@@ ens or cartridges should be an exception and only occur in situations where no pier@@ cing pockets are available .
if a dose is required when switching to Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary for the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .

A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who have already signs of crystal deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or bur@@ den@@ some ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. larger urine @-@ crystalline deposits which may lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid levels are still over 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months there are still cases of arthritis , so it is recommended that patients are still taking other medicines at least during the first six months of treatment with A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic .
the medicine is not recommended for children and for patients who had an organ transplan@@ t , as it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study , in which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy of three different A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the plac@@ ebo ( pseu@@ do drug ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study two dos@@ ages of A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg a day .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels were in the blood during the last three measurements below 6 mg / dl .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients receiving A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who once daily received 120 mg , in the last three measurements a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
compared to this , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects of A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , r@@ ash and ab@@ normal liver values .
in particular in patients with heart defects in pre@@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but there could also be a higher risk of side @-@ effects related to the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in diseases that have already led to ur@@ anium deposits ( including one from the medical history known or currently available g@@ out node and / or arthritis ) .
if the ser@@ um ur@@ ic acid levels after 2 @-@ 4 weeks still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , a can increase on A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily can be taken into consideration .
in patients with severe kidney function restriction , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- clearance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
children and adol@@ escents since there are no experiences in children and adol@@ escents , the use of Feb@@ ur@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group .
transplan@@ t Tran@@ splan@@ ters Sin@@ ce there are no experiences with organ transplan@@ t recipients , the use of Feb@@ ur@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or compens@@ ated cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency , the treatment with Feb@@ ur@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other har@@ ns@@ ä@@ ur@@ es@@ enh@@ enden medicines , it can result in acute emergency treatment during the treatment , because the reduction of the ser@@ um har@@ ns@@ mal pi@@ eg@@ els can initially be mobili@@ sed in the tissue .
B. with mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , L@@ esch@@ - Ny@@ han Syn@@ drome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases increases so far that it comes to a storage in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease during phase 3 clinical studies were observed slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function values in patients treated with February ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test prior to the beginning of the February and subsequent treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line Z@@ war has not been carried out ex@@ posi@@ tional studies on Feb@@ ur@@ veda , but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ ing may lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line mirror ( a in@@ hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects , the simultaneous administration of Feb@@ ur@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in February 2008 exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical studies the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in , without requiring a dose adjustment for Feb@@ ur@@ veda or the simultaneously applied other active ingredient .
in a study conducted with prob@@ abilities 120 mg A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily a mean 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of D@@ esi@@ pr@@ amine , a C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of Feb@@ ur@@ ux@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
Ant@@ azi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous use of an ant@@ acid , which contains magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , slow@@ ed the absorption of Feb@@ ur@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a drop in C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C causes .
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregnancy outcomes do not allow any side effects from Feb@@ ur@@ veda to pregnancy or the health of fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , serving machines or performing dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher inci@@ dence of cardiovascular events reported in the Gesamt@@ f@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at@@ gruppe compared to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol group was observed in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of phase 3 ( 1,3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with Feb@@ rau@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors determined in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ clerosis disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensation of heart failure in the medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects , which could occur in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of February and which were reported more than once in all February 2008 treatment groups , are listed below .
di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical studies no serious r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies 906 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 322 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with Feb@@ ur@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the events @-@ related events reported during long @-@ term studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported more than once in all February treatment groups and occurred in patients who received Feb@@ ur@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 m@@ g. in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient @-@ years ) , according to the information occasionally .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 for these cans or with a lower frequency :
diabetes , hyper@@ li@@ pi@@ d@@ emia , in@@ som@@ nia , hyp@@ a@@ esth@@ esia , con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous EC@@ G , cou@@ gh , short@@ ness , skin disc@@ ol@@ oration , skin l@@ esi@@ ons , bur@@ si@@ tis , protein ur@@ ie , ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , erectile dysfunction , increase in concentrations in the blood , decline of the lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te number , decline in the number of white blood cells .
active mechanism of ur@@ ic acid is the final product of the pur@@ in@@ metabolism in humans and arises as part of the reaction cas@@ cade Hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
Feb@@ ur@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is a pot@@ ent , non @-@ purple @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i @-@ value for the in vitro @-@ in@@ hibition lying below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range .
clinical study results The efficacy of A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ik@@ a@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three month specific ser@@ um har@@ ns@@ age levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were .
plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 267 ) , A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) or Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) for patients with a ser@@ um cre@@ atine value to study start of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed a statisti@@ cally significant su@@ peri@@ ority in the treatment with A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statisti@@ cally significant su@@ peri@@ ority in the treatment with A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the conventional dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with ser@@ um cre@@ atine value &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 509 ) received , were summar@@ ized for analysis . * p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus 80 mg
lowering the ser@@ um ur@@ ic acid level to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit in week 2 and sustained throughout the entire treatment .
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um cre@@ atine value &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( d. h .
DEN@@ UR@@ IC was the primary efficacy end@@ point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences regarding the percentage decline of ser@@ um @-@ acid concentrations in subjects , regardless of kidney function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um @-@ acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl about 40 % of the patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a ser@@ um @-@ acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the start of study ( Bas@@ eline ) .
the data gathered in two years of the open extension study of phase 3 showed that the permanent lowering of the ser@@ um ur@@ ic acid level to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 357 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in the inci@@ dence of gyp@@ sum attacks , so that less than 3 % of the patients needed a treatment against a gyp@@ sum ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a gyp@@ sum ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the gland size , which resulted in 54 % of patients a complete dis@@ appearance of the g@@ out no@@ des by month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ Y / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ur@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients receiving Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects increased the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the plasma concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C ) from Feb@@ ur@@ ux@@ ost@@ at after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose @-@ proportional .
for doses of between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for Feb@@ ur@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x is about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µg / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µg / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage decrease in ser@@ um @-@ acid concentration was observed if this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent ste@@ ad@@ low state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of Feb@@ ur@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 litres of doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plas@@ map@@ rot@@ ein bonding of Feb@@ .@@ ux@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary bond to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width , which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es showed that these oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are mainly formed by C@@ YP@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ YP@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , C@@ YP@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ seg@@ ost@@ at@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id arises mainly by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked Feb@@ ur@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose in the urine occurred as un@@ modified February ( 3 % ) , acet@@ yl@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 30 % ) , its well @-@ known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) , as well as other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair found itself as unchanged ver@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , acet@@ yl glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 1 % ) , its well @-@ known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
special patient groups ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency after taking multiple doses of 80 mg A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ MA@@ x of Feb@@ ur@@ ux@@ ost@@ at did not change in proportion to subjects with normal ren@@ al function .
the mean total AU@@ C of Feb@@ ur@@ ux@@ ost@@ at increased about 1.8 times of 7.5 μ ( ⋅ h / ml in the group with normal ren@@ al function to 13.@@ 2 μ ( ⋅ h / ml ) in the group with severe kidney function .

age There were no significant changes in regard to the AU@@ C of Feb@@ ur@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites after taking multiple or@@ ginal doses of A@@ DEN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger patients .
car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , imp@@ air@@ ment of fertility In male rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase of ur@@ inary bladder tum@@ ours ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dos@@ ed group , in about the 11 @-@ fold of exposure in humans .
these findings are seen as a result of a specific Pur@@ in@@ metabolism and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it has been noted that in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fertility and re@@ productive capacity of male and female rats .
at high doses , which were about 4 @-@ fold in human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal tox@@ icity occurred , which went along with a reduction of the Auf@@ zucht@@ rate and a develop@@ mental delay in the descendants of rats .

AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after men@@ op@@ ause , where there is a risk of a low vitamin D mirror .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us , the patient may not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ dat@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D3 are already used separately in drugs approved in the European Union , the Company presented data that origin@@ ate from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to prove the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE regarding the increase in vitamin D sp@@ as@@ el .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels was lower ( 11 % ) compared to those treated with alkal@@ ine ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data that suggests that the Al@@ dat@@ ron@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is exactly the dose that is needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) , and symptoms of the diges@@ tive apparatus , such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , irrit@@ ated abdom@@ en ( bel@@ ted abdom@@ en ) as well as acid elev@@ ations .
AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE must not be used in patients with moderate hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , vitamin D3 or one of the other components .
it must not be used in cases of es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission issued Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd. to introduce AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE to the European Union .
cap@@ s@@ ular , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side .
AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is only available with water ( not having mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
the following indications are to be followed exactly to reduce the risk of es@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed after the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or put the tablet in the mouth , since there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ ine .

the doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible inflammatory responses like dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , pain during swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ al pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn the medicine and seek medical advice ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe ev@@ oph@@ age@@ al side effects appears to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that refer to es@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no increased risk was found , rare ( after market launch ) stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , including some severe and with complications , were reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , usually related to a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ omyel@@ i@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapy regime mainly contains intra@@ ven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ onate .
there are no data available that indicate whether the risk of bis@@ phosph@@ onate therapy in patients who require a max@@ il@@ lo@@ facial surgery reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw .
the clinical assessment of the attending physician is decisive for the treatment plan in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be advised that they should take the tablet next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE after taking notice of failure .
you should not take two tablets on the same day , but take the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on the scheduled day of the week .
other diseases affecting the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ di@@ sm ) should also be treated adequ@@ ately before the start of therapy with AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE .
alkal@@ ine foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines can imp@@ air the absorption of alkal@@ ine when taken at the same time .
therefore patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking al@@ ur@@ ron@@ at before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not performed , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines , without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ VAN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not to be used during pregnancy or breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with al@@ end@@ ron leave no indication of directly dam@@ aging effects in regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients suffering from bis@@ phosph@@ onate , most reports come from cancer patients , but also oste@@ opor@@ osis was reported .

in the two @-@ year leng@@ th@@ ening of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D remained unchanged from the spine and the Tro@@ chan@@ ter ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ oral neck and the entire body was maintained .
it consisted of two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials , where Al@@ dat@@ ron@@ at was taken daily ( 5 m@@ g. daily over 2 years and then 10 m@@ g. daily , either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily administration of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at reduced the occurrence of at least one new ver@@ teb@@ ral frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 7.9 % versus plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .

oste@@ opor@@ osis was effective in oste@@ opor@@ osis when it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy subjects the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ on ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of alkal@@ ine ( increase in average in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies in rats have shown that , after intra@@ ven@@ ous gran@@ ulation of 1 mg / kg , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is temporarily divided into tissue , but then rapidly spread into the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion After intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C al@@ ur@@ ron@@ ate , about 50 % of the radio@@ active ingredient was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the rot@@ ting .
after intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was 71 ml / min and the system@@ ic Clear@@ ance exceeded not 200 ml / min .
in rats , al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the acid or bas@@ al transport system of the kid@@ neys , and therefore it is not assumed that humans have influenced the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs through these transport systems .

advoc@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is ad@@ ministered adult patients who have transplan@@ ted kidney or liver to prevent rejection of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ graf / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously conducted studies with Pro@@ graf / Pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from the published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , whereby the application of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f was compared with Pro@@ graf / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was gra@@ ded after a period of one year ( for example investigated how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or a res@@ ump@@ tion of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , more recent studies have been conducted on 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and studied how Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ graf / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

in patients with moderate hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or one of the other components , Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f may not be used .
patients and doctors need to be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines are taken at the same time with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , as the Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f dosage or the dose of the medication taken at the same time must be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased inci@@ dence of side effects including under@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes in the formulation or regime should only be carried out under the close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of a switch to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains .
the dosage of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood level regulations ( see below &quot; Recomm@@ end@@ ations &quot; )
after conversion from Pro@@ graf to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ king should be checked before switching and over two weeks after conversion .
on Day 4 the system@@ ic exposition , measured as a valley mirror , was comparable with both form@@ ulations in both kidney and liver transplan@@ ts .
careful and repeated checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ king are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate transplan@@ t phase .
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low clearance , an adjustment of the Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f can take several days before Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition in the first post@@ operative phase does not allow oral consumption of medicines , the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment may be in@@ trac@@ ed ( Pro@@ graf 5 mg / ml concentrate to produce an inf@@ usion solution ) with a dose of approx .
the duration of the application for the supp@@ ression of the gra@@ ft rejection must be maintained by the immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be given .

further dose adjustments may be required later as the Phar@@ mac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabili@@ zation of the patient after transplan@@ tation .
dosage recommendations - A liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The oral Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendation - Tran@@ sition from Pro@@ graf to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f M@@ ust a Tran@@ splan@@ t Tran@@ splan@@ t from twice daily dos@@ ages of Pro@@ graf capsules to a once daily intake of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , this conversion has to take place in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , relative to the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation after mig@@ rating from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f once a day , the treatment with the or@@ ally initial dosage recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ tation needs to start the pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ t rep@@ ul@@ sion .
transplan@@ tation In adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is an oral Initi@@ al dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day daily once in the morning .
other Tran@@ splan@@ t recipients , although there are no clinical experience with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f in lung , p@@ ank@@ an and gut transplan@@ ted patients , patients received pro@@ graf in an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0,@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and with intestinal transit recep@@ tors in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
can be adjusted in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function . in patients with severe liver dysfunction , a reduction of the dose may be required in patients with severe liver dysfunction .
patients with reduced ren@@ al function Sin@@ ce the ren@@ al function exer@@ ts no influence on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that dosage adjustment is not required .
however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of ser@@ um cre@@ atine insp@@ iegel , calculation of the cre@@ atine integrity and a monitoring of the urine volume ) is recommended .
conversion from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f In the conversion from one C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ to to a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy caution is advisable ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the level of seb@@ um in full blood The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in the individual case under the aid of full blood Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ king Cont@@ rols .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ king during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ Tal@@ king of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled after conversion from Pro@@ graf to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f , dosage adjustment , changes of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or while applying substances that could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us full blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f is a medicine with a low clearance , adap@@ tations of the dose may require several days until Ste@@ ady State has entered .
the data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the levels in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the blood level of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the whole blood in the first time after liver transplan@@ tation is usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml , and cardi@@ ac transplan@@ ts in 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and cardi@@ ac transplan@@ t recep@@ tors , blood concentrations were usually used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml .
this led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which can occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; changes in the formulation or regime should only be carried out under the close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 In the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be treated as a therapy @-@ proof opposite other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive agents , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ arded formulation of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f .
for pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recep@@ tors and transplan@@ t recep@@ tors in childhood , no clinical data is still present for the ret@@ arded formulation of Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f .
due to possible interactions that may lead to a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements , the Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , is to avoid other plant remedies during treatment with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us concentrations in the blood is offered , as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels can be subjected to considerable fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances .
in rare cases a hyper@@ tro@@ phy called Lyme cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was observed under Pro@@ graf , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , liquid over@@ load and o@@ ede@@ ma .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , the exposure of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes due to suitable clothes or use of a sun protection device with a high protection factor .
if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for PRE@@ S like head@@ aches , altered state of consciousness , cr@@ amps and vision distur@@ ban@@ ces should show a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
since Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f Hart@@ kap@@ seln , ret@@ arded , l@@ act@@ ose contains , special care is required in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ t@@ ary Gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , l@@ act@@ ase deficiency or glu@@ cose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 can influence the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and consequently increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
it is therefore advisable to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels while offering substances that can change the C@@ YP@@ 3A metabolism , and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain constant concentrations according to ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly pronounced reci@@ pro@@ cal effect was made with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ rac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and v@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole and with the Macro@@ id @-@ antibiotic er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood levels mainly resulted from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , caused by the in@@ hibition of g@@ astro@@ intestinal metabolism .
high @-@ dose pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rep@@ ul@@ sion reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other drugs called Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hibition ; therefore , the simultaneous application of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with drugs that are metaboli@@ zed by C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 can affect their metabolism .
as tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us reduce the clearance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills and thus increase hormone exposure , decisions on contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures should be particularly cau@@ tious .
the results of animal tests have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can potentially reduce the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and can pro@@ long their half @-@ value .
the results of a low number of transplan@@ t patients do not indicate that under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in comparison to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in the case of uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially regarding its effect on the kid@@ neys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ k@@ ali@@ emia of the new@@ born ( inci@@ dence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the secondary acting profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive agents is often not determined exactly because of the dise@@ as@@ iness of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .

cases of BK @-@ Virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ Virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ co@@ enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy , including therapy with Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f .
it was reported about ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ m including EB@@ V @-@ associated lymph@@ opro@@ lifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors associated with the treatment of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and the high binding of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ sis .
active mechanisms and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on a molecular level are likely to medi@@ ate the effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us through its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ oli@@ cal protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cellular memory .
this results in a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of sign@@ alling path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ kin genes .
tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us supp@@ resses the activation of the T cells and the prolifer@@ ation of B cells dependent on the T @-@ hel@@ per cells ( like Inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , Inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) and the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 recep@@ tor .

175 patients transplan@@ ted patients with 475 patients who had under@@ gone a pan@@ cre@@ atic transplan@@ t and in 630 cases were used as a primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant .
overall , the safety profile of oral Pro@@ graf in these published studies was consistent with the observations in the large studies in which Pro@@ graf was used in liver , kidney , and cardi@@ ac transplan@@ t recipients into primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
lung transplan@@ tation in intermediate analysis over a recently conducted , multi @-@ cent@@ ric study with oral Pro@@ graf was reported over 110 patients who received either Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in within 1 : 1 random@@ isation .
chronic transplan@@ t rep@@ ul@@ sion , bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ al syndrome , was less common in the first year after the transplan@@ t ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
survival rates after one year were 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .

the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 0.@@ 02 ) was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients that were converted from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) .

in a study , the inci@@ dence of the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis ob@@ liter@@ ated syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
pan@@ cre@@ atic transplan@@ tation A multi @-@ cent@@ ric study with oral Pro@@ graf was performed to 205 patients who received a pan@@ cre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ t at the same time , who received a random@@ ised trial tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral Initi@@ al@@ do@@ sis ( per protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached to reach the desired seb@@ ac@@ eous levels from 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
intestinal Tran@@ splan@@ tation The published clinical results of a mono@@ cent@@ ric study with oral pro@@ graf as the primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive after color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ tation demonstrated a current survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .
methods for early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) - and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ row aug@@ mentation , additional administration of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 antagon@@ ist dac@@ li@@ zumab , lower initial doses of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , which lead to seb@@ ac@@ eous radi@@ ations between 10 and 15 ng / ml and recently transplan@@ t radiation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 234 : 404 ) .
factors such as low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the sin@@ less fraction of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , or a higher clearing of metabolism should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after transplan@@ tation .
this suggests that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is almost completely metaboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion occurs mainly via the bile .
in stable patients who were moved from Pro@@ graf ( twice daily ) to Adv@@ ag@@ ra@@ f ( once daily ) in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) relative to the total dose dose , system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than Pro@@ graf .

advoc@@ ate is used to treat and prevent ble@@ eding in patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( caused by the lack of factor VIII conditional , con@@ genital blood co@@ ag@@ ulation disorder ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application are based on whether advoc@@ ates are used to treat ble@@ eding or preventing ble@@ eding in surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A suffer from a factor VIII defect , causing ble@@ eding problems such as ble@@ eding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but is produced by a method called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot;
it is produced by a cell , into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which it enables the formation of the human scent factor VIII .
advoc@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , similar , but is produced differently , so that the medicine does not contain proteins human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe up to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , including a study involving 53 children under six years , the use of the drug to prevent ble@@ eding and surgical procedures was investigated .
in the main study , the effectiveness of advoc@@ ates in preventing ble@@ eding in 86 % of 510 new hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good &quot; was evaluated .
the most common side effects of advoc@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ ache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII .
advoc@@ ate may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human scent factor VIII , mouse or hamster protein or one of the other ingredients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company B@@ ax@@ ter AG to introduce advoc@@ ates throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dosage The dosage and duration of the substitu@@ tion therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII @-@ deficiency , on the place and the extent of ble@@ eding and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the following ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor VIII activity in the corresponding period does not fall below the given plasma tor@@ ch ( in % of the standard or I.@@ E. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients less than 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute imp@@ air@@ ment are eliminated .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk is over for the patient .
during the course of treatment , the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections are recommended to determine the factor VIII @-@ plasma tor@@ ch .
individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII , achieve different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times .
3 Pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis For long @-@ term pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of ble@@ eding in patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VIII per kg body weight should be given at intervals of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII @-@ plasma activities are not reached or if the ble@@ eding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be performed to detect an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII @-@ therapy is not effective , so other therapeutic measures must be considered .
the rate of administration should follow the patient &apos;s condition whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in treating patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always directed against the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII , directed by Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by means of modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , whereby the risk of the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure levels and an@@ am@@ n@@ estic @-@ known inhibit@@ ors development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the recur@@ rence of ( lower ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women there are no experiences regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , all of which were previously untreated patients with higher risk to the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of individual patients ( 234 ) . the unexpected drop in the VIII @-@ sp@@ eg@@ els blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 post@@ oper@@ atively day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE inf@@ usion .
the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - mirror in the plasma as well as the Clear@@ ance Rate demonstrated sufficient values on the 15th post@@ operative day .

in addition , none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) after prior exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) found an inhibit@@ or .
in previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical study , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) were treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII .
the immune response of patients on traces of contam@@ inated proteins was analyzed by investig@@ ating anti@@ body ti@@ tres against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant up@@ trend as well as a persistent peak of anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indic@@ ative of an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the inci@@ dence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pre@@ ur@@ itus , r@@ ash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ oph@@ ile gran@@ u@@ loc@@ y@@ tes were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study .

based on the data available since the initial approval , CH@@ MP continues to evaluate the benefits risk weighing as positive , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which necess@@ it@@ ates a fil@@ ing of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided to apply for a further extension procedure within 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited has officially distributed CH@@ MP &apos;s Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company with@@ draws its application for approval of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the tissues ( tissues that connects other structures in the body , surro@@ unds and supports ) are affected .
this is a kind of virus that has been gene@@ tically modified to carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ den@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has been modified to produce no copies of itself and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
advoc@@ ate would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable cancer cells to re@@ build the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the non @-@ defective p@@ 53 gene in the human body , usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and killing the cells when DNA cannot be recovered .
in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , where the p@@ 53 @-@ gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company presented data from a study with a patient in which Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer occurred in the field of under@@ mining , bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP had checked the answers from the company to the questions he asked , some questions were still un@@ answered .
based on the review of the initial documents submitted , CH@@ MP will create a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120 .
according to CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently proven that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore brings benefits to patients .
the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company has not sufficiently proven that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is not harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not know CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical studies or &quot; comp@@ assi@@ onate Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; modified drug release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are so combined that one of the effective ingredients will be released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ ina@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( h@@ ay fever , inflammation of the nas@@ al path@@ ways caused by pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cosa ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adol@@ escents aged 12 and over , the recommended dose of aer@@ ina twice daily is a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ated once the symptoms , especially the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cosa ( c@@ logged nose ) , are abbrevi@@ ated .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended , because the effects of the drug can be trac@@ ed to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy measurements were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the h@@ ay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
when considering all h@@ ay fever symptoms in addition to con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , patients who participated in the aer@@ ina@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 46.@@ 0 % , compared to 35.@@ 9 % in patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone .
if only the sw@@ elling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cosa was observed , the patients showed an alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms by 37.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who used Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ ina@@ ze ( observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( cardi@@ ac disease ) , cer@@ yn@@ gi@@ tis ( rest@@ lessness ) , an@@ or@@ ex@@ ia ( loss of appeti@@ te ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , head@@ ache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
in@@ tox@@ ins may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or one of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or lau@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( other medicines for treating allergi@@ es ) .
aer@@ ina@@ ze may not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glau@@ coma ( increased intra@@ ocular pressure ) , cardi@@ ac or vas@@ cular diseases including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ tension caused by the thy@@ ro@@ id ) or have a risk of ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the SP Europe European Commission to transport Aer@@ ina@@ ze across the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water but is swal@@ lowed as a whole ( i.e. without breaking it , cr@@ ush or ch@@ ew it ) .
due to the lack of data on in@@ security and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) , aer@@ ina@@ ze should not be applied to children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued following symptoms of symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the duration of use to 10 days , as long @-@ term application the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can decrease with time .
after a decrease in the sw@@ elling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory passages , the treatment can be continued with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine as mon@@ otherapy .
since Aer@@ ina@@ ze P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine contains , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors or within 2 weeks after the end of such treatment .
this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ ean activity in combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , go@@ ur@@ id , cab@@ inet@@ olin , erg@@ ot@@ amine , di@@ hydro@@ carb@@ az@@ ine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ oline , Nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient group and the data do not suff@@ ice to pron@@ ounce corresponding recommendations for dosage .
the safety and effectiveness of in@@ ina@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction , and the data do not suff@@ ice to pron@@ ounce corresponding recommendations for dosage .
patients must be informed that the treatment in the occurrence of hyper@@ tension or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or of p@@ add@@ ons , heart rhyth@@ ms , nau@@ sea or any other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( such as head@@ ache or a strengthening of the head@@ ache ) must be removed .

aer@@ ina@@ ze is at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines can otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or to reduce it to their extent .
in the context of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or alter@@ ations of the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were observed .
the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and the patients treated with plac@@ ebo , regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone or with alcohol was taken .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was not yet identified so that interactions with other medicines could not be completely excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in@@ hi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 not , and in vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hibited and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is .
the in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ality of the application of aer@@ ina during pregnancy is not assured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies however did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to frequency with the normal population .
since re@@ productive studies do not always be transmitted to humans and on the basis of the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , aer@@ ina@@ ze should not be used during pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases , it may result in a di@@ zz@@ iness that may result in imp@@ air@@ ment of the traffic ti@@ ghtness or the ability to operate machinery .
symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( sed@@ ation , ap@@ nea , reduced mental attention , cy@@ an@@ ose , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ ter@@ ings .
head@@ aches , anxiety , ag@@ grav@@ ated mi@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , breath in@@ suffici@@ ency , heart rhyth@@ ms , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thir@@ st , tran@@ spir@@ ation , nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , pre@@ cor@@ di@@ al pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ inn@@ itus , at@@ ax@@ ia , vision distur@@ ban@@ ces and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony .
a CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dr@@ y@@ ness , pup@@ il @-@ star@@ re and - di@@ lat@@ ation , skin red@@ ness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include in@@ hibition of suspension of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ oph@@ iles as well as in@@ hibition of the expression of the P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin hormone molec@@ ule on endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg did not affect the standard measurement parameters of the fluid flow , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective gl@@ aci@@ dity or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical studies , there was no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo daily at the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can cause other li@@ ke@@ able effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestation of a CN@@ S arous@@ al .
Herceptin has taken 1,@@ 248 patients between 12 and 78 years of seasonal and allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , with 414 patients receiving aer@@ on@@ ary tablets .
in both studies , the hi@@ stam@@ ine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of Aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets with regard to the sw@@ elling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cosa , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of in@@ ina@@ ze tablets showed no significant difference in terms of sex , age or ethnic origin .
in the context of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ ina@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ ina@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the fluid balance of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was reached on day 10 .
within the scope of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multiple dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult subjects , it has been noted that four promot@@ ers Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin were poor@@ ly metaboli@@ zed .
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine after the all@@ round administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was bi@@ ble for exposure to the gift of an Aer@@ ina@@ ze tablet .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and re@@ productive tox@@ icity , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine does not reveal any particular haz@@ ards to humans .
the combination possessed no greater tox@@ icity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the substance pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine .
in re@@ produc@@ tion@@ st@@ ox@@ ic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was not ter@@ at@@ ogenic in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
March 2007 and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application application , the pharmac@@ ovi@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines contribute to alle@@ vi@@ ating the allergic symptoms by preventing hi@@ stam@@ ine , a body &apos;s substance , its effect .
aer@@ ina@@ ze tablets rel@@ ieve symptoms that occur in connection with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( h@@ ay fever ) such as s@@ ne@@ e@@ zes , running or it@@ chy nose and dro@@ w@@ ning or it@@ chy eyes at con@@ current con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .

it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 M@@ g@@ - Ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 m@@ g@@ - and 5 mg melting tablets ( tablets that dis@@ solve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.25 mg once a day , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup respectively .
for children between six and eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adol@@ escents with allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( including four studies in seasonal or r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and two studies in patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
the effectiveness has been measured by determining the change of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the sp@@ ind@@ les , imp@@ air@@ ment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six @-@ week treatment .
further studies have been presented to prove that the body utili@@ zes the sy@@ rup , the solution for inclusion and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harm@@ less .
allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis led when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease in the symptom scores ( symptoms scores ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients who received a plac@@ ebo .
in the two studies in Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease in the symptom scores after six @-@ week treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % was compared to 40 and 33 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , Lor@@ at@@ adin or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit to the SP Europe company to launch A@@ eri@@ us in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see under section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on the effectiveness of the application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in yo@@ ung@@ sters aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the current disease progression and can be termin@@ ated after the symptoms have been removed and res@@ umed when re@@ acting .
in the persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) , the patient may be recommended during the allergy @-@ time a continuous treatment .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine tablets , in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally ad@@ ministered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not ampli@@ fied ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may result in imp@@ air@@ ment of the traffic ti@@ ghtness or the ability to operate machinery .
in clinical studies in various indications including allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and chronic di@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us daily compared to patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the most common adverse events reported more frequently than plac@@ ebo were fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , mouth @-@ dr@@ y@@ ness ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical trial with 5@@ 78 adol@@ escent patients aged 12 to 17 , the most common side effect was head@@ ache , with 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study that was ad@@ ministered up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( n@@ in@@ ety clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes in@@ hibition of suspension of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ oph@@ iles as well as in@@ hibition of the expression of the P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin in endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
as part of a clinical study with multiple doses , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was ad@@ ministered up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg a day ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was ad@@ ministered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c inter@@ v@@ all showed itself .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg did not affect the standard measurement parameters of the fluid flow , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective gl@@ aci@@ dity or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis can alternatively be divided in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis .
an allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as shown on the overall cor@@ es of the questionn@@ aire &apos;s quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively dimin@@ ishes the strain caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis .
chronic di@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria was found on behalf of further forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , regardless of eti@@ ology , is similar in the different forms and can be easily recru@@ ited chron@@ ically .
since hi@@ stam@@ ine replacement is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ular disorders , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is also expected to improve the symptoms in other forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria in other forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic di@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines in Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opath@@ ic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines were excluded from the study .
improvement of the it@@ chin@@ ess by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and vig@@ our , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients were comparable with the general seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis population , 4 % of patients had a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin .
there are no cl@@ ues for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines will not be completely eliminated .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in@@ hi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo not C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hibited and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is .
in a single dose study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie rich breakfast ) were not based on the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
the pre@@ clinical studies carried out with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ ad showed no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding the risk profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and re@@ productive tox@@ icity , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine cannot detect any special haz@@ ards for humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals to alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis in children under 2 years are caused by infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data are available that support a treatment of inf@@ ectious r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis associated with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion from upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical an@@ om@@ ali@@ es , the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and corresponding laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metaboli@@ ze Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and experience a higher level of substance ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children between 2 and 11 years who are fully metaboli@@ zed is identical to that with children who metaboli@@ se normal .
this drug contains su@@ cro@@ se and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with her@@ edi@@ t@@ ary problems of fru@@ c@@ t@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glu@@ cose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or a su@@ cro@@ se is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency of this drug should not take .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally ad@@ ministered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not ampli@@ fied ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall inci@@ dence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 was similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
in clinical studies involving adults and adol@@ escents in various indications including allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and chronic di@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adol@@ escents , at which up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( n@@ in@@ ety clinical dosage ) ad@@ ministered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children between 1 and 11 years of age who were eligible for anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ine therapy received a daily di@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in@@ dose of 1.25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis / chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults can be extr@@ ap@@ ol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses of adults and adol@@ escents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adol@@ escents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin population in a dose of 45 mg a day ( the nine times the clinical dosage ) was applied over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c inter@@ v@@ all showed itself .
in controlled clinical studies , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg a day for adults and adol@@ escents there was no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adol@@ escents in clinical studies did not distur@@ b the psych@@ omot@@ or .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous use of alcohol neither increased alcohol induced loss of imp@@ air@@ ment nor an increase in dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess .
in adults and adol@@ escent patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .
as shown on the overall cor@@ es of the questionn@@ aire &apos;s quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively dimin@@ ish the caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic di@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this limited met@@ abolic phen@@ otype was similar to adults ( 6 % ) and children from 2 to 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with ch@@ ew@@ ing ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multiple @-@ dose study with the si@@ pping of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , which are fully metaboli@@ zed .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x was approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ time of about 120 hours .
there are no cl@@ ues for a clin@@ ically relevant drug addi@@ ction once daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adol@@ escents .
12 In various single dose studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin were compared with pedi@@ at@@ ric patients in the recommended doses , with those of adults who received the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was not yet identified so that interactions with other medicines could not be completely excluded .
A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up is offered in type III bra@@ in@@ washing bottles with a child @-@ safe poly@@ propylene cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies in various indications including allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and chronic idi@@ opath@@ ic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets every day than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , where up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( n@@ in@@ ety clinical dosage ) were applied , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate was well toler@@ ated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G intervals .
as part of a clinical study with multiple doses , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg a day ( the nine @-@ fold the clinical dosage ) was applied for over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval revealed .
in controlled clinical studies , there was no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo daily at the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day .
in a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg did not affect standard measurement parameters of the fluid flow , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective gl@@ aci@@ dity or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .

there is limited experience from clinical studies on the effectiveness of the application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in yo@@ ung@@ sters aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melting tablets is removed without dam@@ aging them .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melting tablets during the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven .
the overall frequency of side effects between the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine Sir@@ ups and the plac@@ ebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile identified in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us processed enam@@ el tablets as a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate to take @-@ in formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin .

a A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg melting tablet once daily put into the mouth to alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms of allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see under section 5.1 ) .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us proved 5 mg of melting tablets as a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of Ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate to take @-@ in formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
as part of a clinical study with multiple doses , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a 30 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg did not affect standard measurement parameters of the fluid flow , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective gl@@ aci@@ dity or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in alle@@ vi@@ ating symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear and red@@ ness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .
in individual dose @-@ crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Mel@@ ting tablets with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate to take @-@ in were the formulation bio@@ equivalent .
the overall analysis of pre@@ clinical and clinical exposure tests for the enam@@ el tablet revealed that this formulation is an unlikely risk for local irrit@@ ations in clinical use .
the safety of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in children between 2 and 11 years is identical to that of children who metaboli@@ se normal .
this drug contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients with her@@ edi@@ t@@ ary problems of fru@@ c@@ t@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glu@@ cose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or a su@@ cro@@ se is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency of this drug should not take .
the overall inci@@ dence of adverse events in children between the ages of 2 and 11 was similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
in inf@@ ants aged 6 to 23 months , the most common side effects were reported more frequently than plac@@ ebo , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ e ( 3.7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2,3 % ) .
in an additional study of 2.5 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine solution , no side effects were observed in patients between 6 and 11 years .
at the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( see under section 5.2 ) were comparable in pedi@@ at@@ ric and adult population .
in controlled clinical studies , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg a day for adults and adol@@ escents there was no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis can alternatively be in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , depending on the duration of symptoms .
as shown on the overall cor@@ es of the questionn@@ aire &apos;s quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively dimin@@ ish the strain caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis .
the spread of this limited met@@ abolic phen@@ otype was similar to adults ( 6 % ) and children from 2 to 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with ch@@ ew@@ ing ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
since A@@ eri@@ us solution for taking the same concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine contains , no bi@@ qui@@ val@@ ence study was required and it is expected that it corresponds to the sy@@ rup and the tablets .
in various individual dose studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin were compared with pedi@@ at@@ ric patients in the recommended doses , with those of adults who received the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.r.l. officially distributed CH@@ MP &apos;s Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company with@@ draws its application for approval of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used to protect against influ@@ enza caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the Inf@@ lu@@ enza A virus .
this is a special kind of vacc@@ ine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic emerg@@ es when a new strain of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from human to human because people have not built immun@@ ity ( no protection ) against it .
after administration of the vacc@@ ine , the immune system det@@ ects the parts of the flu virus contained in the vacc@@ ine and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system will later be able to establish a rapid anti@@ body in contact with a flu virus .
afterwards , the membrane of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which det@@ ects the human body as a body foreign ) , has been dis@@ connected and used as a constitu@@ ent of the vacc@@ ine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was conducted not according to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vacc@@ ine is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
should you take part in a clinical trial and require more information about your treatment , please contact your doctor .
if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also included in the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines to treat adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gen@@ ase is available as a solution for intake , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination has not been studied .
ag@@ in@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked what anti@@ viral medicines the patient has previously taken , and the lik@@ eli@@ hood has assessed the virus to respond to the drug .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of ag@@ gen@@ ase depends on the body weight .
ana@@ gen@@ ase decreases the HIV amount in the blood while taking in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines and keeps them at a low level .
AIDS is not cure , but can post@@ p@@ one damage to the immune system and thereby the development of infections and disorders associated with AIDS .
A@@ gen@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two major studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
it was compared to other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors with 206 adults who formerly occupied Prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ ms with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the percentage of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the modification of the viral load after treatment .
in the studies involving patients who had previously not taken a prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , after 48 weeks in A@@ gen@@ ase , more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml than plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gen@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gen@@ ase also reduced the last virus load , but with the children formerly treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , very few responded to treatment .
in the study with adults who were formerly treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , the phar@@ yn@@ us load increased with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r after 16 @-@ week treatment just as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , A@@ gen@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r came to a stronger drop in the viral load after four weeks as with the patients who continued their former prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of ag@@ glomer@@ ate ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , v@@ om@@ iting , skin r@@ ash and fatigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 in@@ gen@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
ag@@ in@@ ase may not be used in patients , the Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut ( herbal supplement for treating depression ) or medicines that are degra@@ ded as well as greenhouse gases and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV there is a risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , a oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( loss of bone tissue ) or an immune reaction syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of ag@@ glomer@@ ate in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines used to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
gen@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefit of ag@@ glomer@@ ate in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously not taken a prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or has not been proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because only limited information is available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued Gl@@ ax@@ o Group Limited a permit for the transport of greenhouse gases across the European Union .
gen@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) previously treated adults and children aged 4 and over .
usually , A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are to be ad@@ ministered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic p@@ adding of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take @-@ up is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , ana@@ ero@@ bic capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 When A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are used without the intensi@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sters ) , higher doses of ag@@ glomer@@ ate ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be used .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase Capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of ag@@ glomer@@ ate in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children .
ag@@ gen@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the lack of data for harm@@ lessness and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gen@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions to 300 mg twice daily .
the con@@ current use should be done with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , they are contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
v@@ generation must not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and are also sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
plant preparations containing Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r during the intake of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that ana@@ gen@@ esis or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to curing the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with ag@@ in@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of transmitt@@ ing HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , A@@ gen@@ ase Capsules should be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic h@@ epatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have increased risk of serious liver inci@@ dents with potentially fatal course .
for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of h@@ epatitis B or C , please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing h@@ epatitis showed an increased frequency of liver dysfunction under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gen@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other Glu@@ k@@ ok@@ or@@ ti@@ o@@ ids , which are metaboli@@ zed via C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the possible benefit of treatment out@@ weighs system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ idal effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and re@@ pression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the metaboli@@ zation of H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , an simultaneous administration of as@@ gen@@ ase with lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended for the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International standardi@@ zation ratio ) , are available methods for determining the drug concentration .
in patients taking this medicine at the same time , ag@@ gen@@ ase may be less effective because of decreased plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ abolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , however the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r at the same time , the patients should therefore be monitored on the symptoms of op@@ ium , especially if there are still low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the potential risk of tox@@ icity caused by the high propylene gly@@ col@@ o@@ coll of the A@@ gen@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups .
v@@ ase should be set to 5 if a r@@ ash of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported on the inci@@ dence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases to whose therapy medications were needed which are associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ abolic distur@@ ban@@ ces associated with it .
H@@ äm@@ oph@@ il@@ en patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors are reports of an increase in ble@@ eding including spontaneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ or@@ thro@@ sis .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with serious immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections may develop at the time of initi@@ ating an anti @-@ inflammatory or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections that leads to severe clinical conditions or wor@@ sen@@ ing symptoms .
although multi@@ fac@@ torial eth@@ ology is accepted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher Body @-@ Mass Index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width are not allowed at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and are also sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gen@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be combined with medicines whose active substances are mainly metaboli@@ zed via C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects for the increased plasma tor@@ ch .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and a resistance development .
in trying to compens@@ ate the elevated plasma levels through a can increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often adverse effects were observed in the liver .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The ser@@ um levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
when a patient adop@@ ts Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut , the am@@ pren@@ atal level is and , if possible , check the viral load and susp@@ end the Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut .
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required when nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is ad@@ ministered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also van@@ ity below ) .
508 % increased , by contrast , reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was ad@@ ministered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical studies dos@@ ages of 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which prove the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of this treatment regim@@ en .
52 % reduced when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was given in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved with the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with calcium ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is ad@@ ministered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , it is recommended a close monitoring since the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ sis in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , due to the ant@@ acid component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the income of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and ag@@ glomer@@ ation are at least one hour apart ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dosage adjustment is required .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would low .
the effect of ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ ine might lower the ser@@ um concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advisable since Del@@ avi@@ r@@ ine could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
if these drugs are used together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring is to be performed , as precise predic@@ tions of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ ine is difficult .
the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and thus to an increase in side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with a@@ generation , a reduction of the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is advised to at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with ag@@ glomer@@ ate in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , however , the plasma levels of both drugs might be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous use of twice a day 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily resulted in an increase in the C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) compared to the value that was observed once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines which are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , may lead to interactions with A@@ gen@@ ase .
patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions which are associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with v@@ ase .
based on data from other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as as@@ gen@@ ase since it can come to res@@ or@@ ption disorders .
the simultaneous application of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ si@@ va known as enzymes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r may lead to a degra@@ dation of the plasma tor@@ ch of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel recor@@ ders such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fel@@ odi@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , and ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , thereby increasing the activity and tox@@ icity of these drugs .
the con@@ current intake of ana@@ gen@@ ase can significantly increase its plasma concentrations and strengthen with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual dys@@ functions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study where Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day with 50 µg of flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , the Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma tor@@ ch increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol dropped by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ interval between 82 and 89 % ) .
consequently , the simultaneous administration of ag@@ gen@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended together with these glu@@ co@@ cci ti@@ o@@ ids , unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ idal effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 , distinctive elev@@ ations of the plasma tor@@ ch are expected at the same time .
since plasma level increases of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including a r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of these drugs is not recommended with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
a more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations up to stabili@@ zation of mirrors is recommended , as the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased at the same time as am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) .
therefore , am@@ gener@@ ase should not be used together with the or@@ ally taken Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while caution is advisable when using as@@ gen@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution .
data for the simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in plasma levels from Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 to 4 @-@ fold .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is ad@@ ministered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on the symptoms of op@@ ium , especially if low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are ad@@ ministered .
due to the low inci@@ dence of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendations can currently be given , such as the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose should be adjusted when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is ad@@ ministered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
in simultaneous dispens@@ ing of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with ag@@ glomer@@ ation , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or ampli@@ fication of the an@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predic@@ table , therefore alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example D@@ esi@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended during con@@ current administration of as@@ gen@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
this medicine may be used during pregnancy only after careful consideration of the potential benefits for the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk lac@@ ing rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r passes into the mother &apos;s milk .
a re@@ productive study of pregnant rats , which was ad@@ ministered by the ind@@ w@@ elling in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase of 12 body weight during pregnancy .
the further development of descendants including fertility and re@@ productive capacity was not affected by the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mat@@ ernity .
the Imm@@ ort@@ ality of A@@ gen@@ ase was examined in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical studies in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gen@@ ase treatment were slightly up to moderate , occurred early and rarely led to treatment .
in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are in connection with the intake of ag@@ glomer@@ ate or another medicine used at the same time , or if they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
most of the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned side effects origin@@ ate from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not receive 1200 mg of ag@@ gen@@ ase twice daily .
events ( grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as related to the study medi@@ ation , were performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as in the treatment of occurring laboratory changes ( grade 3 to 4 ) .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripher@@ al and fatty tissue fat , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of breasts and dor@@ so@@ cer@@ vi@@ cal fat accumulation .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated individuals who were treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ ine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ n over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( p@@ anc@@ ake ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , patients treated patients under am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) in 241 patients ( 11 % ) in 241 patients with in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) .
skin r@@ ashes were usually slightly pronounced , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ il@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred usually during the second treatment week and disappeared spontan@@ eously within two weeks without the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be canc@@ eled .
cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with serious immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections can be developed at the time of the introduction of an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
with PI previously treated patients who received 600 mg of ag@@ gen@@ ase twice daily along with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) were similar ; an exception were increased of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride and CP@@ K values , which received very often in patients who received a@@ generation together with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary support measures should be initiated .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thus prevents the processing of viral and g@@ ag @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ prot@@ ein@@ ate stages with the result of an un@@ equ@@ alled , non inf@@ ectious viral particles .
the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripher@@ al blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in case of chronic infected cells
the connection between the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dosing regim@@ ens - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treated treatment regim@@ ens with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
in six@@ teen of 434 anti @-@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with 100mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred up to 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ates could be gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of isol@@ ates of 13 of 14 children , in which a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred within 59 , with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors not previously treated patients showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , E@@ 34@@ Q , M@@ 36@@ I , M@@ 46@@ I / L , I@@ 54@@ L / M / T / V , Q@@ 58@@ E , D@@ 60@@ E , I@@ 62@@ V , A@@ 71@@ V , V@@ 77@@ I , V@@ 8@@ 2A / I , I@@ 84@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 93@@ L / M .
in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) in patients with vi@@ rolog@@ ical fail@@ ures over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ e@@ as@@ ex mut@@ ations occurred :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing based analyses gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used for estim@@ ating the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V , or I@@ 50@@ V , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , L@@ 33@@ F , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 62@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / G , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with an increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a reduced probability of a vi@@ rolog@@ ical response .
conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to alter@@ ation by additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for analy@@ sing the results of resistance tests .
based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ off@@ s ( separ@@ ators ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four genetic samples reduced with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r generates certain cross @-@ resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r Resi@@ st@@ enz@@ pf@@ ade , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients , where a Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , gasoline avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
conver@@ sely , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ret@@ ains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ex @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the maintenance of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resi@@ dual mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early termination of a fail@@ ing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits , which may have a det@@ ri@@ mental effect on subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the efficacy of ag@@ gen@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , in which with PI previously treated adults with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ osi@@ dan@@ ger@@ a ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred and six@@ ty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus @-@ sensitivity to ag@@ glomer@@ ate , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the part study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis showed the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the time @-@ read@@ ju@@ sted average change from the initial value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the virus last ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , at a non @-@ sub@@ le@@ thal shaft of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ born gen@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving 288 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were pre@@ treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gen@@ ase solution for taking and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients included a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on these data , the benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; greenhouse gases should be taken into consideration when optim@@ ising therapeutic optimisation with PI . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration , the mean duration ( T@@ max ) to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increased , however , reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was ad@@ ministered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , minimal concentration in Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) influences food intake , although the simultaneous food intake influences the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the seem@@ ing distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg for a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates depending on the total pharmaceutical concentration in Ste@@ ady State over the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or in@@ hi@@ bit C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 or represent a sub@@ strate of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 must be ad@@ ministered with caution when given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of as@@ gen@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily ammon@@ ia exposure , as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is available from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; hence , A@@ gen@@ ase solution and A@@ gen@@ ase Capsules are not ex@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram@@ m@@ asis .
the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also negli@@ gible , therefore the effect of kidney function disorder should be reduced to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these regim@@ ens lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those obtained on healthy subjects after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on ero@@ gen@@ icity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cell@@ ul@@ äre A@@ den@@ oma occurred in male animals with doses to the 2,0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
from the present exposure data to humans , both from clinical studies and from the therapeutic application , however , there was little evidence of the assumption of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ nucle@@ us test in rats and chromos@@ om@@ es ab@@ err@@ ation test in human peripher@@ al lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and proven in clinical routine through measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
in clinical studies , no significant liver tox@@ icity was observed in patients , neither during the administration of agro@@ chemicals nor after the end of treatment .
studies on tox@@ icity in young animals treated from an age of 4 days showed a high mort@@ ality in both the control and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
in a system@@ ic plasma exposition , which was significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure to therapeutic doses in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus formation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which indicate a delayed development .
24 When A@@ gen@@ ase capsules are used without the intensi@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sters ) , higher doses of ag@@ glomer@@ ate ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be used .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase Capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the con@@ current use should be done with caution in patients with low or light liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International standardi@@ zation ratio ) , are available methods for determining the drug concentration .
v@@ ase should be set to 27 if a r@@ ash of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and a resistance development .
508 % increased , by contrast , reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was ad@@ ministered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved with the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with calcium ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is ad@@ ministered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , it is recommended a close monitoring since the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would low .
if these drugs are used together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring is to be performed , as precise predic@@ tions of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ ine is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with a@@ generation , a reduction of the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is advised to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data are available for this .
the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium channel recor@@ ders such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fel@@ odi@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ modi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , and ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and tox@@ icity of these drugs .
in a clinical study where Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day with 50 µg of flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , the Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma tor@@ ch increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol dropped by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ interval between 82 and 89 % ) .
in simultaneous dispens@@ ing of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with ag@@ glomer@@ ation , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or ampli@@ fication of the an@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of the potential benefits for the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the fo@@ etus .
a re@@ productive study of pregnant rats , which was ad@@ ministered by the ind@@ w@@ elling in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase in body weight during pregnancy .
the Imm@@ ort@@ ality of A@@ gen@@ ase was examined in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical studies in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary support measures should be initiated .
the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripher@@ al blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in case of chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.50 µg / ml ) .
conver@@ sely , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ret@@ ains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ex @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the maintenance of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resi@@ dual mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on these data , the benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; greenhouse gases should be taken into consideration when optim@@ ising therapeutic optimisation with PI . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates depending on the total pharmaceutical concentration in Ste@@ ady State over the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss ..
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or in@@ hi@@ bit C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 or represent a sub@@ strate of C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 must be ad@@ ministered with caution when given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
also , the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible ; therefore the effect of kidney function disorder should be reduced to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on ero@@ gen@@ icity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cell@@ ul@@ äre A@@ den@@ oma occurred in male animals , which correspon@@ ded to the 2,0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ el@@ ular aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
however , from the present exposure data to humans , both from clinical studies and from the therapeutic application , there was little evidence of the assumption of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test of rats and chromos@@ om@@ es ab@@ err@@ ation test in human peripher@@ al lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes was not mut@@ ated nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
studies on tox@@ icity in young animals treated from an age of 4 days showed a high mort@@ ality in both the control and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that in young animals the metabolism channels are not fully mature , so am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z . )
A@@ gen@@ ase solution for inclusion is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) previously treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the benefits of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gen@@ ase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gen@@ ase solution for inclusion has not been demonstrated either with patients previously treated with PI . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take @-@ up is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , ana@@ ero@@ bic capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should , once they are able to swal@@ low the capsules , stop taking the solution to intake ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase solution amounts to 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , there is no recommendation for dosage recommendation for the simultaneous use of A@@ gen@@ ase solution for taking and low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to avoid this combination with these patient groups .
although dose adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gen@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene gly@@ col@@ lo@@ col@@ ge@@ hal@@ ts , A@@ gen@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated for inf@@ ants and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
the simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of metabolism of these drugs and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects like heart rhyth@@ ms ( z .
patients should be advised that ana@@ gen@@ esis or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to curing the HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with ag@@ in@@ ase , does not prevent the risk 47 of a transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International standardi@@ zation ratio ) , are available methods for determining the drug concentration .
ag@@ in@@ ase should be reduced if a r@@ ash of system@@ ic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with medi@@ um@@ - 49 dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders .
H@@ äm@@ oph@@ il@@ en patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors are reports of an increase in ble@@ eding including spontaneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ or@@ thro@@ sis .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and a resistance development .
508 % increased , by contrast , reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was ad@@ ministered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the con@@ current intake of ana@@ gen@@ ase can significantly increase its plasma concentrations and lead to side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision im@@ bal@@ ances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
on the basis of the data to 54 other C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is not known . A@@ gen@@ ase solution for intake may not be applied during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the propylene gly@@ col contained in pregnancy ( see section 4.3 ) .
in the milk lac@@ ing rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r passes into the mother &apos;s milk .
a re@@ productive study of pregnant rats , which was ad@@ ministered by the ind@@ w@@ elling in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase of 55 body weight during pregnancy .
the Imm@@ ort@@ ality of A@@ gen@@ ase was examined in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical studies in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are in connection with the intake of ag@@ glomer@@ ate or another medicine used at the same time , or if they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dosing regim@@ ens - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treated treatment regim@@ ens with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
early termination of a fail@@ ing 60 therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits , which may have a det@@ ri@@ mental effect on subsequent treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 62 Based on these data , the benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; greenhouse gases should be taken into consideration when optim@@ ising therapeutic optimisation with PI . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the seem@@ ing distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg for a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large volume volume as well as un@@ ob@@ struc@@ ted penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
the underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
in a system@@ ic plasma exposition , which was significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure to therapeutic doses in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus formation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which indicate a delayed development .

the treatment frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the condition to be treated : • In case of small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma , the cream is six weeks to apply three times a week . • In case of small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma it is during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles , with four weeks break between the treatment cycles , three times a week .
before bed@@ time , the cream is thin @-@ lay@@ ered to the affected areas of skin so that it remains sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed off .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four major studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area each 16 weeks .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or plac@@ ebo had to perform either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator for the efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies involving 505 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses .
• In all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than plac@@ ebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the complete healing rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with plac@@ ebo . • The results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas showed a complete healing rate of 66 % to 80 % in patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group .

the treatment with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream is so long to continue until all visible ward war@@ ts have disappeared in the genital or peripher@@ al area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment procedure described above should be considered if intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if in the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated l@@ esi@@ ons are only incomplete , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
when a dose was om@@ itted , the patient sol@@ ed the cream as soon as he / she noticed it and then continue with the usual treatment plan .
I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od @-@ cream is applied in a thin layer and rub in the puri@@ fied , with co@@ wards @-@ infected skin area until the cream is completely dra@@ ined .
there should be a consideration in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
there should be a consideration in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host reaction .
in other studies where no daily peri@@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was conducted , two cases of severe p@@ hi@@ mo@@ sis and one case observed with one to circum@@ cise leading wire surgery were observed .
in case of an application of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od @-@ cream in higher than the recommended doses , there is increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , even under proper application severe local skin irrit@@ ations were observed , which necess@@ it@@ ated treatment and / or have led to a temporary disability .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the output of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ it@@ ated emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
for the application of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od @-@ cream immediately after treatment with other cut@@ aneous appropri@@ ations for the treatment of external co@@ wards in the genital and peripher@@ al area there are no clinical experiences until now .
limited data may indicate an increased rate of inci@@ dental reduction in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od @-@ Creme has shown a lower efficacy in this patient group with regard to elimin@@ ating the co@@ wards .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips , or the hair attachment was not examined .
local skin reactions are common , but the intensity of these reactions usually decreases during therapy or the reactions form after completion of the treatment with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream .
if it is necessary because of the patient &apos;s complaints or due to the sever@@ ity of the local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made of several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the treatment of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
as there are currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment , other suitable therapy forms should be considered in super@@ fi@@ zi@@ ational bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated B@@ CC@@ s there are no clinical experience , so the use of previously untreated tum@@ ours is not recommended .
data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) a lower probability of response to I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od therapy consists .
I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od has not been studied for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on lip area inside the lip r@@ ots .
there are only very limited data on the use of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses on anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the act@@ ose ker@@ at@@ ose on the lower arms and hands support the effectiveness in this application , therefore such application is not recommended .
local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions usually decrease in the course of therapy at intensity or go back after putting the therapy with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream .
if the local skin reactions are causing great dis@@ comfort to the patient or are very strong , treatment may be exposed for a few days .
from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 active l@@ esi@@ ons showed a lower full cure rate than patients with less than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons .
due to the immun@@ os@@ tim@@ ulating properties , I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .

the most common as prob@@ able or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream related side effects were in these studies a reaction to the application place ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od ) .
the side effects that were given by 252 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies of phase III with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream treated patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis are listed below .
this evaluation of clinical signs provided according to the test plan shows that in these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies with 3 @-@ week treatment with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od @-@ cream often came to local skin reactions including Er@@ y@@ thema ( 30 % ) , exp@@ o ( 30 % ) , ex@@ k@@ ori@@ ation / ab@@ sent / shed ( 23 % ) and o@@ ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the evaluation of clinical signs provided according to the study plan shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od @-@ Creme very often occurred with severe er@@ y@@ themes ( 31 % ) , heavy ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and for severe atro@@ phy and c@@ ement@@ ing ( 19 % ) .
in clinical studies investig@@ ating the application of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was established with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment point or in the surrounding area .
the acci@@ dental unique oral absorption of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od , which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , head@@ ache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , existed in hyp@@ ot@@ onia , which norm@@ alized after oral or intra@@ ven@@ ous fluid .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation the system@@ ic concentrations of the alpha interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies showed that the efficacy in relation to a complete healing of the co@@ wards during an I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od treatment was clearly superior over 16 weeks of a plac@@ ebo treatment .
in 60 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od patients the co@@ wards were completely healed ; this was the case with plac@@ ebo in 20 % of the 105 with plac@@ ebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be reached at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od treated male patients , versus 5 % of 161 with plac@@ ebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od in five @-@ time application per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data presented from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that approximately 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all patients treated clin@@ ically been clin@@ ically healed and this remained for 48 months .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od with three times weekly application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was studied in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyp@@ er @-@ otic , non @-@ hyp@@ er ac@@ - l@@ esi@@ ons within a related 25 c@@ m2 large treatment area on the un@@ seen scal@@ p or on the face .
the two @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical radi@@ otherapy after one or two treatment periods .
the approved indications external co@@ wards , ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ at@@ osis and super@@ fi@@ zi@@ al bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma usually do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials in children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od n = 576 , plac@@ ebo n = 313 ) .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od could not be demonstrated in these studies in the dos@@ ages there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks respectively )
a minimal system@@ ic intake of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis was observed during the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentrations in the ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the application in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 per bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 sach@@ ets ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated obvious half @-@ life time was approximately 10 times higher than the two @-@ hour half @-@ time period after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in a previous study ; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
the data for system@@ ic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od to top@@ ical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin was low in 6 - 12 years and was comparable to that with healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ fi@@ brill@@ ary bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study of der@@ mal tox@@ icity in rats led doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ leen weight ; a study carried out for four months also showed no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice at der@@ mal@@ er administration on three days a week did not indu@@ ce tum@@ ors at the use point .
the mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od has only a low system@@ ic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ ated , a risk for humans is considered to be very low due to system@@ ic exposure .
the tum@@ ors appeared in the group of mice treated with the active free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enz@@ ym@@ atic replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ do@@ sis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not associated with brain or ner@@ ves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and thus accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following non @-@ neurolog@@ ical symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : increased liver , sti@@ ff joints , the movements complic@@ ate , decreased pul@@ mon@@ ary volume , heart and eye diseases .
the treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ t@@ ary met@@ abolic disorders .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ alization devices , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction .

the study mainly investig@@ ates the safety of the drug , but it has also been measured by its effectiveness ( as regards the reduction in G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me sen@@ sed G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal big liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of patients aged over five years ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nau@@ sea , abdominal pain , skin r@@ ash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , ar@@ thr@@ al@@ gia ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in limb@@ s ( in hands and feet ) , heat sensation , fever and reactions at the inf@@ usion site .
very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measuring size of the lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any other constitu@@ ent components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review every year any new information that may be known , and where necessary update this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will monitor patients who receive Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in response to the reactions to the inf@@ usion and the development of antibodies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. to introduce Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me to the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by means of re@@ combin@@ ant DNA @-@ technology using CH@@ O @-@ mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , Eier@@ stock of the Chinese hamster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enz@@ ym@@ atic replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ do@@ sis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be conducted by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ t@@ ary met@@ abolic disorders .
the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient w@@ ears this , increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years of age has not been determined , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may develop inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side @-@ effect occurring during inf@@ usion or at the end of the inf@@ usion day ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the inf@@ usion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment where re@@ vit@@ alisation facilities are immediately available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies .
due to the clinical Phase 3 study , it is expected that nearly all patients are Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
because there is little experience regarding res@@ uming the treatment after a longer break , due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions after an inter@@ ruption of the treatment must be handled carefully .
60 minutes before the beginning of inf@@ usion with medication ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and / or anti @-@ py@@ re@@ tic ) to minimize the potential occurrence of inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions .
in case of mild or moderate inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weigh@@ ed and / or a reduction of the inf@@ usion rate at half of the inf@@ usion rate at which the reaction occurred .
in the event of a single , severe inf@@ usion @-@ related reaction , inf@@ usion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
the inf@@ usion can be res@@ umed with a reduction of the inf@@ usion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 are ( anti@@ hi@@ stam@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids ) as well as a reduction of inf@@ usion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate in which the preceding reaction occurred .
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ aine because there is a potential risk of interference with the intra@@ cellular up@@ take of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since there are no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ yn@@ ge@@ al over breast milk , it is recommended to breast@@ feed during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
the side effects in clinical trials were mainly classified as inf@@ usion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and in 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , observed during the phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older at a treatment time of up to 4 years , are listed in the following table according to the following frequency : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ as@@ m , respir@@ ation and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged 5 years , with predominantly heavy cross @-@ country form and a treatment duration up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version occurred within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment , with a more severe trial version ( average after 26 days versus 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) .
until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature departure from the study ) , no antibodies exist in 13 / 45 patients ( RI@@ P ) As@@ say , including 3 patients , in which it had never come to Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version .
patients with low to low anti@@ body levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in urine , while in patients with high anti@@ body ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG was detected in the urine .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ ginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro , which seemed to not affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in the urine .
the presence of antibodies did not appear related to the inci@@ dence of adverse drug reactions , even if the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for enzyme replacement therapy is one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accum@@ ulating sub@@ strate and preventing a further accumulation of sufficient recovery of enzyme activity .
after intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ om@@ es , most likely via Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recep@@ tors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled phase 3 study in 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change in the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute hearing test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for more 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in comparison to the plac@@ ebo group showed an improvement in the lung function and the in@@ ability shown in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and of 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as out of the following table .
the decrease in percentage FE@@ V that is expected to be expected is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the body size of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a h@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly prior to treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks , a clear waste of the G@@ AG mirror was found in the urine ( µg / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) , which remained constant until the end of the study .
in terms of the hetero@@ gen@@ eous manifestation of the patient , which was taken into account by using a combined end point , clin@@ ically significant changes encomp@@ ass@@ ed for five efficacy variable ( anticipated percentage normal FE@@ V , distance in 6 @-@ minute hearing , range of motion of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acu@@ ity ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a wor@@ sen@@ ing in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study less than 5 years ( 16 patients with severe form of failure and 4 with the mean reference form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ ag@@ - levels in the urine in week 22 .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined according to the Z @-@ Score for this age group The younger patients with severe failure form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean cross @-@ country form showed a normal mental development rate , whereas in the older patients with severe failure @-@ form only limited or no advances in cognitive performance were detected .
in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing regim@@ ens were performed on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute hearing test .
100 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosing schedule of 200 E / kg intra@@ ven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a justi@@ fiable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly inf@@ usions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing regim@@ ens is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available , evaluate annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to that in older and less strongly affected patients .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in one @-@ time administration , tox@@ icity in repeated use and re@@ productive tox@@ icity , the pre@@ clinical data cannot detect any particular haz@@ ards for humans .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with cis@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant ) lung cancer that does not attack the cell epithel@@ ial cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used for patients who have not been treated before , in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ o@@ therapies than any therapy .
in order to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
when A@@ lim@@ ta is ad@@ ministered together with cis@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the cis@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti @-@ drug &quot; ( drug against v@@ om@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a liquid deficiency ) should be given before or after the cis@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients whose blood pattern changes or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be post@@ pon@@ ed , decreased or the dose should be decreased .
the active form of tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed thus slow@@ s down the formation of the DNA and RNA and prevents the cells to divide .
the transformation of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed into its active form goes more easily in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer duration in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ural oth@@ eli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metast@@ atic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and cis@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the all@@ round administration of cis@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who previously had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time of A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.3 months , compared to 7.9 months in doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
however , in both studies patients , in which the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epithel@@ ial cells , in the administration of A@@ lim@@ esc@@ ein extended longer survival times than with the compar@@ ative drug .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. to transfer A@@ lim@@ ta to the European Union .
each pier@@ cing bottle must be dissolved in 4.@@ 2 ml 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dosing is removed and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see 6.6 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metast@@ atic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
ALI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - , advanced or metast@@ atic non @-@ small cell car@@ cin@@ oma except for ocular epi@@ th@@ eli@@ ac hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) ad@@ ministered as intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as inf@@ usion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after gradu@@ ation of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - inf@@ usion on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma following previous chemotherapy the recommended dose of ALI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is ad@@ ministered as intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in order to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ id must be given the day before and on the day of the met@@ ro@@ met@@ ed @-@ gift and on the day after the treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last dose of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients also have to receive an intr@@ am@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week prior to the first tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed dose as well as after each third treatment cycle .
in patients receiving tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , a complete blood pattern should be created before each administration , including a differentiation of the leu@@ k@@ oc@@ y@@ tes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te @-@ counting .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ame trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Al@@ an@@ in @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place in the awareness of the N@@ adi@@ r of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the preceding treatment cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are applicable for ALI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria comply with the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC grade 2 ble@@ eding .
should patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the therapy with ALI@@ M@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient has the value prior to treatment
the treatment with ALI@@ M@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if in patients after 2 dose @-@ reduction , ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity level 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - on the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical studies have no indication that in patients aged 65 years or above , there is an increased side @-@ risk @-@ risk compared to patients at age 65 .
ALI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data about safety and efficacy .
in clinical studies in patients with a cre@@ atine @-@ clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min no dose adjustments were required , which go beyond the dose adjustments recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper bili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - Inter@@ medi@@ ate and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit ( in case of absence of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 times of the upper limit ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies .
patients need to be monitored with regard to bone mar@@ row immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression and P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must not be ad@@ ministered to patients before their absolute neutr@@ ality rate has reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ cy@@ te number has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of the absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , plat@@ el@@ ets and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , as observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ ch@@ th@@ a@@ mat@@ ological tox@@ icity including neut@@ rop@@ enia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neut@@ rop@@ enia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ enia was observed when a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 took place .
therefore all patients treated with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed need to be reli@@ ant on fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure to reduce the treatment @-@ related tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous use of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tika ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ anic acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days prior to the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients for whom a therapy is provided with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must avoid the intake of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ time period for at least 5 days prior to the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , hyper@@ tension or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ ac@@ ular space , drainage of the eff@@ usion in front of the P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed treatment should be considered .
5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events were occasionally reported in clinical studies with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , if this drug was usually ad@@ ministered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated life vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of irre@@ versible fo@@ aming of re@@ productive capacity by means of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , men should be advised prior to the treatment tin to obtain advice regarding sperm conservation .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tika ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ icy@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) lead to a reduced P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of increased inci@@ dence of side effects .
therefore caution is advisable if in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ atine @-@ clearance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ icy@@ lic acid can be applied in high dosage .
( i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ icy@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to treatment , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed should be avoided ( see section 4.4 ) .
since there are no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ value such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the con@@ current application must be avoided with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed for at least 5 days prior to the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed .
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased surveillance frequency of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed in pregnant women , but as in case of an@@ de@@ - ren an@@ timet@@ ab@@ ol@@ ite severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy .
P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must not be used during pregnancy except if necessarily - requirement and after careful consideration of the use for the mother and the risk for the fo@@ etus ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of irre@@ versible damage to the re@@ productive capacity is due to the P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , men should be advised before the treatment begins to seek advice regarding the locking service .
it is not known whether P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed passes into the mother &apos;s milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby can not be excluded .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma and the random@@ ised cis@@ pl@@ atin and tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed were as well as 163 patients with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma who random@@ ized cis@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

the clin@@ ically relevant laboratory tox@@ icity of grade 3 and 4 was similar to the summar@@ ised results of three different met@@ ro@@ met@@ ed mono@@ therapies ( n = 164 ) of phase 2 similar to the phase 3 P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed mono@@ therap@@ i@@ est@@ u@@ die , except neut@@ rop@@ enia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in the Al@@ an@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to result in differences in the patient population , since the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies include both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and significantly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or ab@@ normal initial values of liver function tests .

ALI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ) is a ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate that exercises its effect by inter@@ rup@@ ting wei@@ ght@@ - fol@@ ly @-@ dependent met@@ abolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed acts as an anti@@ fol@@ ate with several targets by blocking the thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ lat@@ yn@@ th@@ ase ( DH@@ FR ) and gly@@ cin@@ amide ri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ ide @-@ my@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase ( GAR@@ FT ) , which are fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzymes in the de nov@@ o bi@@ os@@ yn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ - and pur@@ in@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .
EM@@ PH@@ AC@@ IS , a multi @-@ cent@@ ric , random@@ ised , simple @-@ blind phase 3 study of ALI@@ M@@ TA plus cis@@ pl@@ atin on cis@@ pl@@ atin in chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ven patients with mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ural am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma showed that with ALI@@ M@@ TA and cis@@ pl@@ atin , patients treated a clin@@ ically significant advantage of a medi@@ an 2.8 @-@ month survival compared to those patients with cis@@ pl@@ atin .
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients receiving investig@@ ational medi@@ ation in the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma was shown in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / cis@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the all@@ round cis@@ pl@@ um arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms were improved by improving lung function parameters in the ALI@@ M@@ TA / cis@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deteri@@ oration of lung function over time in the control arm .
a multi @-@ cent@@ ric , random@@ ised , open phase III study with ALI@@ M@@ TA versus doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metast@@ atic N@@ SC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy won a medi@@ an survival time of 8.3 months in patients treated with ALI@@ M@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat Pop@@ ulation n = 283 ) and of 7.9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the overall survival in patients with N@@ SC@@ LC was observed in patients with N@@ SC@@ LC ( n = 399 , 9,@@ 3 versus 8.0 months , adjusted HR = 0.@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 0,@@ 61 @-@ 1,00 , p = 0.0@@ 47 ) , in patients with cell squ@@ am@@ ous cell car@@ cin@@ oma ( n = 172 , 6,@@ 2 versus 7.4 months , adjusted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0,@@ 018 ) .
limited data of a random@@ ized , controlled Phase 3 study showed that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for met@@ ro@@ met@@ ed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre@@ treatment with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el are similar .
the efficacy analyses of P@@ Q Pop@@ ulation are consistent with IT@@ T population analyses and support the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of ALI@@ M@@ TA Cis@@ pl@@ atin combination opposite gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine cis@@ pl@@ atin combination .
mean P@@ FS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine cis@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0,@@ 94 - 1,15 ) , the overall response rate was 30.@@ 6 % ( 95 % CI = 27,@@ 3 - 33,@@ 9 ) for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine cis@@ pl@@ atin .
the analysis of the influence of N@@ SC@@ LC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences according to hist@@ ology , see table below .
CI = interval interval ; IT@@ T = Int@@ ent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = Size of the overall population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority , with a total con@@ dens@@ ation interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) clearly below the non @-@ Unter@@ le@@ gen@@ heits@@ bew@@ t of 1,@@ 17@@ 645 ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 001 ) .
patients treated with ALI@@ M@@ TA and cis@@ pl@@ atin required fewer trans@@ f@@ usions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) , er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te trans@@ f@@ usions ( 16.@@ 1 % versus 27.@@ 3 % , p &lt; 0.00@@ 1 ) and thro@@ cy@@ te trans@@ usions ( 1,8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 002 ) .
in addition , the patients needed the administration of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin / Dar@@ b@@ op@@ o@@ e@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.00@@ 001 ) , G @-@ C@@ SF / GM @-@ C@@ SF ( 3.1 % versus 6.1 % , p = 0.00@@ 4 ) , and iron preparations ( 4.3 % versus 7.0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed as a mono@@ therap@@ ist were examined in 426 cancer patients with different solid tum@@ ours in doses of 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in inf@@ usion zones over a period of 10 minutes .

ALI@@ M@@ TA is used for patients who have not received prior chemotherapy used to treat mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ural oth@@ eli@@ oma ( mal@@ ign@@ ant disease ) in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin , another medicine for the treatment of canc@@ ers .
if you have kidney suffer@@ ers or earlier , please discuss this with your doctor or hospital pharmac@@ ist , since you may not be eligible for ALI@@ M@@ TA .
you will be carried out before any inf@@ usion of blood tests ; it checks whether your kidney or liver function is sufficient and whether you have sufficient blood cells to get ALI@@ M@@ TA to 49 .
your doctor will possibly change the dose or break the treatment if it requires your general condition and if your blood values are too low .
if you also receive cis@@ pl@@ atin , your doctor will ensure that your body contains sufficient water and you will receive the necessary medicines to prevent v@@ om@@ iting before and after the cis@@ pl@@ atin gift .

the resulting solution is clear and the col@@ oring ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish yellow , without imp@@ air quality .
it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with low cal@@ orie , low @-@ fat diet .
patients who take All@@ i and after 12 weeks do not have weight loss should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot aboli@@ sh some fats in the food , thereby causing about a quarter of the fats absorbed by the food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines .
in a third study All@@ i was compared with a BM@@ I with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with plac@@ ebo in a third study .
in the two studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who participated All@@ i 60 mg have recorded an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after one year , compared to 2,3 kg when taking plac@@ ebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no loss of weight could be observed for patients .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots at the anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stu@@ d @-@ passage , stu@@ h@@ ld@@ l , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , finish o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( cases ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it must not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may not be used in patients who suffer from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which not enough nutrients from the diges@@ tive tract ) or at chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) suffer , and in pregnant or breast@@ feeding mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission issued Gl@@ ax@@ o Group Limited a permit for the transport of Or@@ list@@ at G@@ SK across the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with over@@ weight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in combination with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ or@@ ical , low @-@ fat diet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all@@ i must not be used by children and young people under 18 , as there is insufficient data for efficacy and safety . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , since or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ized , in older and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary .

the probability of occurrence g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase when all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ fat individual meal or fet@@ al diet .
since the weight reduction in diabetes is associated with improved met@@ abolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before beginning a therapy with all@@ i , because the dosage of anti@@ diabe@@ tic needs to be adjusted if necessary .
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist whether the dosage needs to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnant measures to prevent the failure of oral contrac@@ eption possible in the event of severe di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
in a study on drug interactions and in several cases with con@@ current use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a reduction of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma tor@@ ch was observed .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( international norm@@ alized ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients treated in clinical studies up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as the beta car@@ ot@@ ene were in the normal range .
however , the patient should be recommended to take an additional mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin absorption ( see Section 4.4 ) .
after the gift of a single mal@@ do@@ sis , A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who simultaneously received or@@ list@@ at , a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on plasma concentration .
experimental studies did not show any direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly g@@ astro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the medicine , as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented .
the g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
the frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) and very rare ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) .
the inci@@ dence of known side effects noted after the market launch of Or@@ list@@ at is not known as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of un@@ certain size .
† It is plau@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i can lead to def@@ enses with regard to possible or actual g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects .
individual doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were ad@@ ministered over a period of 15 days to normal and over@@ weight subjects without significant clinical findings .
majority of the reported cases of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose were reported in the majority of cases reported after the market launch , either side effects or similar side effects such as the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on investigations on humans and animals , a rapid re@@ formation of several system@@ ic effects caused by the inhibit@@ ing properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect stri@@ ves in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine through co@@ valent bonding to the active ser@@ in @-@ rest of the ga@@ stro and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic lip@@ ases .
from clinical studies , 60 mg or@@ list@@ at was taken three times a day , the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat was blocked .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 confirm the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at that was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ny , low @-@ fat diet .
the primary parameters , the change of body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , has been assessed as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a percentage of those students who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their base weight ( Table 2 ) .
although in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in the Gesamt@@ chol@@ est@@ erin amounted to 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5,20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL Chol@@ ester@@ ins was 60 mg -@@ 3,5 % ( initial value 3,30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( initial value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
for wa@@ ist circum@@ ference the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3,@@ 7 cm ) and with plac@@ ebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( starting value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of not metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in the plasma could be found spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without any signs of accumulation .
in a study with obes@@ e patients , given the minimal system@@ ic absorb@@ able dose , two main met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ si@@ erter Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after separation of the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , could be identified , representing approximately 42 % of total plas@@ ma@@ concentration .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , car@@ cin@@ ogenic potential and re@@ productive tox@@ icity , the pre@@ clinical data cannot be recognized as a haz@@ ard to humans .

energy is also measured in kilo@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find on food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should consume maximum per day .
follow the tables below in this section . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal .
which amount is appropriate for you , refer to the below information that indicates the number of calories that are suitable for you . • Due to the mode of operation of the capsule , adher@@ ence to recommended fat intake is crucial .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat .
compliance with recommended fat intake allows you to maxim@@ ize weight loss and at the same time reduce the lik@@ eli@@ hood of nutrition @-@ related accompanying symptoms . • You should try to decrease progres@@ sively and continuously .
34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to lose weight gradually and continuously about 0.5 kg per week , without developing fru@@ str@@ ations and dis@@ appointments .
the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake .
• For permanent weight loss , it is necessary to set realistic cal@@ orie and fat goals and to keep them in . • Sinn@@ ai is a nutritional journal containing information about cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • Tr@@ y to move more before you start taking all@@ i .

the efficacy of al@@ al@@ xi can be increased by the additional administration of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ ic agent ) .
the use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended , since the effects in this age group do not have enough information .

al@@ al@@ xi is indicated : for the prevention of acute nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting in strongly v@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer and for prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting in moderate @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the efficacy of al@@ al@@ xi for the prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy may be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ ids given before chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on massage , patients with am@@ ne@@ sty ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute hed@@ gehog should be closely monitored after injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advisable with simultaneous dispens@@ ing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ t interval is extended or which tend to such an extension .
in addition to another chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tical gift , al@@ xi shall not be used for prevention or treatment of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting in the days after chemotherapy .
in pre@@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in@@ hibited the activity of the five chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics directed against tum@@ ours ( cis@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ in , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
a clinical study showed no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interactions between a unique intra@@ ven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ e- concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ ami@@ ds , a C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , the simultaneous administration of C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) and C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , C@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , Chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , Ch@@ ini@@ din , Ran@@ iti@@ dine , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ aline and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience in the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies is not present , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used during pregnancy , unless it is considered necessary by the attending physician .
in clinical studies , the most common adverse events were reported in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least possibly were related to Alo@@ xi , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the place of performance ( burning , har@@ dening , dis@@ comfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experiences .
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequency of adverse events such as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relations to observe .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out , however , due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis is pres@@ um@@ ably not effective therapy with an alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dosage .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1.@@ 132 patients receiving an exc@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mcg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mcg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 were given in day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one intra@@ ven@@ ously .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients who received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ azine and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given day 1 intra@@ ven@@ ously .
results of studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical studies for indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including Q@@ t@@ c inter@@ v@@ alls with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
following the findings of pre @-@ clinical examinations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation and extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy subjects was the assessment of the EC@@ G effect of retired pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in individual doses of 0.25 , 0.75 and 2,@@ 25 mg .
absorption After an intra@@ ven@@ ous gift a slow elimination of the plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination of the body with an average terminal half @-@ value of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally propor@@ tionally in the entire dose range of 0.@@ -@@ 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
after intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.25 mg each second day for a total of 3 cans , the mean mean ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 .
from pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations , the total tex@@ tual position ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) reached once daily intra@@ ven@@ ous dosage ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) was comparable to that of 0.75 mg measured after one @-@ time intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of 0.75 mg ; however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the addition of 0.75 mg .
approximately 40 % are eliminated by the kid@@ neys and some 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , which in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recep@@ tor .
in @-@ vitro studies for metabolism demonstrated that C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in lesser degree , the is@@ tive enzymes C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ YP@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intra@@ ven@@ ous single dose of 10 mcg / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ modified active ingredient made approximately 40 % of the given dose .
the total body of 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min came after a unique intra@@ ven@@ ous lens projection .
although in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the terminal Eli@@ min@@ ation alb@@ umen and the average system@@ ic exposure increase with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , however , a reduction in the dose is however not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were only observed in ex@@ positions which are considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing low relevance for clinical use .
10 out of pre@@ clinical studies suggest that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ari@@ zation and extend the action potential .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose met in approximately the 30 @-@ fold of the therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , resulted in an increased frequency of liver tum@@ ours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ ro@@ id gland , p@@ itu@@ itary , pan@@ cre@@ as , adren@@ al mark ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high doses and since Alo@@ xi is determined in humans for one @-@ time application , the relevance of these results is considered low for humans .

June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report , recomm@@ ending the announcement of the approval of the regulatory approval for the treatment of h@@ epatitis C by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml inj@@ ections solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that al@@ ph@@ is should resem@@ ble a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference drug &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) h@@ epatitis C ( a liver disease caused by a virus infection ) .
in the case of a micro@@ scop@@ ic investigation , the liver tissue has damages , moreover , the values of the liver enzymes al@@ an@@ in- am@@ amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are elevated in the blood standard .
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimul@@ ates it to the formation of the substance .
the Al@@ ph@@ eon supplier presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active ingredient structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of operation , safety and efficacy in h@@ epatitis C ) .
in the study of h@@ epatitis C patients the efficacy of al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 455 patients .
the study was measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment responded to the treatment ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Auth@@ or@@ ised for non commercial purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged What were the greatest concerns that gave CH@@ MP to the recommendation to fail the marketing authorization ?
in addition , concerns were noted that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be mark@@ eted does not suff@@ ice .
the number of h@@ epatitis C patients responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical study .
after setting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease fl@@ amed again in more patients than with the reference drug ; Al@@ ph@@ eon also had more side effects .
apart from this , the test used in the study investig@@ ates the question of how far the drug is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) is not adequ@@ ately vali@@ dated .
it can be used for the treatment of im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected la@@ ths ( cr@@ acks or cuts ) , abra@@ sions and sew@@ n wounds .
al@@ tar@@ go is not to be used to treat infections which have been proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Al@@ ar@@ go might not work against these kinds of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 , the skin surface to be treated may not be more than 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ om@@ es ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and thereby in@@ hi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of the efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was concluded after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients with Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients with plac@@ ebo responded to treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin wounds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : if the results of both studies were taken together at skin wounds , about 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to treatment .
however , in these two studies , however , Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( iron @-@ filled hollow spaces in the body tissue ) or from infections which have been proven or pres@@ um@@ ably caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the job .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go out@@ weigh the risks associated with the following super@@ ficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small hospitals , abra@@ sions or sew@@ ed wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission issued Gl@@ ax@@ o Group Ltd. approval for the placing of Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union .
patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the event of sensi@@ ti@@ zation or severe local irrit@@ ation caused by the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment , the treatment is ab@@ orted , the o@@ int@@ ment should be carefully wi@@ ped and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection began .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be used to treat infections , where MR@@ SA is known as path@@ ogen or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in secondary un@@ infected wounds , the efficacy of retin@@ opathy was insufficient in patients with infections caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
an alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected position occurs .
the effect of con@@ current use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means on the same skin area has not been investigated and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations that were achieved in humans after top@@ ical application on s@@ wollen skin or infected surface wounds , clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not to be expected ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After an simultaneous offering of 2 times daily 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after top@@ ical application of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment increased by 81 % on the skin of healthy adult men .
due to the low system@@ ic exposure to top@@ ical application in patients , dose adjustments are not considered necessary if top@@ ical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during system@@ ic treatment with C@@ YP@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown re@@ productive tox@@ icity after oral consumption and are in@@ adequate regarding a statement on the birth and the f@@ ec@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy when a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of a system@@ ic antibiotic .
when deciding whether breast@@ feeding should continue / termin@@ ate or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continued / termin@@ ated , the benefit of breast@@ feeding for inf@@ ants and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for women is to be considered .
in clinical trials involving 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections that have applied Al@@ tar@@ go , the most commonly reported inci@@ dence of irrit@@ ation was at the place of adoption which considered approximately 1 % of patients .
mode Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deri@@ v@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance , which is isolated through fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the active mechanism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding point of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ om , which distingu@@ ishes itself from the binding posts of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data point out that the Bin@@ dungs@@ stelle ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L3 is involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ Bin@@ ding Unit and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase centre .
by binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line in@@ hi@@ bits the pep@@ tide transfer , block partial P @-@ binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
should , due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance , the use of retin@@ opathy in at least some infection forms appears question@@ able , an expert advice should be consul@@ ted by experts .
there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of retin@@ opathy opposite S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of failure to respond to the treatment with S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of stra@@ ins with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily under oc@@ cl@@ usion on intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days .
of 516 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for top@@ ical treatment of secondary traum@@ atic wounds , individual plasma bow@@ ls were obtained .
the sampling took place on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medi@@ ation and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last use .
however , the maximum individual system@@ ic intake on humans after top@@ ical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 was reduced to 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng · h / ml ) 660 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP inhibit@@ ing .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ YP@@ 2@@ C8 and C@@ YP@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies of oral tox@@ icity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were performed over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ ro@@ id changes .
in vitro investigation on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in mouse lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripher@@ al blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes and in rats micro @-@ core test for in @-@ vi@@ vo analysis of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , resulting in a up to 5 times higher exposure was achieved as the highest estimated exposure in humans ( top@@ ical application on 200 c@@ m2 scre@@ ened skin :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity study on rats were detected in oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 @-@ fold of estimated human exposure ( see above ) , development tox@@ icity ( decreased body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed Os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal tox@@ icity .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect h@@ epatitis A and h@@ epatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 , which are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , with a protection against h@@ epatitis B possibly only after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of h@@ epatitis B infection during the immun@@ isation and is ensured that the vacc@@ ination that consists of two doses can be led to an end .
if a review of h@@ epatitis A or B is desired , am@@ bition or other h@@ epatitis A or B vacc@@ ine may be given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; vacc@@ ines seem to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teach &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it can fight against a disease . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a child has received the vacc@@ ine , the immune system det@@ ects viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and generates antibodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients as the vacc@@ ine licensed for Twin@@ rix adults since 1996 and has been approved vacc@@ ine Twin@@ rix Children since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are ad@@ ministered as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as evidence of the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the share of vacc@@ inated children , who had developed a protective anti@@ body concentration a month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 208 children , the efficacy of the vacc@@ ine was compared to six months and a 12 month distance between the two inj@@ ections .
in between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ rix took a month after the final injection to develop protective antibodies against h@@ epatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar to six and a 12 @-@ month distance between inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ine doses ) are head@@ ache , lack of appeti@@ te , pain at the injection point , red@@ ness , mat@@ ness ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other constitu@@ ents or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission issued Gl@@ ax@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Biolog@@ icals , a permit for placing Ambi@@ rix in its enti@@ re@@ ty .
the standardis@@ ation plan for the pri@@ me@@ val pol@@ ari@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix comprises two vacc@@ inations , whereby the first dose is at the date of choice and the second dose ranges from six to twelve months after the first dose .
if a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination is desired for h@@ epatitis A and h@@ epatitis B , it can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or a combination vacc@@ ine .
the anti @-@ h@@ epatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ h@@ epatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ h@@ epatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ h@@ epatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ h@@ epatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured whether immun@@ o@@ competent individuals who have responded to h@@ epatitis C ino@@ cul@@ ation may require re@@ juven@@ ation as protection , since they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in no longer det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 . as with all injection @-@ vacc@@ ines , for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the dispens@@ ing of the vacc@@ ine , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately .
if a fast protection against h@@ epatitis B is required , the standard protocol is recommended using the combination vacc@@ ine containing 360 ELISA units with a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated h@@ epatitis A virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and individuals with mal@@ functions of the immune system , there is no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ Bs anti @-@ mort@@ ar value after the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ isation , so that in these cases the addition of further vacc@@ inations may be required .
since an intra@@ ther@@ male injection or intr@@ am@@ us@@ cular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal vacc@@ ination in the but@@ to@@ sis muscle , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
however , with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected exceptionally sub@@ cut@@ aneous as it can come to ble@@ eding in these cases after intr@@ am@@ us@@ cular administration .
if Ambi@@ rix was ad@@ ministered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular paste , intra@@ operative poli@@ omyel@@ i@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ oph@@ il@@ us influ@@ enza type b @-@ vacc@@ ine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or combined with a combined meas@@ ur@@ - m@@ umps @-@ rub@@ ella vacc@@ ine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it has to be assumed that no sufficient immune response is achieved .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ inations of this formulation in adults , the inci@@ dence of pain , red@@ ness , sw@@ elling , mat@@ ernity , g@@ astro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ ache and fever comparable to the inci@@ dence that was observed in the previous thi@@ om@@ ers@@ al and preser@@ v@@ ative @-@ containing vacc@@ ine formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ inations were ad@@ ministered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 up to 15 years .
in a study of 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared to the 3 @-@ dose combination vacc@@ ine .
the only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and mat@@ acity on a calculation basis per vacc@@ ination dose Ambi@@ rix , but not based on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix in 5@@ 0,7 % of the subjects , compared to 39.@@ 1 % in subjects after the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ dose combination vacc@@ ine .
after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects who had given Ambi@@ rix had reported about pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vacc@@ ine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ernity was comparable to that per pro@@ band ( i.e. over the total vacc@@ ination cycle at 39.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix , compared to 36.@@ 2 % in the subjects who received the 3 @-@ dose combination vacc@@ ine ) .
the frequency of severe pain and mat@@ ernity was low and comparable to those observed after administration of the combination vacc@@ ine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ine regim@@ en .
in a compar@@ ative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the presence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ gruppe was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3 @-@ dose combination vacc@@ ine with 360 ELISA units formally in@@ activated h@@ epatitis A virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11@@ - year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix was reported a more frequent occurrence of p@@ ains ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per pro@@ band .
the share of vacc@@ ines that reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ine with the combination vacc@@ ine with 360 ELI@@ SA@@ - units formally in@@ activated h@@ epatitis A virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface an@@ tigen was statisti@@ cally not different .
in clinical trials conducted in vacc@@ ines aged 1 up to 15 years , the dose rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V were 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the Ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for Anti @-@ H@@ Bs were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a compar@@ ative study carried out between 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 cans of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were given the standard combination vacc@@ ine with three cans .
for the 289 individuals whose immun@@ ogen@@ icity was exp@@ end@@ able , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) against h@@ epatitis B were significantly higher in the month 2 and 6 after offering the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ine significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune responses , which were achieved in a clinical compar@@ ative study from 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after the full ino@@ cul@@ ation series ( i.e. , in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination pattern with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ine with a combination vacc@@ ine with 360 ELISA units formally in@@ activated h@@ epatitis A virus and 10@@ µg of re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in people who were at the time of prim@@ acy between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ Bs could be detected over at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immune reaction observed in this study was comparable to those observed after vacc@@ ination of 3 cans with a combination vacc@@ ine consisting of 360 ELISA units formally in@@ activated h@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study from 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ Bs antibodies comparable to 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ine is comparable to that in the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ine scheme .
if the first dose Ambi@@ rix was ad@@ ministered at the same time with the re@@ juven@@ ation of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ i@@ tis@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ oph@@ il@@ us influ@@ enza type b @-@ vacc@@ ine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ urer @-@ m@@ umps @-@ m@@ umps @-@ vacc@@ ine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates similar to the earlier formulation .
the vacc@@ ine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ pen@@ ge on any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes .
in accordance with article 114 of the Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art collection is carried out by a state laboratory or an authorized laboratory for this purpose .

the h@@ epatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral food@@ stuffs and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as bathing in water contam@@ inated by sew@@ age .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a p@@ ale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yellow addi@@ ction ) and other symptoms that may possibly make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix cannot completely protect prior to an infection with h@@ epatitis A or h@@ epatitis B virus , even if the full ino@@ cul@@ ation series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child are already infected with h@@ epatitis A or h@@ epatitis B virus prior to the administration of both vacc@@ ine doses ( although you / your child will not feel un@@ comfortable or sick at the vacc@@ ine time ) vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections affecting the liver or causing symptoms similar to those in h@@ epatitis A or h@@ epatitis B infection cannot be convey@@ ed .
• If you have already shown an allergic reaction to ambient rix or any component of this vacc@@ ine including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction may manifest itself through it@@ chy skin r@@ ashes , breathing or sw@@ elling of the face or tongue . if you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against h@@ epatitis A or h@@ epatitis B , if you / your child have a serious infection with fever .
• If you want to quickly have a protection against h@@ epatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the usual administration of the second vacc@@ ination ) .
with a possible risk of infection with h@@ epatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , it will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined h@@ epatitis B / h@@ epatitis B vacc@@ ine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ination ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated h@@ epatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant h@@ epatitis B surface ) .
the second vacc@@ ine of this vacc@@ ine with decreased content of effective ingredients is usually ad@@ ministered one month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection prior to ending the vacc@@ ine series .
sometimes am@@ bition is inj@@ ected for people who suffer from severe ble@@ eding disorders , under the skin and not inj@@ ected into the muscle . • If you / your child is weak@@ ened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s defense / is or if you / your child undergo / undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take other medicines ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated with no prescription ) or if you / your child has recently been vacc@@ inated / has received or has received immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) or has been planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vacc@@ ine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both h@@ epatitis A and B viruses .
if another vacc@@ ine has to be given with Ambi@@ rix at the same time , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as different limb@@ s as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix should be ad@@ ministered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vacc@@ ine will still be sufficient .
usually , am@@ bition is not ad@@ ministered to pregnant or breast@@ feeding women , except it is urgent that they are vacc@@ inated both against h@@ epatitis A and h@@ epatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix . please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) for you / your child .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ Normal ( more than 1 case per 10 dec@@ im@@ ated cans ) : • P@@ ain or dis@@ comfort at the inser@@ tion point or red@@ ness • Mat@@ eness • irrit@@ ability • head@@ ache • lack of appeti@@ te
♦ Standard ( up to 1 case per 10 dec@@ im@@ ated doses ) : • sw@@ elling at the injection site • fever ( about 38 ° C ) • Di@@ st@@ alli@@ bility • Ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal complaints
further side effects , the days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against h@@ epatitis A and h@@ epatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 dec@@ im@@ ated doses ) are reported :
these include limited or extensive r@@ ashes that can be it@@ ching or da@@ zzle @-@ shaped , sw@@ elling of the eye area and the face , t@@ ear@@ ing breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden blood pressure drop and un@@ consciousness .

23 Information your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects you / your child significantly affects or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this package insert .
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of the data that has been known for placing the first permit for the placing of the market , CH@@ MP advoc@@ ated that the benefit @-@ risk relationship for Ambi@@ rix has remained positive .
however , since Ambi@@ rix was placed in transport only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to low patient exposure .
ammon@@ ia can also be used in patients aged over a month with in@@ complete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ium @-@ enc@@ ephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
ammon@@ ia is divided into several individual doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed with food or through a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading tube ) or a nas@@ al onde ( through the nose into the stomach of leading tube ) .
it was not a compar@@ ative study because am@@ mon@@ ites could not be compared with another treatment or plac@@ ebo ( a pseu@@ do @-@ drug , i.e. without active ingredient ) .
ammon@@ ia can also lead to loss of appeti@@ te , a ab@@ normal aci@@ dity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , impot@@ ence , fluid retention , taste disorders or taste seeds , stomach aches , v@@ om@@ iting , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin r@@ ash , unpleasant bodily odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevents ammon@@ ia values .
&quot; &quot; &quot; am@@ mon@@ ite was approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the rar@@ ity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information to this drug . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients where a complete enzyme deficiency has already been manifest@@ ed in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 life days ) .
in patients with a late mani@@ f@@ ect form ( in@@ complete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first lifetime ) , there is an indication for use when a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia enc@@ ephal@@ opathy is found in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for inf@@ ants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing dis@@ rup@@ tions , AM@@ 89@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ulated form .
the daily dose is calculated individually taking into account the protein intoler@@ ance and the daily protein intake of the patient for the growth and development .
according to clinical experience , normal daily dose is sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg , as well as adol@@ escents and adults .
the substitu@@ tion of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients who suffer from an early manifest@@ o lack of carb@@ onic phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ly meat .
ar@@ gin@@ ine deficiency in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8,@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day should be obtained .
AM@@ B@@ PS tablets may not be ad@@ ministered to patients with swal@@ lowing dis@@ rup@@ tions , as there is a risk for the emergence of es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a when the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
each tablet consists of 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ P MONA@@ PS should therefore be used with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma .
since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl but@@ yr@@ ate is done via the liver and kid@@ neys , AM@@ P MONA@@ PS should be used for patients with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution .
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ P MONA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats with high dosage ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cer@@ eb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ P MONA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated while breast @-@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ P MONA@@ PS at 56 % of patients at least an adverse event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ P MONA@@ PS .
frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ HT@@ P ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old an@@ or@@ ect@@ tic patient who developed a met@@ abolic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ tic aci@@ do@@ sis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ oc@@ top@@ enia , peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ atitis .
an over@@ dose case occurred in a 5 month old inf@@ ant with an acci@@ dental dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms proceed with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity in an intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abolic active compound that con@@ ju@@ gates glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kid@@ neys .
an@@ ec@@ ri@@ cally seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the elimination of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram of the sodium phen@@ yl but@@ yr@@ ate between 0.15 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical results .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest@@ o form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ licted , and the disease itself led to death even in the treatment of per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen free an@@ alogues within the first year of life .
by hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , utilization of alternative methods of nitrogen elimination ( sodium phen@@ yl but@@ yr@@ ate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced food and possibly substitu@@ tion of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns in post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first month of life ) to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which were already treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia enc@@ ephal@@ opathy , survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it was time with many mental disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late @-@ manifest@@ ed form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ ic form of the or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ko@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were recovered from hyper@@ hi@@ bi@@ ous enc@@ ephal@@ opathy and treated permanently with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly re@@ versible for treatment and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical condition can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in liver and kidney cells with glut@@ amine , where phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is formed .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined according to a single dose of 5 g of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism and with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis according to individual release as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients after intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral dose of 5 g of sodium phen@@ yl but@@ yr@@ ate in tablet form , 15 minutes after taking measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate were detected .
according to different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) in the next morning no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma was det@@ ectable in the majority of patients with ure@@ a @-@ oc@@ cl@@ usions or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in .
in three of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( 20 g / day oral in three individual doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma tor@@ ch on the third day were five times higher than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine above the kid@@ neys .
according to the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test results , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate had no concl@@ usive effects ( investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ B@@ PS Gran@@ ules are either or@@ ally taken ( inf@@ ants and children who cannot swal@@ low any tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing dis@@ rup@@ tions ) or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch or a nas@@ al onde .
according to clinical experience , normal daily dose is sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg , as well as adol@@ escents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
the substitu@@ tion of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients who suffer from an early manifest@@ o lack of carb@@ onic phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ ly meat .
AM@@ HT@@ P gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat fl@@ utes were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active met@@ abolic of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ) , it came to l@@ esi@@ ons in the pyr@@ ami@@ ds cells of the brain c@@ ort@@ ex .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ HT@@ P ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old an@@ or@@ ect@@ tic patient who developed a met@@ abolic enc@@ ephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ tic aci@@ do@@ sis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ oc@@ top@@ enia , peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ atitis .
clin@@ ically seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it can be assumed that for each gram , sodium phen@@ yl but@@ yr@@ ate is produced between 0.15 and 0.15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly re@@ versible , and in some patients further wor@@ sen@@ ing of the neurolog@@ ical condition can occur .
after an oral dosage of 5 g of sodium phen@@ yl but@@ yr@@ ate in gran@@ ulate form , 15 minutes after taking measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate were detected .
during the duration of durability the patient can store the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C .
this procedure contains the small measuring spo@@ on 0,@@ 95 g , the average measuring spo@@ on 2.9 g and the large measuring spo@@ on 8.6 g of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate .
if a patient has to receive the medication via a probe , AM@@ HT@@ P can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl but@@ yr@@ ate is up to 5 g in 10 ml water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen containing waste products that accum@@ ulate in the body after consuming proteins .
if you are taking laboratory tests , you need to tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ P MONA@@ PS because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can influence the results of certain laboratory studies .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or taken recently , even if it is not prescription drugs .
during the lac@@ tation period , you may not take AM@@ P MONA@@ PS as the medicine could go over to breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , head@@ ache , taste distur@@ ban@@ ces , ob@@ struction of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory distur@@ ban@@ ces and a deteri@@ oration of existing neurolog@@ ical conditions were observed .
if you notice any of these symptoms , you immediately get in touch with your doctor or the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of initi@@ ating a corresponding treatment .
if you have forgotten the intake of AM@@ P MONA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .
changes in the blood image ( red blood cells , white blood cells , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes ) , decreased appeti@@ te , depression , irrit@@ ability , head@@ ache , impot@@ ence , stomach pain , v@@ om@@ iting , nau@@ sea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , unpleasant skin odor , skin r@@ ash , kidney function , weight gain and an@@ om@@ al laboratory values .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this use information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you may not use AM@@ P MONA@@ PS after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date and the container after &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Use until &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; specified exp@@ iry date . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; how AM@@ P MONA@@ PS looks and contents of the package AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish colour and oval shape , and they are provided with the em@@ bos@@ sing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; U@@ CY 500 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
30 If you are carried out laboratory tests , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ P MONA@@ PS because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate can influence the results of certain laboratory studies .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or taken recently , even if it is not prescription drugs .
you should take AM@@ P MONA@@ PS to take the same single doses or@@ ally or via a gast@@ ric fi@@ or ( tube which runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al onde ( hose that is fed through the nose into the stomach ) .

angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes ( AC@@ S , decreased blood supply to the heart ) , for example with inst@@ able ang@@ ina ( a form of p@@ ains in the chest of different thick@@ nesses ) or m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ al inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stress &quot; ( an an@@ om@@ al measurement value in electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if An@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is ad@@ ministered and inf@@ usion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S , in which the effect of angi@@ ox was compared to the conventional combination treatment with he@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , other medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) .
during the PCI , the patient was frequently used a st@@ ent ( a short tube which remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent cl@@ utter ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent cl@@ ots , such as ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of AC@@ S , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the administration of GP@@ I - was as effective in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or vas@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation ) after 30 days and a year as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients who undergo a PCI therapy , An@@ gi@@ ox was as effective in all indicators as he@@ par@@ in , except for severe ble@@ eding , in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ ox may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ val@@ er@@ udi@@ n , other her@@ ds@@ mi@@ des or one of the other constitu@@ ents .
it may not be used in patients who had a ble@@ eding recently , as well as in people with severe high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for he@@ par@@ in during the treatment of AC@@ S and during a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to introduce an@@ ox across the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non - ST @-@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ) ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency intervention or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initial dosage of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intra@@ ven@@ ous acu@@ ity of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an inf@@ usion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is carried out in a further consequence , an additional Bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and inf@@ usion is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery .
after the PCI , the reduced inf@@ usion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical needs .
immediately before the procedure , a stu@@ d of 0.5 mg / kg should be ad@@ ministered , followed by an inf@@ usion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention .
the recommended Dos@@ age of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with one PCI consists of an initial intra@@ ven@@ ous cap@@ s@@ ulation of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an intra@@ ven@@ ous inf@@ usion immediately followed by a dose of 1.75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a single Bol@@ us administration of An@@ gi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is short@@ ened to under 225 seconds , a second release of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place .
in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the re@@ formed and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed before the application and the bol@@ us dose is quickly ad@@ ministered intra@@ ven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.75 mg / kg inf@@ usion do@@ sis is ad@@ ministered correctly .
in patients with severe kidney function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with bi@@ val@@ er@@ udi@@ n against AC@@ S or not ) , a lower inf@@ usion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is below 225 seconds , a second cap@@ tive dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be ad@@ ministered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ doc@@ sis can be examined again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , included in the II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which resulted in the approval , the ACT was 5 minutes after offering the bi@@ val@@ ira bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the end of the intra@@ ven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molec@@ ule he@@ par@@ in .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other constitu@@ ents or against Hir@@ ud@@ ine • active ble@@ eding or increased blood @-@ risk due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of the hem@@ ost@@ asis and / or irre@@ versible bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of ble@@ eding , especially when bi@@ valent in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant is ad@@ ministered ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if the most ble@@ eding of arter@@ ial pun@@ ctu@@ ation occurs in PCI patients , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) may occur throughout the treatment of ble@@ eding throughout the treatment .
in patients who are taking war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ er@@ udi@@ n , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after setting of treatment with bi@@ val@@ er@@ udi@@ n returns once again the level existing before the treatment .
based on the knowledge about the active mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) , it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of blood .
in the combination of bi@@ val@@ er@@ udi@@ s with plat@@ el@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ates or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ asis parameters are regularly monitored .
the experimental studies are in@@ adequate with regard to the effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see under section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to bi@@ val@@ ira alone , 4@@ 604 were random@@ ised to bi@@ val@@ ira plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 4@@ 603 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the bi@@ valent group as well as in the compar@@ ative groups treated with he@@ par@@ in , women and patients more than 65 years of age were more common in adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe ble@@ edings were defined according to A@@ cu@@ ity and Tim@@ i scales for severe ble@@ eding as in the foot@@ notes of Table 2 .
both light and severe ble@@ edings were significantly less frequent in bi@@ valent studies than in groups with he@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ - inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cu@@ ity severe ble@@ eding has been defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular ble@@ eding or ble@@ eding in the point of point , reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in level of ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood supply , re@@ operation due to ble@@ eding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed ble@@ eding loc@@ aliz@@ ations which occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , g@@ astro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck .
the following data on side effects are based on data from a clinical trial with bi@@ val@@ er@@ udi@@ n in 6000 patients under@@ going a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n group and in the compar@@ ative groups treated with he@@ par@@ in , women and patients more than 65 years were more common in adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both light and severe ble@@ eding occurred significantly less frequently under Bi@@ val@@ ira than in the compar@@ ative group under He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported in practice following a comprehensive application and are group@@ ed according to system organ@@ classes in table 6 .
in the event of an over@@ dose , the treatment with bi@@ val@@ er@@ udi@@ n is immediately canc@@ eled and the patient is closely inter@@ mes@@ h@@ ed with regard to signs of ble@@ eding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains bi@@ val@@ ir@@ cular , a direct and specific thro@@ mb@@ in@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic center and the Ani@@ onic Bin@@ ding region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether it is bound in the liquid phase or at t@@ inn@@ sel .
the Bin@@ ding of Bi@@ val@@ ira in Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and with it its effect , is re@@ versible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , in turn , re@@ generates the binding of bi@@ val@@ er@@ udi@@ n AR@@ G3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thus re@@ generating the function of the active center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , bi@@ val@@ ir@@ rel with ser@@ um of patients , in which in the past , had come to he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia / he@@ par@@ in@@ indu@@ z@@ ated th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ enia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) , did not indu@@ ce th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes aggregate reaction .
in healthy subjects and in patients , bi@@ val@@ ir@@ rel shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent an@@ tik@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is proven by the extension of ACT , a@@ P@@ TT , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was performed in the following cases an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5mg / kg should be given and the inf@@ usion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in arm A of the A@@ cu@@ ity trial , un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was ad@@ ministered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with inst@@ able ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ stroke inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ised to receive a G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the beginning of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or with the PCI .
in the A@@ cu@@ ity study , the characteristics of high risk patients , which required an angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were spread ev@@ enly across the 3 treatment arms .
approximately 77 % of patients had a recur@@ ring isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - changes or increased cardi@@ ac biom@@ ar@@ kers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients under@@ gone within 72 hours of angi@@ ography .

clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of bi@@ val@@ er@@ udi@@ n were evaluated in patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with AC@@ S .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adol@@ escents and children from six years with diabetes which require treatment with ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected into the abdominal wall , thig@@ h or upper arm or ad@@ ministered as a continuous inf@@ usion with an ins@@ ulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough ins@@ ulin to regulate the glu@@ cose level ( sugar ) in the blood or the ins@@ ulin is not effective .
ins@@ ulin fluctu@@ ate differs very slightly from human ins@@ ulin , and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter active duration as a short @-@ lived human ins@@ ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in the application in combination with a long @-@ effective ins@@ ulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body cannot produce ins@@ ulin in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between 4 and 17 years .
in case of type 2 diabetes , where the body ins@@ ulin is not processed effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of pot@@ ency was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , decreased after six months a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) in comparison to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % at ins@@ ulin li@@ spr@@ o .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0,30 % in human normal ulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to ins@@ ulin cl@@ ine or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
A@@ pi@@ dra cans may need to be adjusted if it is ad@@ ministered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glu@@ cose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission informed the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ enti@@ s Deutschland GmbH a permit for the placing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the abdominal wall , thig@@ h or del@@ ta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous inf@@ usion into the area of abdominal bags .
due to the reduced glu@@ con@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis and the reduced ins@@ ulin metabolism , ins@@ ulin needs can be reduced in patients with a limitation of liver function .
any change of the active strength , the brand ( producer ) , the ins@@ ulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed etc . ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can withdraw a change in the ins@@ ulin demand .
3 An in@@ adequate dosage or ab@@ rup@@ ture of treatment , especially in patients with ins@@ ulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ do@@ sis ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening .
the conversion of one patient to another ins@@ ulin type or ins@@ ulin of another manufacturer should be conducted under strict medical supervision and can make a change of the dosage required .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active profile of the ins@@ ulin used and can therefore change in the conversion of the treatment regim@@ en .
the substances that increase the blood @-@ bearing activity and increase the prop@@ ens@@ ity to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia are oral anti@@ diabe@@ tic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ op@@ yr@@ amide , fi@@ br@@ ate , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mon@@ ot@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , sul@@ ph@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ in , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ s , s@@ aliz@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ ph@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , the effects of sympath@@ oly@@ tics such as beta lo@@ osen , Cl@@ oni@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ i@@ din and Reser@@ pin may be weak@@ ened or missing the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ regulation .
experimental studies of re@@ productive tox@@ icity revealed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ lu@@ li@@ sin and human ins@@ ulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known if ins@@ ulin reaction occurs in human breast milk , but in general ins@@ ulin does not occur in the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ b@@ ated after oral application .
listed below are listed in clinical studies classified by undes@@ irable pharmaceutical short@@ ages ( very often : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally : ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on the available data is not in@@ estim@@ able ) .

Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy &apos;s failure to continuously change the injection site within the injection @-@ area can result in a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection site .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intr@@ am@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by an appropri@@ ately trained person or treated by a doctor by intra@@ ven@@ ous ad@@ dic@@ tions .
after glu@@ cose , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar epis@@ odes .
ins@@ ulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimul@@ ating the peripher@@ al glu@@ cose absorption ( especially skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as the in@@ hibition of glu@@ cose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ it of ins@@ ulin sensitivity the efficiency occurs faster and the duration is shorter than with hu@@ g @-@ man@@ em normal ins@@ ulin .
in a study of 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes milk , ins@@ ulin fluctu@@ ation showed a propor@@ tion@@ ate glu@@ cose @-@ giving effect in the therapeutic dose of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.15 E / kg , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a propor@@ tion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cose @-@ giving effect , just like human ins@@ ulin .
ins@@ ulin flow is twice as fast as normal human ins@@ ulin and achieves the complete glu@@ cose @-@ giving effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human ins@@ ulin .
the data was evident that in an application of ins@@ ulin reactions 2 minutes before the meal a similar post @-@ pran@@ ic gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is reached , as with a human@@ ely normal ins@@ ulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
was ins@@ ulin @-@ swal@@ lowed 2 minutes before meal , a better post@@ pran@@ dial control was reached than with a human normal ins@@ ulin , which was given 2 minutes before meal .
if ins@@ ulin tea is consumed 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a similar gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved as with a human normal ulin , which is given 2 minutes before the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) .
ins@@ ulin flow in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ LI@@ SIN - before ) before the start of the meal was given before the start of the meal ( Fig 1A ) as well as compared to human normal ulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ B ) .
ins@@ ulin production at the gift of 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ LI@@ SIN - after ) after the start of the meal compared to human nor@@ - mal@@ in@@ ulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ C ) .
