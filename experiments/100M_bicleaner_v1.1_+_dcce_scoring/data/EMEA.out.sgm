<seg id="1">The present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your illness or treatment, please read the package insert (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you would like more information on the basis of CHMP's recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for taking (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirl thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or vision of things that are not present), mistrust and delusion; • Bipolar disorder, a mental illness in which the patients have various episodes (periods of abnormal high-tuning) alternating with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe mental episodes and for prevention of manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased restlessness or behavioural disturbances if the oral consumption of the medication is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both cases, the solution can be applied or the melting tablets are used in patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who take other medicines at the same time, same as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This affects the signal transmission between brain cells through "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of nerve cells to each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol presumably appears as a "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that aripiprazole acts like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in lesser degree than the neurotransmitter to activate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">As dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazol helps to normalize the activity of the brain, reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and prevents its recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies over up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which suffered from increased unrest, over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol in another study, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence of 160 patients in which the manic symptoms were already stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder that suffered from increased unrest, with which from Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in patients "symptoms based on a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to treatment was investigated.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body resorbates the melting tablets and the solution for intake.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two studies with the injection solution patients demonstrated Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased unrest than the patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify decreased in four of the five short-term studies manic symptoms more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented the recurrence of manic episodes with previously treated patients for up to 74 weeks and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Bilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses also reduced more effectively than placebo, symptoms of increased unrest and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common Abilify side effects (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapyramidale disruptions, tremor (trembase), sedation, nausea (nausea), obstipation (constipation), obstipation (increased saliva production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Abilify in treating schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes addressed the treatment with Aripiprazol, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the Committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of the injection solution in rapid control of increased unrest and behavioral disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with bipolar disorder, if oral therapy is not appropriate, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "in June 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the placing of Abilify in the entire European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mostly manic episodes and whose manic episodes addressed the treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased effectiveness of dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, regardless of the meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors are justified (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicide behavior belongs to psychotic illnesses and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after a change of an anti-psychotic therapy, even in the treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder, there was no increased risk of suicide with Aripiprazol compared to other anti-psychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazol should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (cardiac insufficiency, conduction disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotony (dehydration, hypoglycaemia, treatment with blood-lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting one year or less, there were occasional reports on dyskinesia occurring during treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the symptoms and symptoms of late dysphagia are treated with Abilify, the dose should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">When a patient develops signs and symptoms pointing to a MNS, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Aripiprazol should be applied with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or at states associated with seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years old with Aripiprazol in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease had patients treated with Aripiprazol, an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there was in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and response for adverse cerebrovascular events with Aripiprazol treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no exact risk assessments for hyperglycemia related adverse events in patients treated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic agents that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes Mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes Mellitus should be monitored regularly with regard to deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar deficiency, the use of anti-psychotics, in which weight gain is known as a secondary effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary efficacy of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advisable when Aripiprazol is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with overlying side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazol, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical trial with healthy subjects, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC from Aripiprazol by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore should be similar dose-reductions.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolism can result in the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazol compared to CYP2D6 extensioners.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the common administration of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should weigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV proteaseinhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore should be similar dose-reductions.</seg>
<seg id="55">After the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dosage height prior to the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 are administered together with Abilify, can be expected with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies, doses of 10-30 mg of aripiprazole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphinan-Ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazole) and 3A4 (Dextromethium).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the inadequate data situation for safety in humans and due to the concerns raised in reproductive studies, this drug may not be used in pregnancy unless the possible benefit justifies the potential risk of the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other anti-psychotics, patients should be warned against dangerous machines including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole does not have any negative impact on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events occurred more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The incidence of side effects mentioned below is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of over 52 weeks, in patients treated with Aripiprazol, a total decreased incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathogenic, Dystonia and Dyskinesia, compared to patients treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients with Aripiprazol treatment and 13.1% in patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazol was 15.1% in patients with orthosis therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in Bipolar-I-disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23.5% in patients with aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3.3% in patients with haloperiidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients with Aripiprazol treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients suffering from aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under aripiprazole and placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes of routinely monitored laboratory parameters did not result in unmedically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases of CPK (creatine phosphate kinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazol, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">The side effects associated with an anti-psychotic therapy are the malignant neuroletic syndrome, late dysphagia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes Mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or intentional overdosages with Aripiprazol were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death sequence.</seg>
<seg id="73">There is no information about the effectiveness of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazol; however, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of an overdose, since Aripiprazol has a high plasmaprotein bonding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder is mediated over the combination of a partial agonist effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">In vitro, Aripiprazol demonstrated a high affinity for dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT2a receptor as well as an even affinity to dopamine D4-, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, alpha-1-adrenergic and histamine H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">During the dose of aripiprazole in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for two weeks of healthy subjects, the positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction in binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, nucleus caudatus and at the putative.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a semi-eriidol-controlled trial in week 52 the share of responder patients, who retained a response to the study medication, was similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measuring scales defined as secondary studies including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- depression rate scale showed a significantly stronger improvement than with Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazol showed a significantly higher reduction in the decline rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprazol group and at 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapin controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients treated and in which the primary study was' weight gain ', in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy trials with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazol demonstrated a proven efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic features, Aripiprazol demonstrated a efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect that was comparable to that of Lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, Aripiprazol demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the manie in week 12 such as lithium or semi-operiidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, which in some cases did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy with therapeutic serum mirrors, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazol demonstrated a superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or Valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension of over 74 weeks in manic patients with Aripiprazol before randomisation a remission occurred, Aripiprazole was superior to placebo with regard to the prevention of a bipolar decline, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the manie.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxiation of Aripiprazol, the N-Dealkyformulation is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole in extensive metabolism via CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolic rollers via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazol, there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as well as a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients had no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A population-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics gave no indication of clinically significant differences with regard to ethnical belonging or the impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazol were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy subjects.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with various liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazol, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the carcinogenic potential, the preclinical data did not reveal any particular hazards to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only with dosages or expositions which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent side-kidney toxicity (Lipofuscin-Pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times the average Steady State exposure (AUC) in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (the 10 times the average Steady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dosage in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholelithiasis was detected as a result of the erosion of the hydroxy- metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkey after repeated oral exposure of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the mean Steady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dosage or the 16- to 81eys of the recommended maximum dosage in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations of the sulfate-conjugate of hydroxy- aripiprazole were not more than 6% of concentrations observed in the study over 39 weeks in the Galle of apes, and are far below the limits (6%) of in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages that led to expositions of the 3 and 11 times of the average Steady State AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="143">Abilify injection solution is used for fast control of agility and behavioural disturbances in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes of bipolar disorder, if oral therapy is not appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="144">Once it is clinically appropriate, the treatment with Aripiprazol injection solution should be terminated and started with the oral application of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="145">To increase resorption and minimize the variability, an injection into the M. deltoideus or deep into the gluteus maximus muscle is recommended in obese regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5,25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given depending on individual clinical status, taking into account the medicines used already for maintenance or acute treatment (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If a further orale treatment with Aripiprazol is indicated, see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to Abilify tablets, Abilify Schmelztabletten or Abilify solution for inclusion.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no investigations on the efficacy of Aripiprazol Injection's solution in patients with Agion and behavioral disruptions caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar disorder.</seg>

<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar deficiency because of comorbidities, the use of anti-psychotics, in which weight gain is known as a secondary effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the Sedation was greater compared to the allotment of Aripiprazol, in a study where healthy subjects were used as an intramuscular response (15 mg dose) and which at the same time received Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, decreases the resorption rate of Aripiprazol, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolic sufferers can result in the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as itraconazole and HIV- proteaseinuptake inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore should be similar dose-reductions.</seg>
<seg id="160">After the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dosage height prior to the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dose) were intramuscular, the intensity of the Sedation was greater compared to that after allure of Aripiprazole.</seg>

<seg id="166">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients with aripiprazol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients with Aripiprazol treatment and 15.7% was treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under aripiprazole and placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes of routinely monitored laboratory parameters did not result in unmedically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases of CPK (creatinphosphate kinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazol, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">The side effects associated with an anti-psychotic therapy are the malignant neuroletic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-time study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as Agiottization and behavioral disruptions, the Aripiprazol injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the symptoms regarding the Agion and behavioral dysfunctions compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The mean improvement of the initial value at the PANSS Excitement Component score on the primary 2-hour final point was 5.8 for placebo, 9,6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of sub-groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe agility, a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population, but a statistical significance could be detected due to reduced patient numbers.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a semi-eriidol-controlled trial in week 52 the share of responder patients, who retained a response to the study medication, was similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% (oral) and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>

<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, which in some cases did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy with therapeutic serum mirrors, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazol demonstrated a superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or Valproat.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study extension in manic patients who had reached a remission with Aripiprazol before randomisation, Aripiprazol demonstrated against placebo with regard to the prevention of a bipolar decline, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the manie.</seg>
<seg id="182">The Aripiprazol AUC is 90% greater in the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection as a tablet; systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy subjects, the mean time to reach the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The administration of Aripiprazol injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated use during a systemic exposure (AUC), the 15- and 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intramuscular lay.</seg>

<seg id="186">Based on the conventional studies with aripiprazole (oral) for safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the carcinogenic potential, the preclinical data did not reveal any particular hazards to humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only with dosages or expositions which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans; therefore, they have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent side-kidney toxicity (Lipofuscin-Pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to 3 to 10 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (the 10 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dosage in humans).</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, of which about three quarters were formerly an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in the sole gift or as monotherapy) was compared with the drug containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">In total, the main study was 72 (31%) of the patients treated with Abraxane in the treatment of 37 (16%) of the 225 patients who received conventional paclitaxel treatments.</seg>
<seg id="270">If one considers only those patients treated for metastatic breast cancer, there was no difference between the efficacy indicators like time and the worsening of the disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">In contrast, patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It may not be used in patients who breastfeed or have low neutrophils in the blood before the treatment begins.</seg>
<seg id="273">The CHMP medical drug (CHMP) committee noted that Abraxane was no more effective than conventional paclitaxel and that in contrast to other paclitaxel drugs, it would not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission issued Abraxis BioScience Limited a permit for the transport of Abraxane throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane-monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients where the first-line therapy for metastatic disease is missing and for which a standard anthracycline therapy is not indicated (see also Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophils &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during the Abraxane therapy, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series.</seg>
<seg id="277">In sensory neuropathy grade 3 treatment must be interrupted until a recovery is achieved to grade 1 or 2, and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced.</seg>

<seg id="279">No studies were conducted with patients with impaired kidney function and there is currently no adequate data to recommend dose adjustments in patients with impairment of kidney function (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="280">Abraxane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data about safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="281">Abraxane is an Albumin-based nano-articulated formulation of paclitaxel, which could have other pharmacological features than other formulations of paclitaxel (see section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>

<seg id="285">While a clearly associated cardiotoxicity was not proven, cardiac incidents in the indicated patient group are not unusual, especially in patients with early anthracycline treatment or underlying heart or lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">If in patients after the administration of Abraxane nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea occur, they can be treated with the usual antiemetic and constiptive methods.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be applied to pregnant women or women at childbearing age, which are not effective contraception, except treatment of mother with paclitaxel is unavoidable.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women at childbearing age should use a reliable method of contraception during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients who are treated with Abraxane are advised to produce no child during and up to six months after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised before the treatment of a spermatherapy because of the treatment with Abraxane, the possibility of irreversible infertility exists.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects like tiredness (very common) and dizziness (often) that can affect the traffic tightness and the ability to serve machines.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and most important incidents of side effects performed in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer which were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 abrasives in the pivotal clinical phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most conspicuous important hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl) in three cases.</seg>
<seg id="295">In Table 1, the side effects performed in conjunction with the administration of Abraxane as monotherapy in each dose and indication occurred in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate hydrogenase in the blood, increased levels of creatine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagia, flatulence, tongue firing, dry mouth, eless gums, loose stool, esophagitis, pain in the abdomen, ulcers in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of muscles, headaches, muscle spasms, pain in skeletal muscles, flank pain, discomfort in limbs, muscle weakness Very often:</seg>
<seg id="300">Helplessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions are calculated based on a definitive associated case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, there are no estimates of the actual incidence possible and no causal connection with these events has been established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an anti-microtubules active substance that promotes the interstorage of microtubules from the tubular indians and stabilizes microtubules by inhibition of their polymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interim period and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that Albumin mediates the transoctose of plasma components into the endothelial cells and in-vitro studies it has been demonstrated that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendoliial transport is mediated by the gp-60 albumming receptor and occurs due to the albuminous protein SPARC (secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine) a paclitaxel accumulation in the area of the tumour.</seg>
<seg id="306">The use of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by 106 patients in two unarmed unverbal studies and 454 patients treated in a Phase III randomised trial.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study, 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion of over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion in 63 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multi-centric study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer, which received monotherapy with paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in the form of solvent containing paclitaxel (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30-minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study 64% of patients had an impaired general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had previously received chemotherapy, 27% only had a adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only due to metastases and 19% due to metastasation and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the general response rate and time until progression of the disease as well as progression-free survival and survival for patients who receive first-line therapy are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to paclitaxel was evaluated by improving a degree for patients who experienced periphere Neuropathy grade 3 at a time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy for reducing baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The Pharmacokinetics of the overall Paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of abrasives with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was measured in clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="316">The active substance exposure (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analogue to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 The paclitaxel plasma concentration in patients with metastatic breast cancer in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dosage of 260 mg / m2 declined in a multiphase mode.</seg>
<seg id="318">The mean distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume indicates a far-reaching extravascular distribution and / or crossover linking of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study with patients with advanced solid tumors, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared with the values of a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearance of paclitaxel was higher after the Abraxane-giving (43%) than after a solvent containing paclitaxel injection, and also the volume of distribution was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers, paclitaxel is primarily metabolized to 6α hydroxypaclitaxel and two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-Hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value for cumulative urea separation of the unchanged active substance was 4% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the total metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p hydroxypaclitaxel, which indicates a far-reaching non-renal clearance.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data are available about patients at the age of 75, as only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">The chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box and protected against light light over 8 hours.</seg>

<seg id="358">• Training leaflet • Summary of the features of the medicine (professional information), labeling and packaging contributions. • With clear picture of the correct application of the product, cooling boxes for transport through the patient.</seg>
<seg id="359">This means that Abseamed is similar to a biological medicine that is already approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same substance (also called "reference drug").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood vessels that could occur in connection with blood transfusion complications, if a blood-donor is not possible in case of a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with abseamed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with disorders that the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a blood donation, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be made by the patient or his supervisor as long as they have received appropriate instructions.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy, hemoglobin values should always be in the recommended area (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron levels of all patients are checked before the treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists, and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia can be caused by an erythropoietine deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell containing a gene (DNA), which it enables to formation of epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared to injection in a vein as part of a major study involving 479 patients who suffered from kidney problems caused anemia, compared to the reference drug.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected in Eprex / Erypo for at least eight weeks before they were either converted to abseamed or received Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of the efficacy was the change in hemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of abseamed under the skin were examined with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study involving patients suffering from anaemia caused by renal problems, hemoglobin values of patients who were converted to abseamed were maintained in the same extent as with those patients who received Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, the patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is a rise in blood pressure, which can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, piercing migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed should not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or one of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Renamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that there are no allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that for Abseamed according to the European Union regulations, evidence was provided that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that provides Abseamed will provide information packages for medical professionals in all member states including information on the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission issued a permit for the company Medice Arzneimittel Pütter GmbH & Co KG a permit for the placing of abseamed in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion demand in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiplem myeloma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of transfusion is due to the general condition (e.g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia in the beginning of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">Treatment should only be carried out in patients with moderate anaemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6,2 - 8.1 mmol / l], if blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient, in case of planned larger surgical interventions, which require a large blood volume substitute (4 or more units blood in women; 5 or more units blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">Abseamed can be used to reduce external blood's blood from a large elective orthopaedic intervention in adults with no iron deficiency, where a high risk of transfusion complications is expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected loss of blood from 900-1800 ml are applied, which cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6,2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for pediatric patients, where the hemoglobin concentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l) should lie.</seg>
<seg id="386">Symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease load; therefore the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required by the physician.</seg>
<seg id="387">A rise in hemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1,25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values can occasionally be observed in a patient or under the hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">Given this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1,25 mmol / l) per month, or if the durable hemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is applied in the lowest approved dose, which is required for the control of anaemia and anaemia.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results suggest that patients with very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The present clinical results suggest that patients with very low Hb value (&lt; 6,8 g / dl or &lt; 4,25 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial anaemia is less difficult (Hb &gt; 6,8 g / dl or &gt; 4,25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dosage 50 I.U. / kg three times a week with intravenous application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Anaemia symptoms and follow-up symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease load; therefore, the assessment of individual clinical trials and condition of disease is required by the physician.</seg>
<seg id="396">Given this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose, which is required for the control of anaemia's symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 treatment weeks the hemoglobin value is increased by at least 1 g / dl (0,62 mmol / l) or the reticulocycles value increased to ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose of 150 I.U. / kg should be retained three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the hemoglobin ascent &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and the Retikulozyte number &lt; 40.000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose should be increased to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after another 4 treatment weeks with 300 I.U. / kg three times a week of the hemoglobin value of ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the reticulocycles of ≥ 40,000 cells / µl, the dose of 300 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the hemoglobin value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) or the Retikulozytes number by &lt; 40.000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, a response to the epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anaemia (haematocrit 33 - 39%) in which the precautionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood preserves is required should receive Abseamed in a dose of 600 I.U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">The iron substitution should be started as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the start of the autologous blood donation program - to prevent large iron reserves prior to the beginning of the Abseamed therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg etin alfa, which should be given weekly over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Epoetin alfa should be given preoperatively 300 I.E. / kg every 10 consecutive days, on the day of the surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection at the end of dialysis can be given over the hose of a fistula needle followed by 10 ml isotonic saline solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug in the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients who are diagnosed with any erythropoetin on a erythroblastopenie (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive abseamed or other erythropoetin (see section 4.4 - erythroblastopenie).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within a month prior to treatment, instabile angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thromboses (e.g. anamnestic, venous thromboembolia).</seg>
<seg id="409">In patients who are intended for a larger elective orthopaedic surgery and which can not participate in an autologous blood donation program, the use of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in the following pre-, escort or vascular diseases: severe coronary heart disease, vascular disease of carototides or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with a short heart attack or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastopenie (PRCA) Very rarely reported on the occurrence of an antibody mediated PRCA after months to years of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden effect loss, defined as reduction of hemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the Retikulozyte value should be determined and the usual causes for non-use (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminiums toxication, infections or infections, blood loss and hemolysis) are investigated.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the Retikulozyte value, taking into consideration the anemia (i.e. the Retikulozyten "index"), is reduced (&lt; 20.000 / mm3 or &lt; 20,000 / Mikroliter or &lt; 0,5%), the throcytes and leukocytes are normal, and if no other cause of active loss is found, the anti-erythropoetin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone marmarks for the diagnosis of a PRCA should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="413">Data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of abseamed in patients with a risk of antibody-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic kidney failure, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration under section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical studies, increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoesis-stimulating agents (ESA) were given with a hemoglobin target concentration of over 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit due to the addition of epoetines, if the hemoglobin concentration is increased by the concentration required for the control of anaemia symptoms and the avoidance of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The hemoglobin ascent should amount to approximately 1 g / dl (0,62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1,25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinically evident coronary heart disease or insufficiency, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration under section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present knowledge, the treatment of anaemia with epetin alfa is not accelerated in adults with kidney failure, which are not dialysis, the progression of renal insufficiency is not accelerated.</seg>
<seg id="420">For tumour patients with chemotherapy, a 2 - 3-week delay between epoetin-alfa and erythropoetin response should be considered for assessing the therapeutic efficiency of epoetin alfa and the erythropoetin response (patients who need to be transcoded).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is exceeded 2 g / dl (1,25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2, in order to minimize the risk of potential thrombotic events (see section 4.2) treatment of patients with chemotherapeutic anemia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the hemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to use recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk-weighing under the involvement of the respective patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are envisaged for a greater elective orthopaedic surgery, if possible, prior to the beginning of epoetin alfa treatment, the cause of anaemia is investigated and treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients who undergo a major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive appropriate thrombosis prophylaxis, since they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially with a underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it can not be excluded that in treatment with epoetin alfa for patients with an output rate of &gt; 13 g / dl a higher risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular events can exist.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled trials, epoetins were not proven that they improve overall survival in tumor patients with symptomatic anaemia or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy, when hemoglobin target concentration was initiated from 12 to 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.8 mmol / l)</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is applied together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporin dose should be adjusted to the rising haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies on tumour tissues there is no evidence of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF regarding hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>

<seg id="570">The administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen (remedies against infection) shortly after the application of Aclasta can reduce the symptoms appearing in the three days after infusion, such as fever, muscular pains, flu-like symptoms, joint pain and headaches.</seg>
<seg id="571">For the treatment of Paget's disease, Aclerxes may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease.</seg>
<seg id="572">Since the active ingredient in Aclerxes is the same as in Zometa, a part of the data material was used for the evaluation of Aclerxes.</seg>
<seg id="573">The first study included nearly 8 000 older women with osteoporosis, and the number of hip fractures and hip fractures was examined over a period of three years.</seg>
<seg id="574">The second study included 2 127 men and women with osteoporosis over 50 years, who had recently suffered a hip fracture; the number of fractures was examined over a period of up to five years.</seg>
<seg id="575">At Morbus Paget, Aclasta was tested in two studies of 357 patients and compared to a different bisphosphonate for six months.</seg>
<seg id="576">The main indicator of the efficacy was whether the content of the alkaline phosphatase in the serum (an enzyme that breaks down bone substance) in the blood returned to normalized or at least 75% compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study with elderly women, the risk of spinal fractures in patients was reduced by 70% over a period of three years compared to the patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="578">The risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41% compared to all patients with Aclasta (with or without any other osteoporosis treatment).</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study involving men and women with hip fractures, 9% of patients under Aclerxes had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of the patients under placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most side effects of Aclays occur within the first three days after infusion and are less frequent with repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclays may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to zoledronic acid or other bisphosphonates or other components.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonate patients, patients with Aclasta are subject to the risk of kidney problems, reactions to the infusion site and osteonecrose (loss of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">The manufacturer of Aclasta is providing information for doctors who prescribe Aclasta for the treatment of osteoporosis, as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="584">In April 2005, the European Commission issued Novartis Europharm Limited a permit for the launch of Aclasta in the entire European Union.</seg>

<seg id="587">The patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include: • The treatment supplement • Contrasting in pregnancy and in nursing women • Required adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, appropriate physical activity, non-smoking and a healthy diet • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to get back to medical or nursing aid</seg>
<seg id="588">Osteoporosis treatment • in postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men an intravenous infusion of 5 mg Aclasta is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture, the administration of infusion of Aclerxes is recommended two or more weeks after surgical treatment of hip fractures (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Aclasta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After treating the disease Paget with Aclasta a long remission period was observed in patients who responded to therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is very advisable in patients with Morbus Paget sufficient supply of calcium, accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclerxes (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.E. orally or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Aclerxes infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The incidence of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Aclerxes can be reduced by using paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after using Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney function disorder (see section 4.4) In patients with a Kreatinin Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended as limited clinical experiences are available for this patient group.</seg>
<seg id="597">Older patients (≥ 65 years) A dose adjustment is not necessary as the bioavailability, distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents Aclerxes are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age, because data about harmlessness and effectiveness are missing.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended for patients with severe kidney failure (Kreatinin Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min) because only limited clinical experience exists for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Pre-existing hypokalemia is to be treated with Aclasta before the beginning of treatment with Aclasta by adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid insertion of the effect of zoledronic acid on bone structure, a temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalemia can develop, whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclerxes (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is very advisable in patients with Morbus Paget sufficient supply of calcium, accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclerxes (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene, should be considered before an application of bisphosphonate with appropriate preventive dental treatment.</seg>
<seg id="604">For patients who require dental intervention, no data is available whether the interruption of the treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteoporosis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan for each patient and based on an individual benefits risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The incidence of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of Aclerxes can be reduced by using paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after using Aclerxes (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">Incidence of adverse side effect reported cases of atrial fibrillation was increased in patients who received Aclerxes (1,3%) (51 of 3,862) compared to patients who received placebo (0,6%) (22 of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]) the total frequency of atrial fibrillation between Aclerxes (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>
<seg id="609">Frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) adverse drug interactions are listed in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Renal dysfunctions Zoledronics was associated with kidney function disorders that expressed itself as a decrease in the renal function (i.e. an increase in serum-creatine) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change in the Kreatinin Clearance (measured annually before administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure and a restricted renal function were comparable in a clinical study of osteoporosis over three years between the Aclasta- and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in the serum-creatine within 10 days after administration was observed at 1.8% of patients treated with Aclerxes compared to 0.8% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of the lab findings, the temporary asymptomatic calcium values, which were below the normal fluctuation area (less than 2.10 mmol / l), were treated in 2.3% of patients treated with Aclasta in a large clinical study compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the Morbus Paget studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received supplementarily sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study of postmenopausal osteoporosis, in the study to avoid clinical fractures after a hip fracture and in the Morbus Paget trials (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures after a recently suffered hip fracture, the vitamin D-levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Aclerxes (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions After the administration of Zoledronic acid in a large clinical study, local reactions to the infusion site, such as redness, swelling and / or pain, were reported (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonecroses in the orthodontic area, especially in cancer patients, about osteoarthritis (primarily in the jaw area), were treated with bisphosphonate, including Zoledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteoporosis, and the majority of reports refers to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental attacks.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 patients with 7,736 patients received osteonecrosis in the orthodontic area in a patient treated with Aclerxes and with placebo treated.</seg>
<seg id="620">In the event of an overdose that leads to clinically relevant hypokalemia, a compensation can be obtained through the addition of oral calcium and / or an intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical efficacy in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Aclerxes 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was indicated in postmenopausal women (7,736 females aged 65 and 89 years) with either a bone density (BMD) T-Score for the thigh ≤ -2.5 with or without signs of an existing vertebral body structure.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric fluid body fractures Aclerxes reduced significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new vertebral fractures (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclerxes treated patients aged 75 and older had a 60% reduced risk of vertebral fractures compared to placebo-patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effect on hip fractures Aclerxes has a consistent effect over three years, which resulted in a reduced risk of hip fractures in a 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclerxes increased bone density on lumbar vertebral, hip and distal radius compared to placebo treatment significantly at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase of the bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the total hip by 6.0%, the thigh by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology With 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70), one year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies were taken from the pelvic Spine.</seg>
<seg id="628">In comparison to placebo, a microcomputerised (µCT) analysis showed an increase in the trabecular bone volume and the preservation of the trabeculary bone architecture.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal propeptide of type I- collagen (P1NP) in the serum and the beta-C telopeptid (b-CTx) in serum were determined in sub-groups of 517 to 1.246 patients in periodic intervals during the study period.</seg>
<seg id="630">The treatment with an annual 5 mg dose Aclerxes reduced BSAP by 30% compared to the initial value and was kept at 28% below the initial value of up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52% below the initial value of up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was reduced significantly by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55% below the initial value of up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">Vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125.000 I.U. orally or intramuscular) 2 weeks before infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">Overall mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Aclerxes, compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on the bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON-RFT study, Aclerxes treat the BMD on the total hip and thigh as compared to placebo treatment at all times.</seg>
<seg id="636">The Aclerxes treatment performed more than 24 months compared to placebo treatment to an increase in BMD by 5.4% on the total and 4.3% on the thigh.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON-RFT study, 508 men were randomised and in 185 patients the BMD was assessed after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a decrease in clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% in Aclerxes treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308), the once annual administration of Aclasta was not inferior to the weekly administration of Alendronat on the percentage change in the lumbar vertebra BMD after 24 months compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of the treatment with Morbus Paget of the bone Aclasta was examined in patients aged over 30 years with radiologically confirmed, especially light to moderate hebus Paget of the bone (mean serum mirror of alkaline phosphatase corresponds to 2.6fold up to 3-fold age-specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The efficacy of an infusion of 5 mg of Zoledronic acid compared to the intake of 30 mg of credronat once daily during 2 months was demonstrated in two six months comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the initial value for Aclerxes and Risedronat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as responder at the end of the six-month main study (responded to therapy) were included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">From the 143 with Aclerxes and 107 patients treated with Risedronat, the therapeutic response of 141 patients treated with Aclerxes, compared to 71 of patients treated with credronat, could be maintained at an average duration of the follow-up period of 18 months after application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg Zoledronic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data which proved to be a dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that the plasma torch increased rapidly to &lt; 10% of the peak value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h, followed by a long-lasting phase very low concentration, not more than 0.1% of the maximum.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphase disappearance from the large cycle with half-value t ½ α 0,24 and t ½ ß 1,87 hours, followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal Eliminationshal Cancer time t ½ γ 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above t ½ -values) presumably represent the fast resorption in the bones and the excretion over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours 39 ± 16% of the administered dose in the urine, while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body clearance is independent of the dose 5,04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion period from 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease in zoledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced clearance of metabolized substances by cytochrome-P450-enzyme systems is unlikely since Zoledronic acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or even no direct and / or irreversible, nutrient-dependent inhibitor of P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal clearance of the Zoledronics correlated with the Kreatinin Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the Kreatinin-Clearance, and in the 64 examined patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in an easy (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate dysfunctional disorder up down to a creatine-clearance up to 35 ml / min does not require the dosage adjustment of the citric acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">Because for severe kidney function disorder (Kreatinin- clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only limited data are available, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-letally effective intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and 0,6 mg / kg body weight in rats.</seg>
<seg id="657">In the case of studies in dogs individual doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on the AUC are the 6 times the recommended human-therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Chronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous application, the renal tolerance of zoledronic acid was administered in rats by doses of 0.6 mg / kg as a 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, in intervals of 2- 3 weeks (a cumulative dose, corresponding to the 7-fold of the human-therapeutic exposure referred to the AUC, corresponds), well tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated exposure to cumulative exposure levels, which exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure, toxicological effects occurred in other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract and liver, as well as intravenous injections.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common infection in studies with repeated use was an increasingly primary spongiosa in the metaphhysis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dosages, an infestation that reflects the pharmacological, anti-absorbable effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">Rats observed a teratogenicity in doses of 0.2 mg / kg as outer and internal (visceral) abnormalities and such a skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed in rabbits, although the maternal Toxicity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg due to the reduced serum calcium levels.</seg>

<seg id="671">Zoledronic acid is a representative of a substance called bisphosphonates and is used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, osteoporosis in men and the Paget's disease.</seg>
<seg id="672">Decreasing blood levels of sex hormones, especially estrogens formed from androgens, play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in males.</seg>
<seg id="673">At the Paget's Paget bone structure takes place too fast, and new bone material is constructed unordered, which makes the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta works by normalising the bone structure, ensuring normal bone formation and thus gives the bone strength again.</seg>
<seg id="675">If you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery, inform your doctor that you are treated with Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="676">If you use Aclerxes with other medicines, please inform your doctor, pharmacist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have been taken / used recently, even if it is not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="677">For your doctor, it is especially important to know if you are taking medicines, known from which it is known to damage the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="678">When using Aclasta, along with food and drinks, worry that you take sufficient fluid in accordance with your doctor's instructions before and after treatment with Aclasta.</seg>

<seg id="680">If you have recently broken the hip, it is recommended to take the administration of Aclerxes two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="681">The usual dose is 5 mg, which is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as infusion in a vein.</seg>
<seg id="682">Since Aclasta is working for a long time, you may need another dose only after a year or longer.</seg>
<seg id="683">It is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium mirror in your blood is not too low in time after infusion.</seg>
<seg id="684">With Morbus Paget, Aclasta can work longer than a year, and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="685">If the administration of Aclerxes was missed, contact your doctor or hospital promptly to arrange a new appointment.</seg>
<seg id="686">Before ending treatment with Aclerxes If you consider the end of treatment with Aclerxes, please take your next doctor's appointment and discuss this with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="687">Side effects associated with the first infusion are very common (with more than 30% of patients), but less frequent after the subsequent infusions.</seg>
<seg id="688">Fever and chills, muscular or joint pain and headache occur within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="689">Currently it is unclear if Aclerxes causes this irregular heartbeat, but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have received Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="690">Physical signs because of too low calcium- concentration in the blood, such as muscle cramps or tingling or numb feeling, especially in the area around the mouth.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be applied alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially obese patients) where metformin (a diabetes drug) is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be additionally applied to metformin in patients (especially obese patients), which can not be satisfactorily adjusted with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulphonic acid or insulin, the current dose of the sulphonic acid or insulin can be retained with the beginning of the account treatment except in patients with hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar); here, the dose of sulphonic acid or insulin is reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar levels are sinking, allowing type-2 diabetes to be better adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of actos in tripletherapy was studied; the patients received a combination of metformin with sulphonic acid, in addition they received either actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated haemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos resulted in lowering the HbA1c value, suggesting that blood glucose levels were lowered by 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg doses.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the Tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional administration of actos for the existing treatment with metformin and a sulphonic acid in lowering HbA1c values decreased by 0.94%, while the additional administration of placebo resulted in a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin was studied in 289 patients, the patients who took Actos in addition to insulin declined to decrease HbA1c values from 0,69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in patients who additionally took placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were visual dysfunctions, infections of the upper respiratory tract (colds), weight gain and hypothermic (decreased sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or one of the other constituents, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone mirror - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin for patients in which metformis is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission issued Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited a permit for the marketing of Actos across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">"" "the tablets are white until whitish, round, curved and carry on one side the marking" "" "15" "" "and on the other side the wording" "" "ACTOS" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and is unsuitable for metformin due to contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">No data is available for the use of pioglitazon in patients under 18 years of age, so the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are endangered through the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. former heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the physician should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular Outcome study with pioglitazone in patients less than 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in reports on heart failure, which, however, did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver enzymes (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, pioglitazon may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If ALT mirrors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range, the liver enzymes are to be monitored again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that point to a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, overbauchare, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzymes are checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of the patient is continued with Pioglitazon should be directed to the clinical assessment of the laboratory parameters.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with pioglitazon, a dose-dependent weight gain has been demonstrated, which may derive from fat deposits and in some cases linked to a fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of hemodilution, a minor reduction of mean haemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and haematocrit (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred under the therapy with Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pioglitazone in patients with metformin (relative reduction in hemoglobin by 3-4% and haematocries by 3,6-4.1%) and a lower degree also in patients with sulfonyl harnine and insulin (relative reduction in haemoglobin by 1-2% and haematocries by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive Pioglitazon as oral two-way or triple-combination therapy with insulin, the risk of dose-dependent hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, the treatment with Thiazolidindions, including pioglitazon, was reported about a occurrence or worsening of diabetic macular edema with a reduction of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct link between the intake of pioglitazon and the occurrence of macular edema, but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of macular edema if patients report abnormalities of visual acuity; an appropriate ophthalmologic examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summarizing analysis of adverse events concerning fractures from randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazon</seg>
<seg id="782">Fracture incidence was 1.9 Fraktur for each 100 patient years in the women and 1,1 fractures treated with pioglitazon in women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of more than 3.5 years investigating cardiovascular events, fractures performed at 44 / 870 (5,1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) treated with pioglitazon compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy and if a patient desires a pregnancy or that occurs, the treatment is to be terminated (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies investigating the interactions have shown that pioglitazon does not exercise any relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmacogenicity of digoxine, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporin, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA-reduction inhibitors are not to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase of the AUC from Pioglitazon by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a reduction in the AUC from Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that in the treatment with pioglitazone the hyperinsulinemia resulting in pregnancy is reduced and increased insulin resistance of the mother's tieres diminished, thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very often &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (not estimated from this data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turbine and the fraction of the lens, as observed in other hypoglycemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with pioglitazon, ALT climbs higher than three times the upper limit of the standard range as well as placebo, but more rarely than in comparison groups under metformin or sulphonic acid.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study in patients with advanced macrovascular disease, the incidence of severe heart failure under Pioglitazon was 1.6% higher than placebo when Pioglitazon resp.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch, insufficiency was rarely reported in pioglitazon, but more often when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summarizing analysis of adverse events concerning fractures from randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazon treated groups and over 7,400 patients in the groups treated with comparative mediation.</seg>
<seg id="796">During the trial period of 3.5 years, fractures performed at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazon compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days, no symptoms occurred.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to have an activation of specific nuclear receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator activated Receptor-γ (PPAR-γ)) which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver, grease and skeletal muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces glucosamine production in the liver and improves the peripheral glucoseversion in the event of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical trial with pioglitazon versus Gliclazide as monotherapy has been continued over two years to study the time until after the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the beginning of the therapy, a blood cell control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) was maintained by Pioglitazon in 69% of the patients treated (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclacid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was inadequate despite three months of optimization with insulin, were randomised to pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazon the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared to the patients receiving only insulin; a reduction in insulin doses in the group treated with pioglitazon was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical studies over a year, under Pioglitazon, a statistically significant decrease in albumin / creatinin quotients was compared to the baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18-week examination of type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials compared to placebo, a reduction of the total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol as well as slightly, however clinically not significantly increased LDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical studies over a period of up to two years, pioglitazone reduced overall plasticlerides and free fatty acids compared to placebo, metformin or gliclazide and increased HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, there was no statistically significant increase in LDL Cholesterinspiegel in Pioglitazon, whereas measured values were observed under metformin and gliclacid.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study over 20 weeks, Pioglitazon reduced not only the triglycerides, but also improved triglyceride levels, both with an effect on triglycerid absorption and hepatic triglycerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular Outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease were randomised in groups over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to already existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular treatment either pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazon is quickly absorbed, whereby the peak concentrations of unmodified pioglitazon in plasma usually reach 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV corresponds to the efficacy in about three times the efficacy of pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, it could be proven that Pioglitazon exerts no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacogenicity of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) or with rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8-inductor) or lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazon (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">According to oral application of radioactive marketed pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in the field (55%) and a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma elimination period of unchanged pioglitazone amounts to 5-6 hours in humans and the total active metabolites is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of Pioglitazon and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced renal function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of the oral clearance of the parent substance resemble.</seg>
<seg id="818">Toxicological studies occurred in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys after repeated administration plasma volume increase with hemodilution, anemia and reversible eccentric cardiac hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that under treatment with pioglitazone the hyperinsulinemia resulting in the gestation decreases and increases the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidences of hyperplasia (male and female rats) and tumors (in male rats) were induced by the urinary bladder epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP), the treatment with two other Thiazolidindions led to an increased frequency of colder pores.</seg>

<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of more than 3.5 years investigating cardiovascular events, fractures performed at 44 / 870 (5,1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) treated with pioglitazon compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In a further study over two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with pioglitazon or gliclazide were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical studies over one year, under Pioglitazon, a statistically significant decrease in albumin / creatinin quotients was compared to the baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study over 20 weeks, Pioglitazon reduced not only the intimidated triglycerides but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride levels, both with an effect on the triglycerid absorption and hepatic tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was the target of its primary endpoint, which resulted in a combination of total mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankle, coronary vascularization and vascularization of the leg arteries, the results suggest that with the intake of pioglitazon there are no cardiovascular long-term risks.</seg>

<seg id="866">Actaphane led to a decrease in the HbA1c mirror suggesting that blood sugar levels were lowered similar to that of another human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actaphane should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to human insulin (rDNA) or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">Also, the dosages of Actaphan may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar (the complete list is to be found in the treatment plant).</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Actaphane were outweighed in the treatment of diabetes against the risks.</seg>
<seg id="870">In October 2002, the European Commission issued a permit for the company Novo Nordisk A / S for the marketing of Actraphans throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Premixed insulin products are usually used once or twice a day if a rapid initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose is injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood sugar levels have improved significantly for example by intensified insulin therapy, can change the hypoglycaemia warning symptoms and should therefore be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change regarding strength, brand (manufacturers), insulin type (fast acting, biphaseal, long acting insulin, etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin or insulin analog) and / or manufacturing method (by recombinant DNA toward insulin of animal origin) can cause a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="875">If a dose is required when switching to Actraphane in the patient, it may be necessary for the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients with hypoglycemic reactions occurred after a change from animal to human insulin, reported that the early symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or unlike their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Before travelling over several time zones, the patient should be advised to obtain the advice of his doctor as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor must therefore take into account possible interactions during the therapy and ask his patients to consult other medicines.</seg>
<seg id="879">4 Both hypoglycaemia as well as hyperglycemia, which can occur in a not sufficiently controlled diabetestherapy, increase the risk of abnormalities and fertility in utero.</seg>
<seg id="880">Severe hypoglycemias can lead to unconsciousness and / or seizures and end with temporary or permanent disorders of the brain function and even death.</seg>
<seg id="881">Diseases of the nervous system - Periphere Neuropathy A rapid recovery of the blood cell control can be associated with complaints which are referred to as acute painful neuropathy and are usually reversible.</seg>
<seg id="882">5 An intensification of insulin therapy with an abrupt improvement of blood sugar can however be associated with a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy.</seg>
<seg id="883">Skin and skin tissue diseases - Lipodystrophy An the injection site may develop a lipodystrophy if foamed to change the incisions within the injection area.</seg>
<seg id="884">General conditions and complaints at the site Gelegnal - Local hypersensitivity reaction at the injection site During the insulin therapy, local hypersensitivity reactions (redness, swelling, itching, pain and hematoma occur at the injection site) occur.</seg>
<seg id="885">Diseases of the immune system - Urticaria, Exanthem Very rare - anaphylactic reactions symptoms of generalized hypersensitivity, including generalized skin rash, itching, sweating, gastrointestinal disorders, angiotic edema, breathing difficulties, heart palpitations, low blood pressure and impotence / unconsciousness.</seg>
<seg id="886">Hypoglycemia can however be gradually developed: • Easy hypoglycemia can be treated by the oral feed of glucose and sugary foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should therefore always have grape sugars, sweets, biscuits, or sugar-containing fruit juice. • Heavy hypoglycemia with unconsciousness are treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by a designated aid doctor or by glucose which is given intravenously by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect begins within half an hour, the active maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration is up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The absorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of fissures (hydrolysis) places on the human insulin molecular were considered; none of the metabolites formed by the cleavage are active.</seg>
<seg id="891">Based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated use, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data cannot detect any particular hazards for humans.</seg>
<seg id="892">It is recommended - after the Actaphone Cutout Bottle from the fridge is taken - the temperature of insulin at room temperature (not exceeding 25 ° C) is allowed before it is eaten according to the operating instructions for the first use.</seg>
<seg id="893">Some patients with hypoglycemic reactions occurred after a change from animal to human insulin, reported that the early symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or unlike their previous insulin.</seg>

<seg id="896">13 An intensification of insulin therapy with an abrupt improvement of blood sugar can however be associated with a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy.</seg>
<seg id="897">The terminal half-life time (t ½) is therefore rather a measure of resorption as a measure of elimination by se of the insulin from the plasma (insulin has a t ½ of just a few minutes).</seg>

<seg id="1170">The medicine is not recommended for children and for patients who had an organ transplant, as it was not examined for these groups.</seg>
<seg id="1171">In the first study, in which 1 072 patients participated, the efficacy of three different Adenuric doses (once daily 80, 120 and 240 mg) was compared with the placebo (pseudo drug) and Allopurinol (another medicine for the treatment of hyperuricemia).</seg>
<seg id="1172">In the second study two dosages of Adenuric (once daily 80 and 120 mg) were compared to 762 patients each with Allopurinol.</seg>
<seg id="1173">In both studies Allopurinol was used in a dose of once daily 300 mg; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg a day.</seg>
<seg id="1174">The main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients whose uric acid levels were in the blood during the last three measurements below 6 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1175">In the first study 48% (126 of 262) of patients receiving Adenuric in a dose of once daily 80 mg, and 65% (175 of 269) of patients who once daily received 120 mg, in the last three measurements a uric acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1176">Compared to this, this was 22% (60 of 268) of patients with Allopurinol and in none of the 134 patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1177">The most common side effects of Adenuric (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea, nausea (nausea), rash and abnormal liver values.</seg>
<seg id="1178">In particular in patients with heart defects in prehistory, there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1179">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) reached the conclusion that Adenuric was more effective in lowering the uric acid level in the blood than allopurinol, but there could also be a higher risk of side-effects related to the heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1180">Treatment of chronic hyperuricemia in diseases that have already led to uranium deposits (including one from the medical history known or currently available gout node and / or arthritis).</seg>
<seg id="1181">If the serum uric acid levels after 2-4 weeks still &gt; 6 mg / dl (357 µmol / l), a can increase on ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily can be taken into consideration.</seg>
<seg id="1182">In patients with severe kidney function restriction, efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated (Kreatinin- clearance &lt; 30 ml / min, see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1183">Children and adolescents since there are no experiences in children and adolescents, the use of Feburuxostat is not recommended in this patient group.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Transplant Transplanters Since there are no experiences with organ transplant recipients, the use of Feburuxostat in this patient group is not recommended (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1185">Cardiovascular disease In patients with ischemic heart disease or compensated cardiac insufficiency, the treatment with Feburuxostat is not recommended (see section 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="1188">Liver disease during phase 3 clinical studies were observed slight abnormalities of liver function values in patients treated with February (3.5%).</seg>
<seg id="1189">It is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test prior to the beginning of the February and subsequent treatment (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1190">Theophylline Zwar has not been carried out expositional studies on Feburveda, but it is known that the XO inhibiting may lead to an increase in theophylline mirror (a inhibition of the metabolism of theophyllin was also reported for other XO inhibitors).</seg>
<seg id="1191">In subjects, the simultaneous administration of Feburuxostat and naproxen was 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in February 2008 exposure (CMAx 28%, AUC 41% and t1 / 2 26%).</seg>
<seg id="1192">In clinical studies the application of naproxen or other NSAR / Cox-2 inhibitors was not associated with a clinically significant increase in adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Colchicin / Indometacin / Hydrochlorothazide / Warfarin Febuxostat can be used together with Colchicin or Indometacin, without requiring a dose adjustment for Feburveda or the simultaneously applied other active ingredient.</seg>

<seg id="1195">Antazida It could be shown that the simultaneous use of an antacid, which contains magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide, slowed the absorption of Feburuxostat (about 1 hour) and a drop in CMAx by 32%, but no significant change in AUC causes.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregnancy outcomes do not allow any side effects from Feburveda to pregnancy or the health of fetus / newborns.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development or birth (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="1198">Patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle, serving machines or performing dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that ADENURIC does not adversely affect their performance.</seg>
<seg id="1199">A numerically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported in the Gesamtfebuxostatgruppe compared to the Allopurinol group was observed in the pivotal study of phase 3 (1,3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years), although no statistically significant differences were found and no causal connection with Febrauostat could be detected.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The risk factors determined in these patients were an arteriosclerosis disease and / or a myocardial infarction or a decompensation of heart failure in the medical history.</seg>
<seg id="1201">Frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100) and rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000) side effects, which could occur in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of February and which were reported more than once in all February 2008 treatment groups, are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting are more common in patients treated with colchicin. * * In clinical studies no serious rashes or severe hypersensitivity reactions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1203">7 Open long-term extension studies In the open long-term extension studies 906 patients were treated for up to 1 year, 322 patients up to 2 years, 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with Feburuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1204">The events-related events reported during long-term studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies (see Table 1).</seg>
<seg id="1205">The following treatment-related events were reported more than once in all February treatment groups and occurred in patients who received Feburuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg. in long-term extension studies (up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,900 patient-years), according to the information occasionally.</seg>
<seg id="1206">The following treatment-related events were either not reported in the pivotal studies of phase 3 for these cans or with a lower frequency:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Diabetes, hyperlipidemia, insomnia, hypaesthesia, conspicuous ECG, cough, shortness, skin discoloration, skin lesions, bursitis, protein urie, renal insufficiency, erectile dysfunction, increase in concentrations in the blood, decline of the lymphocyte number, decline in the number of white blood cells.</seg>

<seg id="1210">Clinical study results The efficacy of ADENURIC was shown in two pivotal studies of phase 3 (APEX study and FACT study as described below), which were performed with 1.832 patients with hyperurikaemia and gout.</seg>
<seg id="1211">The primary efficacy endpoint was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three month specific serum harnsage levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) were.</seg>

<seg id="1219">DENURIC was the primary efficacy endpoint at 44% (80 mg 1 x daily), 45% (120 mg 1 x daily) and 60% (240 mg 1 x daily) of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1220">There were no clinically significant differences regarding the percentage decline of serum-acid concentrations in subjects, regardless of kidney function (58% in group with normal kidney function and 55% in the group with severe kidney function).</seg>
<seg id="1221">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with serum-acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl about 40% of the patients (APEX- and FACT study) had a serum-acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the start of study (Baseline).</seg>
<seg id="1222">The data gathered in two years of the open extension study of phase 3 showed that the permanent lowering of the serum uric acid level to &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of gypsum attacks, so that less than 3% of the patients needed a treatment against a gypsum (i.e. more than 97% of patients needed no treatment against a gypsum).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in the gland size, which resulted in 54% of patients a complete disappearance of the gout nodes by month 24.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Increased TSH- values (&gt; 5.5 µY / ml) were observed in patients who received a long-term treatment with Feburuxostat (5.0%) and also in patients receiving Allopurinol (5.8%) in the open long-term extension studies (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy subjects increased the maximum plasma concentrations (CMAx) and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from Feburuxostat after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose-proportional.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For doses of between 120 mg and 300 mg, an increase in AUC is observed for Feburuxostat, which is greater than the dose-proportional increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily, the CMAx is about 2.8-3.2 µg / ml and 5.0-5.3 µg / ml.</seg>

<seg id="1277">To avoid irritation of the oesophagus, the patient may not lie down until after the first food intake of the day, which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Since Aldatronat and vitamin D3 are already used separately in drugs approved in the European Union, the Company presented data that originate from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study of 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in order to prove the efficacy of ADROVANCE regarding the increase in vitamin D spasel.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15-week treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels was lower (11%) compared to those treated with alkaline (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also presented data that suggests that the Aldatronat dose contained in ADROVANCE is exactly the dose that is needed to prevent bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are headaches, pain of the musculoskeletal system (muscles, bones or joints), and symptoms of the digestive apparatus, such as abdominal pain, dyspepsia (diarrhoea), flatulence (flatulence), flatulence (flatulence), irritated abdomen (belted abdomen) as well as acid elevations.</seg>
<seg id="1283">ADROVANCE must not be used in patients with moderate hypersensitivity (allergy) against alendronate, vitamin D3 or one of the other components.</seg>

<seg id="1288">The following indications are to be followed exactly to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and related side effects (see section 4.4):</seg>
<seg id="1289">• ADROVANCE should be swallowed after the day only with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml). • The patients should not chew the tablet or put the tablet in the mouth, since there is a risk for oropharyngeal ulcerine.</seg>
<seg id="1290">B. peptic ulcer, active gastrointestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper Gastrointestinal tract except pyloroplasty, can be given only under special caution (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1291">Esophageal reactions, such as esophageal ulcerations, esophageal ulcerations, and esophageal erosions, rarely followed by esophageal fractures, were reported in patients taking alendronat (partially these were severe and required a hospital briefing).</seg>

<seg id="1293">3 The risk of severe evophageal side effects appears to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that refer to esophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While in large-scale clinical trials with alendronat no increased risk was found, rare (after market launch) stomach and duodenal ulcera, including some severe and with complications, were reported (see section 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="1301">Other diseases affecting the mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyreoidism) should also be treated adequately before the start of therapy with ADROVANCE.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Alkaline foods and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicines can impair the absorption of alkaline when taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Therefore patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking alurronat before taking other medicines (see Sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interaction studies were not performed, Alendronat was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines, without clinically relevant interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is only intended for use in postmenopausal women and is therefore not to be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding women.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and the treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus, this can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects including under- or immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; changes in the formulation or regime should only be carried out under the close-meshed control of a physician experienced in the transplant (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of a switch to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases and on blood level regulations (see below "Recommendations")</seg>
<seg id="1415">After conversion from Prograf to Advagraf, the Tacrolimus Talking should be checked before switching and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4 the systemic exposition, measured as a valley mirror, was comparable with both formulations in both kidney and liver transplants.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated checks of the Tacrolimus Talking are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advagraf to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate transplant phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since Tacrolimus is a substance with low clearance, an adjustment of the Advagraf can take several days before Steady State is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1428">Can be adjusted in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function. in patients with severe liver dysfunction, a reduction of the dose may be required in patients with severe liver dysfunction.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced renal function Since the renal function exerts no influence on the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that dosage adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">However, due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular determination of serum creatine inspiegel, calculation of the creatine integrity and a monitoring of the urine volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Conversion from Ciclosporin to Advagraf In the conversion from one Ciclosporto to a Tacrolimus-based therapy caution is advisable (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations on the level of sebum in full blood The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of repulsion and tolerability in the individual case under the aid of full blood Tacrolimus Talking Controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent checks of the Tacrolimus Talking during the first two weeks after transplantation followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-Talking of Tacrolimus should also be controlled after conversion from Prograf to Advagraf, dosage adjustment, changes of immunosuppressive therapy or while applying substances that could change the Tacrolimus full blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a medicine with a low clearance, adaptations of the dose may require several days until Steady State has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the levels in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the blood level of tacrolimus in the whole blood in the first time after liver transplantation is usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml, and cardiac transplants in 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and cardiac transplant receptors, blood concentrations were usually used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This led to serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects, which can occur as a result of tacrolimus under- or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; changes in the formulation or regime should only be carried out under the close-meshed control of a physician experienced in the transplant (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="1442">For prophylaxis of transplant rejection in adult heart transplant receptors and transplant receptors in childhood, no clinical data is still present for the retarded formulation of Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions that may lead to a reduction of the tacrolimus levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements, the Johanniskraut (Hypericum perforatum), is to avoid other plant remedies during treatment with Advagraf (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is offered, as the Tacrolimus blood levels can be subjected to considerable fluctuations under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases a hypertrophy called Lyme cardiomyopathy was observed under Prograf, which can therefore also occur under Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, hypertension, kidney or liver dysfunctions, infections, liquid overload and oedema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, the exposure of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malignant skin changes due to suitable clothes or use of a sun protection device with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who take Tacrolimus, symptoms for PRES like headaches, altered state of consciousness, cramps and vision disturbances should show a radiological examination (e.g.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can influence the metabolism of tacrolimus and consequently increase or lower the blood values of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore advisable to monitor the Tacrolimus blood levels while offering substances that can change the CYP3A metabolism, and adjust the Tacrolimus dose to maintain constant concentrations according to (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly pronounced reciprocal effect was made with antimycotics such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole and with the Macroid-antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z.</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the increase in blood levels mainly resulted from the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus, caused by the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">High-dose prednisolone or methylprednisolone, as used in acute repulsion reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other drugs called Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibition; therefore, the simultaneous application of tacrolimus with drugs that are metabolized by CYP3A4 can affect their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">As tacrolimus reduce the clearance of steroid contraceptive pills and thus increase hormone exposure, decisions on contraceptive measures should be particularly cautious.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal tests have shown that Tacrolimus can potentially reduce the clearance of pentobarbital and phenazone and can prolong their half-value.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a low number of transplant patients do not indicate that under Tacrolimus in comparison to other immunosuppressants, there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In the case of utero exposure, a monitoring of the newborn is recommended for possible harmful effects of tacrolimus (especially regarding its effect on the kidneys).</seg>

<seg id="1466">Cases of BK-Virus-associated Nephropathy and JC-Virus-associated progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy (PML) were reported in patients with immunosuppression therapy, including therapy with Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1467">It was reported about benign or malignant neoplasm including EBV-associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumors associated with the treatment of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and the high binding of erythrocytes and plasma proteins, it can be assumed that Tacrolimus is not dialysis.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Active mechanisms and pharmacodynamic effects on a molecular level are likely to mediate the effects of tacrolimus through its binding to a cytosolical protein (FKBP12) which is responsible for enrichment of the connection in the cellular memory.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This results in a calciumdependent inhibition of signalling pathways in the T cell and thus prevents transcription of a certain number of lymphokin genes.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Tacrolimus suppresses the activation of the T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on the T-helper cells (like Interleukin-2, Interleukin-3 and γ-interferon) and the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor.</seg>

<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematocrit and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the sinless fraction of tacrolimus, or a higher clearing of metabolism should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that Tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, whereby the excretion occurs mainly via the bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In stable patients who were moved from Prograf (twice daily) to Advagraf (once daily) in relation to 1: 1 (mg: mg) relative to the total dose dose, systemic exposure of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) was approximately 10% lower than Prograf.</seg>

<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application are based on whether advocates are used to treat bleeding or preventing bleeding in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII defect, causing bleeding problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but is produced by a method called "recombinant DNA technology."</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, CHMP continues to evaluate the benefits risk weighing as positive, but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore CHMP has decided on the basis of the safety profile of ADVATE, which necessitates a filing of PSURs every 6 months, decided to apply for a further extension procedure within 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited has officially distributed CHMP's Committee for Human Use (CHMP) that the company withdraws its application for approval of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni Cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the tissues (tissues that connects other structures in the body, surrounds and supports) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified to carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">"" "the virus in Advexin is a" "" "Adenovirus" "", "which has been modified to produce no copies of itself and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans." ""</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advocate would have been injected directly into the tumors and thus enable cancer cells to rebuild the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is formed from the non-defective p53 gene in the human body, usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and killing the cells when DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In Li-Fraumeni-Cancer, where the p53-gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient in which Li-Fraumeni-cancer occurred in the field of undermining, bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had checked the answers from the company to the questions he asked, some questions were still unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the review of the initial documents submitted, CHMP will create a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to CHMP, it was not sufficiently proven that the injection of Advexin in Li-Fraumeni-Tumore brings benefits to patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company has not sufficiently proven that Advexin can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is not harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not know CHMP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical studies or "compassionate Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "modified drug release" "" "means that the tablets are so combined that one of the effective ingredients will be released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nasal pathways caused by pollen) in patients with nasal mucosa (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents aged 12 and over, the recommended dose of aerina twice daily is a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated once the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are abbreviated.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended, because the effects of the drug can be traced to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measurements were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">When considering all hay fever symptoms in addition to constipation of the nose, patients who participated in the aerinaze reported a decrease in symptoms by 46.0%, compared to 35.9% in patients receiving pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was observed, the patients showed an alleviation of symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients who used Desloratadine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerinaze (observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia (cardiac disease), ceryngitis (restlessness), anorexia (loss of appetite), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolence (sleepiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Intoxins may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Desloratadine, pseudoephedrine or one of the other ingredients, against adrenergic agents or lauatadine (other medicines for treating allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure), cardiac or vascular diseases including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyrosis (hypertension caused by the thyroid) or have a risk of haemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">"" "" "" "on 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the SP Europe European Commission to transport Aerinaze across the European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water but is swallowed as a whole (i.e. without breaking it, crush or chew it).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Due to the lack of data on insecurity and effectiveness (see section 5.1), aerinaze should not be applied to children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued following symptoms of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the duration of use to 10 days, as long-term application the activity of pseudoephedrine can decrease with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After a decrease in the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory passages, the treatment can be continued with Desloratadine as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze Pseudoephedrine contains, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or within 2 weeks after the end of such treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphamean activity in combined application of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocripitin, pergolid, gourid, cabinetolin, ergotamine, dihydrocarbazine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, Naphazolin etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient group and the data do not suffice to pronounce corresponding recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and effectiveness of ininaze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction, and the data do not suffice to pronounce corresponding recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that the treatment in the occurrence of hypertension or a tachycardia or of paddons, heart rhythms, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headache or a strengthening of the headache) must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients with cardiac arrhythmia • Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder neck or bronchospasm in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is at least 48 hours before performing dermatological tests, since antihistamines can otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or to reduce it to their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical trials with Desloratadin, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally given, no clinically relevant interactions or alterations of the plasma concentration of Desloratadine were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with Desloratadine and the patients treated with placebo, regardless of whether Desloratadin alone or with alcohol was taken.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadine was not yet identified so that interactions with other medicines could not be completely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin inhibits in-vivo CYP3A4 not, and in vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins is.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The intoxicality of the application of aerina during pregnancy is not assured, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies however did not increase the frequency of abnormalities compared to frequency with the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies do not always be transmitted to humans and on the basis of the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, aerinaze should not be used during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases, it may result in a dizziness that may result in impairment of the traffic tightness or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, reduced mental attention, cyanose, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and a CNS stimulation (sleeplessness, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible letterings.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headaches, anxiety, aggravated mition, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, breath insufficiency, heart rhythms, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, transpiration, nausea, vomiting, precordial pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, vision disturbances and hypertension or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as atropine-typical symptoms (mouth-dryness, pupil-starre and - dilatation, skin redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include inhibition of suspension of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as inhibition of the expression of the P-selectin hormone molecule on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadine 5 mg did not affect the standard measurement parameters of the fluid flow, including the amplification of subjective glacidity or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical studies, there was no increased frequency of sleepiness compared to placebo daily at the recommended dosage of 5 mg. a day.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause other likeable effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachycardia or manifestation of a CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Herceptin has taken 1,248 patients between 12 and 78 years of seasonal and allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving aeronary tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, the histamine antagonistic effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal mucosa, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with Desloratadine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of ininaze tablets showed no significant difference in terms of sex, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">In the context of a single dose study on the pharmacokinetics of aerinaze, Desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes after administration.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aerinaze in healthy subjects over 14 days, the fluid balance of Desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">Within the scope of a pharmacokinetic multiple dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult subjects, it has been noted that four promoters Desloratadin were poorly metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that exposure (CMAx and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the allround administration of pseudoephedrine was bible for exposure to the gift of an Aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with Desloratadine does not reveal any particular hazards to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination possessed no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally related to the substance pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductionstoxicological studies the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">March 2007 and in Module 1.8.1 of the application application, the pharmacovivigilance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>

<seg id="1738">In a clinical trial with 578 adolescent patients aged 12 to 17, the most common side effect was headache, with 5.9% of patients treated with Desloratadine and 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multi-dose study that was administered up to 45 mg of Desloratadin (ninety clinical dose), no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes inhibition of suspension of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as inhibition of the expression of the P-selectin in endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">As part of a clinical study with multiple doses, in which Desloratadin was administered up to 20 mg daily over 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinically pharmacological study, in the Desloratadin in a dose of 45 mg a day (the nine times the clinical dose) was administered over ten days, no extension of the Qtc intervall showed itself.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadine 5 mg did not affect the standard measurement parameters of the fluid flow, including the amplification of subjective glacidity or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in alleviating symptoms such as Niesen, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tear and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can alternatively be divided in intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">An allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown on the overall cores of the questionnaire's quality of life at Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively diminishes the strain caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Chronic diopathic urticaria was found on behalf of further forms of the Urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology, regardless of etiology, is similar in the different forms and can be easily recruited chronically.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since histamine replacement is a causative factor in all urticular disorders, Desloratadin is also expected to improve the symptoms in other forms of the Urticaria in other forms of the Urticaria; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic diopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving Pruritus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, the minority of patients who did not react to antihistamines were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improvement of the itchiness by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with Desloratadine compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius significantly reduced the disturbance of sleep and vigour, as measured by a 4-point scale to evaluate these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, in which patients were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of patients had a higher concentration of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no clues for clinically relevant cumulation after daily application of Desloratadine (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratad has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines will not be completely eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin inhibits in-vivo not CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 is not inhibited and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins is.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study with Desloratadin in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, calorie rich breakfast) were not based on the availability of Desloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The preclinical studies carried out with Desloratadin and Loratad showed no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding the risk profile of Desloratadin and Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with Desloratadine cannot detect any special hazards for humans.</seg>
<seg id="1762">Colorfull film (contains lactose monohydrate, hypromellose, titanium dioxide, Macrogol 400, Indigocarmin (E 132)), colourless film (contains hypromellose, Macrogol 400), Carnauba wax, bleached wax.</seg>
<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of meals to alleviate symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and Urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by infection (see section 4.4) and that no data are available that support a treatment of infectious rhinitis associated with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion from upper respiratory infections or anatomical anomalies, the anamnesis, physical examinations and corresponding laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabolize Desloratadine and experience a higher level of substance (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius Sirup in children between 2 and 11 years who are fully metabolized is identical to that with children who metabolise normal.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This drug contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose absorption or a sucrose isomaltase- insufficiency of this drug should not take.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Aerius tablets, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical pharmacological study, while taking Aerius tablets and alcohol, the performance-reducing effect of alcohol was not amplified (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 was similar to the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical studies involving adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic diopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events were reported in patients with Aerius than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">In a multi-dose study of adults and adolescents, at which up to 45 mg of Desloratadin (ninety clinical dosage) administered, no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children between 1 and 11 years of age who were eligible for antihistamine therapy received a daily diloratadindose of 1.25 mg (aged between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of Desloratadin are similar in adults and children, the efficacy data of Desloratadine in adults can be extrapolated to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">As part of a clinical trial with multiple doses of adults and adolescents, in the Desloratadin in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinically pharmacological study of adults and adolescents, in the Desloratadin population in a dose of 45 mg a day (the nine times the clinical dosage) was applied over ten days in adults, no extension of the Qtc intervall showed itself.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical studies, at the recommended dosage of 5 mg a day for adults and adolescents there was no increased frequency of sleepiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1779">In a single daily dose of 7.5 mg, Aerius tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical studies did not disturb the psychomotor.</seg>
<seg id="1780">In clinical pharmacological studies in adults, the simultaneous use of alcohol neither increased alcohol induced loss of impairment nor an increase in drowsiness.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adults and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in alleviating symptoms such as Niesen, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tear and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As shown on the overall cores of the questionnaire's quality of life at Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius tablets effectively diminish the caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic diopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving Pruritus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The spread of this limited metabolic phenotype was similar to adults (6%) and children from 2 to 11 years (6%) and in both populations greater in black (18% adults, 16% children) than with chewing (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multiple-dose study with the sipping of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis, which are fully metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1786">The load (AUC) by Desloratadin was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the CMAx was approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half-time of about 120 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1787">There are no clues for a clinically relevant drug addiction once daily application of Desloratadine (5- 20 mg) over 14 days in adults and adolescents.</seg>
<seg id="1788">12 In various single dose studies, AUC- and CMAx values of Desloratadin were compared with pediatric patients in the recommended doses, with those of adults who received the Desloratadine syrup in a dosage of 5 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1789">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadine was not yet identified so that interactions with other medicines could not be completely excluded.</seg>

<seg id="1886">After market launch of Aerius, very rare cases of severe allergic reactions (difficulties in breathing, whistling breathing, itching, hives and swelling) and rashes were reported.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Aerius solution for boarding is indicated for children between 1 and 11 years, adolescents (12 years and older) and adults, older people included.</seg>
<seg id="1888">If the solution for taking an application syringe for preparations to take with scaling, you can use it alternatively to take the appropriate amount of solution to take.</seg>
<seg id="1889">In terms of treatment duration, your doctor will find the type of allergic rhinitis among which you suffer and will determine how long you should take Aerius solution for taking.</seg>
<seg id="1890">However, in children under 2 years of diarrhoea, fever and sleeplessness were frequent side-effects during adults fatigue, mouth-dryness and headache were reported more often than with placebo.</seg>

<seg id="1893">June 2008 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. officially distributed CHMP's Committee for Human Use (CHMP) that the company withdraws its application for approval of Aflunov to prevent the aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and older people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used to protect against influenza caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the Influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic emerges when a new strain of the flu virus appears, which can easily spread from human to human because people have not built immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system detects the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system will later be able to establish a rapid antibody in contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Afterwards, the membrane of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which detects the human body as a body foreign), has been disconnected and used as a constituent of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"" "a survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was conducted not according to the" "" "good clinical practice" "" "(GCP)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for pandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Should you take part in a clinical trial and require more information about your treatment, please contact your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you would like more information on the basis of CHMP's recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also included in the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines to treat adults and children over four years, which are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenase is available as a solution for intake, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir as the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Aginase should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked what antiviral medicines the patient has previously taken, and the likelihood has assessed the virus to respond to the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg Ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of aggenase depends on the body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Anagenase decreases the HIV amount in the blood while taking in combination with other antiviral medicines and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS is not cure, but can postpone damage to the immune system and thereby the development of infections and disorders associated with AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenase was studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, in two major studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">It was compared to other proteasinhibitors with 206 adults who formerly occupied Proteasehemms with low dosed Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of the efficacy was the percentage of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the modification of the viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies involving patients who had previously not taken a protease inhibitor, after 48 weeks in Agenase, more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml than placebo, but Agenase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenase also reduced the last virus load, but with the children formerly treated with protease inhibitors, very few responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who were formerly treated with proteasinhibitors, the pharynus load increased with Ritonavir after 16-week treatment just as effective as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, Agenase together with Ritonavir came to a stronger drop in the viral load after four weeks as with the patients who continued their former protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of agglomerate (observed with more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhoea), flatulence (flatulence), nausea (nausea), vomiting, skin rash and fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 ingenase may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amprenavir or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Aginase may not be used in patients, the Johanniskraut (herbal supplement for treating depression) or medicines that are degraded as well as greenhouse gases and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV there is a risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), a osteonecrose (loss of bone tissue) or an immune reaction syndrome (symptoms of an infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of agglomerate in combination with other antiretroviral medicines used to treat HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Genase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier of Ritonavir, but the committee noted that the benefit of agglomerate in combination with Ritonavir in patients who had previously not taken a protease inhibitor has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "vase was originally licensed under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "" "because only limited information is available at the time of approval for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission issued Glaxo Group Limited a permit for the transport of greenhouse gases across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Genase is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicines to treat HIV-1 infected, proteasinhibitors (PI) previously treated adults and children aged 4 and over.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually, Agenase capsules are to be administered to the pharmacokinetic padding of amprenavir along with low doses of Ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amprenavir should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre-treatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of amprenavir as a solution to take-up is 14% lower than from Amprenavir as capsule; therefore, anaerobic capsules and solution are not interchangeable on a milligram basis (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenase capsules is 600 mg of Amprenavir twice daily along with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 When Agenase capsules are used without the intensifying addition of Ritonavir (boosters), higher doses of agglomerate (1200 mg twice daily) must be used.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenase Capsules is 20 mg of Amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of agglomerate in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Aggenase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to the lack of data for harmlessness and effectiveness (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunctions to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The concurrent use should be done with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, they are contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Vgeneration must not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and are also substrates of the Cytochrome P450-Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Plant preparations containing Johanniskraut (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a diminished therapeutic effect of amprenavir during the intake of amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that anagenesis or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to curing the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy, including treatment with aginase, does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually, Agenase Capsules should be used together with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have increased risk of serious liver incidents with potentially fatal course.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing hepatitis showed an increased frequency of liver dysfunction under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous application of Agenase and Ritonavir with Fluticasone or other Glukokortioids, which are metabolized via CYP3A4, is not recommended unless the possible benefit of treatment outweighs systemic corticosteroidal effects including Morbus Cushing and repression of the adrenal function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolization of HMG-CoA-Reductase inhibitors Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, an simultaneous administration of asgenase with lovastatin and simvastatin is not recommended for the increased risk of myopathies including rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines which may cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International standardization ratio), are available methods for determining the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients taking this medicine at the same time, aggenase may be less effective because of decreased plasma levels of amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amprenavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives can be altered, however the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given with amprenavir at the same time, the patients should therefore be monitored on the symptoms of opium, especially if there are still low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the potential risk of toxicity caused by the high propylene glycolocoll of the Agenase solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Vase should be set to 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients receiving antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors were reported on the incidence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases to whose therapy medications were needed which are associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and with drug-dependent factors, such as a longer lasting antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disturbances associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Hämophilen patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors are reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous hematomas and haemorthrosis.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with serious immune defect, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections may develop at the time of initiating an anti-inflammatory or residual opportunistic infections that leads to severe clinical conditions or worsening symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although multifactorial ethology is accepted (including application of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher Body-Mass Index), cases of osteoarthritis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term use of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width are not allowed at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and are also substrates of the Cytochrome P450-Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenase with Ritonavir may not be combined with medicines whose active substances are mainly metabolized via CYP2D6 and are associated with serious and / or life-threatening side effects for the increased plasma torch.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC from Amprenavir, which can lead to a virological failure and a resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In trying to compensate the elevated plasma levels through a can increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, very often adverse effects were observed in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of amprenavir can be reduced by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">When a patient adopts Johanniskraut, the amprenatal level is and, if possible, check the viral load and suspend the Johanniskraut.</seg>
<seg id="1965">Dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required when nelfinavir is administered together with amprenavir (see also vanity below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increased, by contrast, reduced by 30% for CMAx when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical studies dosages of 600 mg of amprenavir were used twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, which prove the efficacy and harmlessness of this treatment regimen.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% reduced when amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) was given in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of amprenavir in plasma, which were achieved with the combination of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with calcium (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given, however, it is recommended a close monitoring since the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study carried out in combination with didansis in combination with Didanosin, however, due to the antacid component of Didanosin it is recommended that the income of didanosin and agglomeration are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dosage adjustment is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of nevirapin to other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggest that nevirapine might lower the serum concentration of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used at the same time, caution is advisable since Delavirine could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these drugs are used together, caution is advisable; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring is to be performed, as precise predictions of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and Ritonavir on Delavirine is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of amprenavir and rifabutin led to an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) of rifabutin by 193% and thus to an increase in side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer rifabutin together with ageneration, a reduction of the dosage of rifabutin is advised to at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data is available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with agglomerate in combination with erythromycin were not performed, however, the plasma levels of both drugs might be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous use of twice a day 700 mg of Fosamrenavir and 100 mg ketoconazole once daily resulted in an increase in the CMAx of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) compared to the value that was observed once daily without simultaneous use of Fosamrenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines which are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, may lead to interactions with Agenase.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions which are associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with vase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on data from other proteasinhibitors it is advisable that antacids are not taken at the same time as asgenase since it can come to resorption disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous application of anticonvulsiva known as enzymes (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepin), with amprenavir may lead to a degradation of the plasma torch of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum concentrations of calcium channel recorders such as amlodipin, diltiazem, felodipin, nimodipine, nifedipin, nimodipine, Nisoldipin, and verapamil can be increased by amprenavir, thereby increasing the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The concurrent intake of anagenase can significantly increase its plasma concentrations and strengthen with PDE5 inhibitors associated with side effects including hypotension, visual dysfunctions and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study where Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice a day with 50 µg of fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days in subjects, the Fluticasonpropionate plasma torch increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol dropped by approximately 86% (90% -interval between 82 and 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">Consequently, the simultaneous administration of aggenase with Ritonavir is not recommended together with these glucocci tioids, unless the potential benefits of a treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroidal effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">In HMG-CoA-Reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, distinctive elevations of the plasma torch are expected at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma level increases of these HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy, including a rhabdomyolysis, the combined application of these drugs is not recommended with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1991">A more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations up to stabilization of mirrors is recommended, as the plasma concentrations of Cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased at the same time as amprenavir (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, amgenerase should not be used together with the orally taken Midazolam (see section 4.3) while caution is advisable when using asgenase with parenteral Midazolam caution.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for the simultaneous use of parenteral Midazolam with other proteaseininhibitors indicate a possible increase in plasma levels from Midazolam around 3 to 4-fold.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with amprenavir, the patients should therefore be monitored on the symptoms of opium, especially if low doses of Ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to the low incidence of historical comparisons, no recommendations can currently be given, such as the amprenavir- dose should be adjusted when amprenavir is administered at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">In simultaneous dispensing of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with agglomeration, an increased control of INR (International Normalised Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of a weakening or amplification of the anthrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, therefore alternative methods for contraception are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended during concurrent administration of asgenase (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This medicine may be used during pregnancy only after careful consideration of the potential benefits for the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk lacing rats, amprenavir-related substances have been proven, but it is not known if amprenavir passes into the mother's milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproductive study of pregnant rats, which was administered by the indwelling in the uterus until the end of the lactation period Amprenavir, showed a reduced increase of 12 body weight during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of descendants including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of amprenavir to the maternity.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The Immortality of Agenase was examined in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical studies in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the Agenase treatment were slightly up to moderate, occurred early and rarely led to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">In many of these events, it is not clear whether they are in connection with the intake of agglomerate or another medicine used at the same time, or if they are a consequence of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the aforementioned side effects originate from two clinical studies (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients with protease inhibitors did not receive 1200 mg of aggenase twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (grade 2 to 4), which were evaluated by the investigators as related to the study mediation, were performed in more than 1% of the patients, as well as in the treatment of occurring laboratory changes (grade 3 to 4).</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with a redistribution of body fat (Lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and fatty tissue fat, hypertrophy of breasts and dorsocervical fat accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretroviral non-treated individuals who were treated with amprenavir in combination with lamivudine / zidovudn over a mean duration of 36 weeks, only one case (pancake) (&lt; 1%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006, patients treated patients under amprenavir 7 cases (3%) in 241 patients (11%) in 241 patients with indinavir, in combination with various NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin rashes were usually slightly pronounced, erythematous or makulopapilous nature, with or without itching and occurred usually during the second treatment week and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with amprenavir had to be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteoarthritis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term use of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with serious immune defect, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can be developed at the time of the introduction of an anti-retroviral combination therapy (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI previously treated patients who received 600 mg of aggenase twice daily along with low dosed Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) were similar; an exception were increased of triglyceride and CPK values, which received very often in patients who received ageneration together with low-dose Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdose, the patient is to observe signs of intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary, necessary support measures should be initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active center of the HIV-1 protease and thus prevents the processing of viral and gag-pol- polyproteinate stages with the result of an unequalled, non infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied in acute and chronic lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemmconcentration (IC50) of amprenavir lies in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µM in acute infected cells and is 0.41 µM in case of chronic infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of amprenavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral non-treated patients with the currently approved Fosamrenavir / Ritonavir dosing regimens - as with other Ritonavir treated treatment regimens with proteaseininhibitors - the mutations described are rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 anti-retroviral non-treated patients who received 700mg Fosamrenavir with 100mg Ritonavir twice a day in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure occurred up to 48, whereby 14 isolates could be genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">Genotypic analysis of isolates of 13 of 14 children, in which a virological failure occurred within 59, with protease inhibitors not previously treated patients showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, M36I, M46I / L, I54L / M / T / V, Q58E, D60E, I62V, A71V, V77I, V82A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its extension APV30005 (700 mg of Fosamrenavir / 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily: n = 107) in patients with virological failures over 96 weeks, the following proteasex mutations occurred:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypic resistance testing based analyses genotypic interpretation systems can be used for estimating the activity of amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamrenavir / Ritonavir in patients with proteasinhibitors-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamrenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147A / V, or I50V, or at least 4 of the following mutations L10F / I, L33F, M36I, I62V, V82A / C / F / G, I84V and L90M in conjunction with an increased phenotypic resistance to the Ritonavir and a reduced probability of a virological response.</seg>
<seg id="2027">Conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns may be subject to alteration by additional data, and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for analysing the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Based on phenotypic resistance tests clinically validated phenotypic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with genotypic data to estimate the activity of amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamrenavir / Ritonavir in patients with proteasinhibitors-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically-phenotypic cut-offs (separators) for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four genetic samples reduced with a reduced sensitivity to amprenavir generates certain cross-resistance against Ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on cross-resistance between amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamrenavir Resistenzpfade, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral non-treated patients, where a Fosamrenavir and Saquinavir (one of 25 isolates), darunavir / Ritonavir (three of 25 isolates), indinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), gasoline avir (three of 24 isolates) and Tipranavir / Ritonavir (four of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Conversely, amprenavir retains its activity against some other proteasex-resistant isolates; the maintenance of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of residual mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early termination of a failing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations within limits, which may have a detrimental effect on subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the efficacy of aggenase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open study, in which with PI previously treated adults with Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) and nucleosidangera (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with low-dose Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty (n = 163) patients with proven virus-sensitivity to agglomerate, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI were included in the part study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis showed the non-superiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the time-readjusted average change from the initial value (AAUCMB) in the virus last (AAUCMB) in the plasma after 16 weeks, at a non-sublethal shaft of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of unborn genase is based on two uncontrolled trials involving 288 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were pretreated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenase solution for taking and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low-dose Ritonavir at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of the patients included a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase in CD4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>

<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the mean duration (Tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of amprenavir is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increased, however, reduced by 30% for CMAx if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of amprenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, minimal concentration in Steady State (Cmin, ss) influences food intake, although the simultaneous food intake influences the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The seeming distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg for a body weight of 70 kg) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as unimpeded penetration of amprenavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in plasma, with the amount of unbound amprenavir which represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active components fluctuates depending on the total pharmaceutical concentration in Steady State over the area of CMAx, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 or represent a substrate of CYP3A4 must be administered with caution when given at the same time (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of asgenase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, leads to a similar daily ammonia exposure, as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is available from the solution 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules; hence, Agenase solution and Agenase Capsules are not exchangeable on a milligrammasis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">The renal Clearance of Ritonavir is also negligible, therefore the effect of kidney function disorder should be reduced to the elimination of amprenavir and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These regimens lead to amprenavir plasma levels comparable to those obtained on healthy subjects after a dose of 1200 mg of Amprenavir twice daily without simultaneous administration of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on erogenicity with amprenavir on mice and rats, hepatocelluläre Adenoma occurred in male animals with doses to the 2,0-fold (mice) or 3,8- fold (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been elucidated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>

<seg id="2060">In clinical studies, no significant liver toxicity was observed in patients, neither during the administration of agrochemicals nor after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on toxicity in young animals treated from an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the control and the animals treated with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In a systemic plasma exposition, which was significantly below (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than expected exposure to therapeutic doses in humans, however, a number of minor changes including thymus formation and minor skeletal changes were observed, which indicate a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 When Agenase capsules are used without the intensifying addition of Ritonavir (boosters), higher doses of agglomerate (1200 mg twice daily) must be used.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenase Capsules is 20 mg of Amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">The concurrent use should be done with caution in patients with low or light liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>

<seg id="2071">The Cmin values of amprenavir in plasma, which were achieved with the combination of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with calcium (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given, however, it is recommended a close monitoring since the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would low.</seg>
<seg id="2074">If these drugs are used together, caution is advisable; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring is to be performed, as precise predictions of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and Ritonavir on Delavirine is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2075">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer rifabutin together with ageneration, a reduction of the dosage of rifabutin is advised to at least half of the recommended dose 31, although no clinical data are available for this.</seg>
<seg id="2076">The serum concentrations of calcium channel recorders such as amlodipin, diltiazem, felodipin, nimodipine, nifedipin, nimodipine, Nisoldipin, and verapamil can be increased by amprenavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2077">In a clinical study where Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice a day with 50 µg of fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days in subjects, the Fluticasonpropionate plasma torch increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol dropped by approximately 86% (90% -interval between 82 and 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">In simultaneous dispensing of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with agglomeration, an increased control of INR (International Normalised Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of a weakening or amplification of the anthrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">The simultaneous administration of Ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0.035 mg Ethinyl estradiol plus 1.0 mg of Norethindron) led to a decrease in AUC and Cmin of amprenavir by 22% respectively.</seg>

<seg id="2183">The treatment with Imiquimod cream is so long to continue until all visible ward warts have disappeared in the genital or peripheral area, or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="2184">An interruption in the treatment procedure described above should be considered if intensive local inflammatory reactions occur (see Section 4.4) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area.</seg>
<seg id="2185">If in the follow-up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated lesions are only incomplete, another therapy should be started (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2186">When a dose was omitted, the patient soled the cream as soon as he / she noticed it and then continue with the usual treatment plan.</seg>
<seg id="2187">Imiquimod-cream is applied in a thin layer and rub in the purified, with cowards-infected skin area until the cream is completely drained.</seg>
<seg id="2188">There should be a consideration in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with Imiquimod and the risk associated with a possible worsening of their autoimmune disease.</seg>
<seg id="2189">There should be a consideration in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with Imiquimod and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or graft-versus-host reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2190">In other studies where no daily periauthygiene was conducted, two cases of severe phimosis and one case observed with one to circumcise leading wire surgery were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2191">In case of an application of Imiquimod-cream in higher than the recommended doses, there is increased risk of severe local skin irritation (see section 4.2.) In rare cases, even under proper application severe local skin irritations were observed, which necessitated treatment and / or have led to a temporary disability.</seg>
<seg id="2192">In cases where such reactions occurred at the output of the urethra, some women had difficulty passing urine, which necessitated emergency catheterisation and treatment of the affected area.</seg>
<seg id="2193">For the application of Imiquimod-cream immediately after treatment with other cutaneous appropriations for the treatment of external cowards in the genital and peripheral area there are no clinical experiences until now.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Limited data may indicate an increased rate of incidental reduction in HIV positive patients, Imiquimod-Creme has shown a lower efficacy in this patient group with regard to eliminating the cowards.</seg>
<seg id="2195">The treatment of basal cell carcinoma with Imiquimod within 1 cm around the eyelids, the nose, the lips, or the hair attachment was not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2196">Local skin reactions are common, but the intensity of these reactions usually decreases during therapy or the reactions form after completion of the treatment with Imiquimod cream.</seg>
<seg id="2197">If it is necessary because of the patient's complaints or due to the severity of the local skin reactions, a treatment break can be made of several days.</seg>
<seg id="2198">The clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the treatment of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2199">As there are currently no data on long-term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment, other suitable therapy forms should be considered in superfiziational basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2200">In patients with recurrent and pre-treated BCCs there are no clinical experience, so the use of previously untreated tumours is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2201">Data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tumours (&gt; 7.25 cm2) a lower probability of response to Imiquimod therapy consists.</seg>
<seg id="2202">Imiquimod has not been studied for the treatment of actinent keratoses on eyelids, inside the nose or ears or on lip area inside the lip rots.</seg>
<seg id="2203">There are only very limited data on the use of Imiquimod for the treatment of actinic keratoses on anatomical places outside the face and scalp.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The available data on the actose keratose on the lower arms and hands support the effectiveness in this application, therefore such application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions occur frequently, but these reactions usually decrease in the course of therapy at intensity or go back after putting the therapy with Imiquimod cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local skin reactions are causing great discomfort to the patient or are very strong, treatment may be exposed for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">From the data of an open clinical study, patients with more than 8 active lesions showed a lower full cure rate than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to the immunostimulating properties, Imiquimod cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2216">This evaluation of clinical signs provided according to the test plan shows that in these placebo-controlled clinical studies with 3-week treatment with Imiquimod-cream often came to local skin reactions including Erythema (30%), expo (30%), exkoriation / absent / shed (23%) and oedema (14%) (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">The evaluation of clinical signs provided according to the study plan shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with Imiquimod-Creme very often occurred with severe erythemes (31%), heavy erosions (13%), and for severe atrophy and cementing (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical studies investigating the application of Imiquimod for the treatment of actinic keratosis, alopecia was established with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment point or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The accidental unique oral absorption of 200 mg Imiquimod, which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically serious side effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, existed in hypotonia, which normalized after oral or intravenous fluid.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic investigation the systemic concentrations of the alpha interferons and other cytokines were detected after the topical application of Imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal phase 3 efficacy studies showed that the efficacy in relation to a complete healing of the cowards during an Imiquimod treatment was clearly superior over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2223">In 60% of the patients treated with Imiquimod patients the cowards were completely healed; this was the case with placebo in 20% of the 105 with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing could be reached at 23% of 157 with Imiquimod treated male patients, versus 5% of 161 with placebo treated male patients (95% CI:</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of Imiquimod in five-time application per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>

<seg id="2227">The data presented from an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years showed that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all patients treated clinically been clinically healed and this remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The effectiveness of Imiquimod with three times weekly application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week, treatment-free period, was studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non-hyper-otic, non-hyper ac- lesions within a related 25 cm2 large treatment area on the unseen scalp or on the face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The two-year data from two combined observation studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical radiotherapy after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications external cowards, actinical keratosis and superfizial basal cell carcinoma usually do not occur in paediatric patients and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara Cream was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials in children aged 2 to 15 with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of Imiquimod could not be demonstrated in these studies in the dosages there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks respectively)</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic intake of the 5% Imiquimod cream by the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratosis was observed during the three times weekly application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest drug concentrations in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the application in the face (12.5 mg, 1 per bag), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 sachets) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated obvious half-life time was approximately 10 times higher than the two-hour half-time period after the subcutaneous use in a previous study; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data for systemic exposure showed that the resorption of Imiquimod to topical application on MC-diseased skin was low in 6 - 12 years and was comparable to that with healthy adults and adults with actinic keratose or superfibrillary basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study of dermal toxicity in rats led doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG significantly reduced body weight and increased spleen weight; a study carried out for four months also showed no similar effects in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice at dermaler administration on three days a week did not induce tumors at the use point.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutated, a risk for humans is considered to be very low due to systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors appeared in the group of mice treated with the active free cream, earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyms in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with aldurazyme may develop infusion-related reactions which are defined as any side-effect occurring during infusion or at the end of the infusion day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment where revitalisation facilities are immediately available for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical Phase 3 study, it is expected that nearly all patients are IgG antibodies against Laronidase, usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution when using aldurazyms (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Because there is little experience regarding resuming the treatment after a longer break, due to the theoretically increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions after an interruption of the treatment must be handled carefully.</seg>

<seg id="2304">The side effects in clinical trials were mainly classified as infusion-related reactions which were observed in 53% of patients in phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and in 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions in connection with Aldurazyme, observed during the phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older at a treatment time of up to 4 years, are listed in the following table according to the following frequency: very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in prehistory, severe reactions occurred, including bronchospasm, respiration and facial oils (see section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2309">In most patients a seroconversion occurred within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment, with a more severe trial version (average after 26 days versus 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the Phase 3 study (or up to a premature departure from the study), no antibodies exist in 13 / 45 patients (RIP) Assay, including 3 patients, in which it had never come to Seroconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with low to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the GAG mirror in urine, while in patients with high antibody titers a variable reduction of GAG was detected in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic laronidase activity in vitro, which seemed to not affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions, even if the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for enzyme replacement therapy is one for the hydrolysis of the accumulating substrate and preventing a further accumulation of sufficient recovery of enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lysosomes, most likely via Mannose-6 phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study in 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, which showed the entire disease spectrum, the majority of patients were from the middle phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the efficacy were the percentage change in the expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute hearing test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open-label extension study, where they received 100 E / kg Aldurazyme for more 3.5 years (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with Aldurazyme in comparison to the placebo group showed an improvement in the lung function and the inability shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and of 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group as out of the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in percentage FEV that is expected to be expected is clinically not significant over this period and the absolute pulmonary volumes increased proportionally to the body size of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a hepatomegaly prior to treatment, 22 (85%) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a clear waste of the GAG mirror was found in the urine (µg / mg Kreatinin), which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In terms of the heterogeneous manifestation of the patient, which was taken into account by using a combined end point, clinically significant changes encompassed for five efficacy variable (anticipated percentage normal FEV, distance in 6-minute hearing, range of motion of the shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a worsening in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study less than 5 years (16 patients with severe form of failure and 4 with the mean reference form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased Gag- levels in the urine in week 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) was determined according to the Z-Score for this age group The younger patients with severe failure form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean cross-country form showed a normal mental development rate, whereas in the older patients with severe failure-form only limited or no advances in cognitive performance were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, studies on pharmacodynamic effects of various Aldurazyme dosing regimens were performed on the GAG mirror in the urine, the liver volume and the 6-minute hearing test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosing schedule of 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent a justifiable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosing regimens is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information available, evaluate annually, and if necessary, the summary of the features of the drug will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The pharmacokinetic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to that in older and less strongly affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in one-time administration, toxicity in repeated use and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data cannot detect any particular hazards for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with cisplatin (another medicine against cancer) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy (drugs against cancer) and "malignant" (malignant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body) and "malignant" (malignant) lung cancer that does not attack the cell epithelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is used for patients who have not been treated before, in combination with cisplatin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapies than any therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2356">In order to reduce side effects, patients should take a corticosteroid and folic acid (a vitamin) during treatment with Alimta and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">When Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, before or after the cisplatin, a "anti-drug" (drug against vomiting) and liquids (to prevent a liquid deficiency) should be given before or after the cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood pattern changes or when certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be postponed, decreased or the dose should be decreased.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of telemetrexed thus slows down the formation of the DNA and RNA and prevents the cells to divide.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of Pemetrexed into its active form goes more easily in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer duration in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant pleural othelioma, Alimta was examined in a major study of 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy against their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of docetaxel (another medicine against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (another medicine against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and cisplatin survived an average of 12.1 months compared to 9.3 months in the allround administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who previously had previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time of Alimta was 8.3 months, compared to 7.9 months in docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">However, in both studies patients, in which the cancer did not attack the squamous epithelial cells, in the administration of Alimescein extended longer survival times than with the comparative drug.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit for the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. to transfer Alimta to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each piercing bottle must be dissolved in 4.2 ml 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary dosing is removed and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is indicated in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small bronchial carcinoma (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for the treatment in second-line treatment of patients with lo-, advanced or metastatic non-small cell carcinoma except for ocular epitheliac histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² body surface (KOF) administered as intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as infusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after graduation of the Pemetrexed- infusion on the first day of every 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small bronchial carcinoma following previous chemotherapy the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered as intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">In order to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid must be given the day before and on the day of the metrometed-gift and on the day after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of Pemetrexed, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last dose of the Pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients also have to receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) in the week prior to the first telemetrexed dose as well as after each third treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving telemetrexed, a complete blood pattern should be created before each administration, including a differentiation of the leukocytes and a thrombocyte-counting.</seg>
<seg id="2379">The alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartame transaminase (AST or SGOT) and Alanin-Transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose examination must take place in the awareness of the Nadir of the blood image or the maximum non-haematological toxicity of the preceding treatment cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are applicable for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria comply with the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC grade 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients develop non-hematological toxicity ≥ grade 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy with ALIMTA must be interrupted until the patient has the value prior to treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">The treatment with ALIMTA must be canceled if in patients after 2 dose-reduction, haematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity level 3 or 4 occurs or so- on the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies have no indication that in patients aged 65 years or above, there is an increased side-risk-risk compared to patients at age 65.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data about safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical studies in patients with a creatine-clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min no dose adjustments were required, which go beyond the dose adjustments recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a Kreatinin Clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5-fold of the upper bilirubin- Intermediate and / or transaminase values of &gt; the 3.0-fold of the upper limit (in case of absence of liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0 times of the upper limit (in the presence of liver metastases) were not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients need to be monitored with regard to bone marrow immunosuppression and Pemetrexed must not be administered to patients before their absolute neutrality rate has reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the throcyte number has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of the absolute neutrophils, platelets and maximum non-haematological toxicity, as observed in previous treatment cycles (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 haematological and nichthamatological toxicity including neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neutropenia was observed when a pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 took place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore all patients treated with Pemetrexed need to be reliant on folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure to reduce the treatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate cardiac insufficiency (Kreatinin Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid the simultaneous use of nonsteroidal anti-phlogistika (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and acetylsali- cyanic acid (&gt; 1,3 g daily) for at least 2 days prior to the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients for whom a therapy is provided with Pemetrexed must avoid the intake of NSAIDs with a long half-time period for at least 5 days prior to the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, hypertension or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, in patients with clinically significant fluid accumulation in the transacular space, drainage of the effusion in front of the Pemetrexed treatment should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were occasionally reported in clinical studies with Pemetrexed, if this drug was usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic agent.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous application of attenuated life vaccines (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of irreversible foaming of reproductive capacity by means of Pemetrexed, men should be advised prior to the treatment tin to obtain advice regarding sperm conservation.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of non-steroidal anti-phlogistika (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high doses (≥ 1.3 g daily) lead to a reduced Pemetrexed excretion with the result of increased incidence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore caution is advisable if in patients with normal kidney function (creatine-clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of NSAIDs or acetylsalicylic acid can be applied in high dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2403">(ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days prior to treatment, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetrexed should be avoided (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there are no data regarding the interaction potential with NSAIDs with a long half-value such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the concurrent application must be avoided with Pemetrexed for at least 5 days prior to the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetrexed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The great intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased surveillance frequency of INR (International Normalised Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of Pemetrexed in pregnant women, but as in case of ande- ren antimetabolite severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed must not be used during pregnancy except if necessarily - requirement and after careful consideration of the use for the mother and the risk for the foetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of irreversible damage to the reproductive capacity is due to the Pemetrexed, men should be advised before the treatment begins to seek advice regarding the locking service.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether Pemetrexed passes into the mother's milk and unwanted effects in the breastfed baby can not be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma and the randomised cisplatin and telemetrexed were as well as 163 patients with mesothelioma who randomized cisplatin as monotherapy.</seg>

<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetrexed) is a antineoplastic antifolate that exercises its effect by interrupting weight- folly-dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that Pemetrexed acts as an antifolate with several targets by blocking the thymidylatynthase (DHFR) and glycinamide ribonucleotide-myltransferase (GARFT), which are folate-dependent key enzymes in the de novo biosynthesis of thymid- and purinucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multi-centric, randomised, simple-blind phase 3 study of ALIMTA plus cisplatin on cisplatin in chemonaiven patients with malignant pleural amesothelioma showed that with ALIMTA and cisplatin, patients treated a clinically significant advantage of a median 2.8-month survival compared to those patients with cisplatin.</seg>

<seg id="2542">For waist circumference the average change -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting value 103,7 cm) and with placebo -3.6 cm (starting value 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of not metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, non-metabolized orlistat in the plasma could be found sporadically and in extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without any signs of accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study with obese patients, given the minimal systemic absorbable dose, two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysierter Lactonring) and M3 (M1 after separation of the N-Formyl leucine group), could be identified, representing approximately 42% of total plasmaconcentration.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used in chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting (like cisplatin), as well as in chemotherapies, are the regular trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The efficacy of alalxi can be increased by the additional administration of a corticosteroids (a medicine that can be used as an antiemic agent).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended, since the effects in this age group do not have enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient prevents the bonding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin) to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">In three major studies Aloxi was studied in 1 842 adults who received chemotherapies, which are strong and moderate impairments for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting (132 of 223) in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, the regular trigger for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting (153 of 189) compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for alalxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission issued a permit to the Company of Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. approval for the marketing of alalxi throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Alalxi is indicated: for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in strongly vetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer and for prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderate-etogenic chemotherapy due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of alalxi for the prevention of nausea and vomiting, induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy may be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids given before chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can prolong the colon massage, patients with amnesty obstipation or signs of a subacute hedgehog should be closely monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is advisable with simultaneous dispensing of Palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients with which the Qt interval is extended or which tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to another chemotherapeutical gift, alxi shall not be used for prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron inhibited the activity of the five chemotherapeutics directed against tumours (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabin, doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">A clinical study showed no significant pharmacokinetic interactions between a unique intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a Steady-state- concentration of oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population, the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6 inductors (dexamethasone and rifampicin) and CYP2D6 inhibitors (Amiodarone, Celecoxib, Chlorpromazine, Chinidin, Ranitidine, Ritonavir, Sertraline and Terbinafin) had no significant effect on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience in the application of Palonosetron in human pregnancies is not present, so Palonosetron should not be used during pregnancy, unless it is considered necessary by the attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical studies, the most common adverse events were reported in a dose of 250 micrograms (633 patients), which at least possibly were related to Aloxi, headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the place of performance (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing experiences.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequency of adverse events such as in the other dosage groups; there were no dose-active relations to observe.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies have been carried out, however, due to the large distribution volume, a dialysis is presumably not effective therapy with an aloxi- overdosage.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1.132 patients receiving an excetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 Doxorubicin and 250 mcg / m2 Doxorubicin and 250 mcg / m2 Doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 Doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 were given in day 1 without dexamethasone intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, 667 patients who received a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazine and 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron were compared to patients receiving 32 mg of ondansetron, which were given day 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study of strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical studies for indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including Qtc intervalls with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Following the findings of pre-clinical examinations, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in the ventricular de- and repolarization and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy subjects was the assessment of the ECG effect of retired palonosetron in individual doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2,25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Absorption After an intravenous gift a slow elimination of the plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination of the body with an average terminal half-value of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally proportionally in the entire dose range of 0.-90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous administration of Palonosetron 0.25 mg each second day for a total of 3 cans, the mean mean (± SD) increase in Palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day 5.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacokinetic simulations, the total textual position (AUC0- ∞) reached once daily intravenous dosage (AUC0- ∞) was comparable to that of 0.75 mg measured after one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg; however, the CMAx was higher after the addition of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">Approximately 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and some 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which in comparison to Palonosetron have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies for metabolism demonstrated that CYP2D6 and, in lesser degree, the istive enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 mcg / kg [14C] -Palonosetron was found approximately 80% of the dose within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as unmodified active ingredient made approximately 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">The total body of 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min came after a unique intravenous lens projection.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although in patients with severe liver dysfunction, the terminal Elimination albumen and the average systemic exposure increase with Palonosetron, however, a reduction in the dose is however not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies, effects were only observed in expositions which are considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure, suggesting low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 out of preclinical studies suggest that Palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and extend the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose met in approximately the 30-fold of the therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given daily over two years, resulted in an increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid gland, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal mark) and skin tumors in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high doses and since Aloxi is determined in humans for one-time application, the relevance of these results is considered low for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) adopted a negative report, recommending the announcement of the approval of the regulatory approval for the treatment of hepatitis C by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injections solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"" "this means that alphis should resemble a biological medicine called Roferon-A with the same drug that is already approved in the EU (also called" "" "reference drug" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by a virus infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In the case of a microscopic investigation, the liver tissue has damages, moreover, the values of the liver enzymes alanin- amaminotransferase (ALT) are elevated in the blood standard.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast into which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which stimulates it to the formation of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The Alpheon supplier presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (active ingredient structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of operation, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C patients the efficacy of alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study was measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment responded to the treatment (i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns were noted that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed does not suffice.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon, the disease flamed again in more patients than with the reference drug; Alpheon also had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test used in the study investigates the question of how far the drug is an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug) is not adequately validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used for the treatment of impetigo (a skin infection associated with crust formation) and small infected laths (cracks or cuts), abrasions and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo is not to be used to treat infections which have been proven or probably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo might not work against these kinds of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under the age of 18, the skin surface to be treated may not be more than 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of the efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was concluded after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients with Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients with placebo responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin wounds, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: if the results of both studies were taken together at skin wounds, about 90% of the patients of both groups responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">However, in these two studies, however, Altargo was not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (iron-filled hollow spaces in the body tissue) or from infections which have been proven or presumably caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) is a irritation at the job.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo outweigh the risks associated with the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small hospitals, abrasions or sewed wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission issued Glaxo Group Ltd. approval for the placing of Altargo in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of sensitization or severe local irritation caused by the use of retapamulin ointment, the treatment is aborted, the ointment should be carefully wiped and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection began.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not to be used to treat infections, where MRSA is known as pathogen or suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials in secondary uninfected wounds, the efficacy of retinopathy was insufficient in patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- or 3-day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected position occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of concurrent use of retapamulin and other topical means on the same skin area has not been investigated and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations that were achieved in humans after topical application on swollen skin or infected surface wounds, clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not to be expected (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After an simultaneous offering of 2 times daily 200 mg ketoconazole, the mean Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and CMAx after topical application of 1% retapamulin ointment increased by 81% on the skin of healthy adult men.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dose adjustments are not considered necessary if topical retapamulin is used during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are inadequate regarding a statement on the birth and the fecal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be used during pregnancy when a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retapamulin is preferable to the administration of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">When deciding whether breastfeeding should continue / terminate or the therapy with Altargo continued / terminated, the benefit of breastfeeding for infants and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for women is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials involving 2150 patients with superficial skin infections that have applied Altargo, the most commonly reported incidence of irritation was at the place of adoption which considered approximately 1% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance, which is isolated through fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The active mechanism of retapamulin is based on selective inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding point of the bacterial ribosom, which distinguishes itself from the binding posts of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data point out that the Bindungsstelle ribosomales protein L3 is involved and lies in the region of the ribosomal P-Binding Unit and the Peptidyltransferase centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding on this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits the peptide transfer, block partial P-binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50S ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should, due to the local prevalence of resistance, the use of retinopathy in at least some infection forms appears questionable, an expert advice should be consulted by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of retinopathy opposite S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of failure to respond to the treatment with S.aureus, the presence of strains with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% retapamulin ointment was applied daily under occlusion on intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plasma bowls were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling took place on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the mediation and in the children between 0-12 hours after the last use.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic intake on humans after topical application of 1% ointment on 200 cm2 was reduced to 200 cm2 (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibiting.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retapamulin in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies of oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were performed over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In vitro investigation on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in mouse lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in rats micro-core test for in-vivo analysis of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, resulting in a up to 5 times higher exposure was achieved as the highest estimated exposure in humans (topical application on 200 cm2 screened skin:</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study on rats were detected in oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to the ≥ 3-fold of estimated human exposure (see above), development toxicity (decreased body weight of the fetus and delayed Ossification) and maternal toxicity.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of a vaccination plan consisting of two doses, with a protection against hepatitis B possibly only after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during the immunisation and is ensured that the vaccination that consists of two doses can be led to an end.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a review of hepatitis A or B is desired, ambition or other hepatitis A or B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"" "vaccines seem to" "" "teach" "" "the immune system (the natural defences of the body)" "" "as it can fight against a disease." ""</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system detects viruses and surface antigens as "foreign" and generates antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same ingredients as the vaccine licensed for Twinrix adults since 1996 and has been approved vaccine Twinrix Children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, however, Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of a vaccination plan consisting of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults were also used as evidence of the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of the efficacy was the share of vaccinated children, who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared to six months and a 12 month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children, Ambirix took a month after the final injection to develop protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix was similar to six and a 12-month distance between injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, matness (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other constituents or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission issued GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, a permit for placing Ambirix in its entirety.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardisation plan for the primeval polarization with Ambirix comprises two vaccinations, whereby the first dose is at the date of choice and the second dose ranges from six to twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a refresher vaccination is desired for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, it can be vaccinated with the corresponding monovalent vaccines or a combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) - and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) - and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) - and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) - and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) - are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured whether immunocompetent individuals who have responded to hepatitis C inoculation may require rejuvenation as protection, since they may also be protected by immunological memory in no longer detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3. as with all injection-vaccines, for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the dispensing of the vaccine, appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a fast protection against hepatitis B is required, the standard protocol is recommended using the combination vaccine containing 360 ELISA units with a formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In the case of hemodialysis patients and individuals with malfunctions of the immune system, there is no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs anti-mortar value after the Grundimmunisation, so that in these cases the addition of further vaccinations may be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intrathermale injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a suboptimal vaccination in the buttosis muscle, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However, with thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disorders, Ambirix can be injected exceptionally subcutaneous as it can come to bleeding in these cases after intramuscular administration.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection, tetanus, acellular paste, intraoperative poliomyelitis- and Haemophilus influenza type b-vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or combined with a combined measur- mumps-rubella vaccine, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects, it has to be assumed that no sufficient immune response is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccinations of this formulation in adults, the incidence of pain, redness, swelling, maternity, gastroenteritis, headache and fever comparable to the incidence that was observed in the previous thiomersal and preservative-containing vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccinations were administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 up to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study of 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years, the compatibility of Ambirix was compared to the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and matacity on a calculation basis per vaccination dose Ambirix, but not based on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the administration of Ambirix in 50,7% of the subjects, compared to 39.1% in subjects after the gift of a dose of 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the subjects who had given Ambirix had reported about pain, compared to 63.8% in the subjects who had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of maternity was comparable to that per proband (i.e. over the total vaccination cycle at 39.6% of the subjects who received Ambirix, compared to 36.2% in the subjects who received the 3-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of severe pain and maternity was low and comparable to those observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-dose vaccine regimen.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1- to 11-year-old vaccines, the presence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambirixgruppe was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3-dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units formally inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11- year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix was reported a more frequent occurrence of pains (at the injection site) per dose, not per proband.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of vaccines that reported severe side effects during the 2-dose vaccine with Ambirix or during the 3-dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units formally inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was statistically not different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted in vaccines aged 1 up to 15 years, the dose rates for anti-HAV were 99.1% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The Seroconversion rates for Anti-HBs were 74.2% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study carried out between 12- and including 15-year-olds, 142 cans of Ambirix and 147 were given the standard combination vaccine with three cans.</seg>
<seg id="2764">For the 289 individuals whose immunogenicity was expendable, the seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) against hepatitis B were significantly higher in the month 2 and 6 after offering the 3-dose vaccine significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune responses, which were achieved in a clinical comparative study from 1- to 11-year-olds one month after the full inoculation series (i.e., in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies the vaccines received either a 2-dose vaccination pattern with Ambirix or a 3-dose vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units formally inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In people who were at the time of primacy between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs could be detected over at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6 month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune reaction observed in this study was comparable to those observed after vaccination of 3 cans with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units formally inactivated hepatitis- A-virus and 10 µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study from 12- to including 15-year-olds could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies comparable to 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 month vaccine is comparable to that in the 0-12 months vaccine scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose Ambirix was administered at the same time with the rejuvenation of a combined diphtherie-, tetanus, acellular, inactivated poliomyelitis- and 8 Haemophilus influenza type b-vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with the first dose of a combined measurer-mumps-mumps-vaccine, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens.</seg>

<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix cannot completely protect prior to an infection with hepatitis A or hepatitis B virus, even if the full inoculation series has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child are already infected with hepatitis A or hepatitis B virus prior to the administration of both vaccine doses (although you / your child will not feel uncomfortable or sick at the vaccine time) vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>

<seg id="2785">With a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination the doctor will advise you / your child from vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, it will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vaccination (360 ELISA units of a formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccine of this vaccine with decreased content of effective ingredients is usually administered one month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vaccination protection prior to ending the vaccine series.</seg>

<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals to vaccination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take other medicines (including those who have been vaccinated with no prescription) or if you / your child has recently been vaccinated / has received or has received immunoglobulins (antibodies) or has been planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine has to be given with Ambirix at the same time, it should be vaccinated in separate places and as different limbs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix should be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">On the basis of the data that has been known for placing the first permit for the placing of the market, CHMP advocated that the benefit-risk relationship for Ambirix has remained positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix was placed in transport only in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonia can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyperammonium-encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonia is divided into several individual doses at meals - swallowed, mixed with food or through a Gastrostomieschlauch (through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading tube) or a nasal onde (through the nose into the stomach of leading tube).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study because ammonites could not be compared with another treatment or placebo (a pseudo-drug, i.e. without active ingredient).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonia can also lead to loss of appetite, a abnormal acidity in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, impotence, fluid retention, taste disorders or taste seeds, stomach aches, vomiting, nausea, constipation, skin rash, unpleasant bodily odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that ammonia in patients with disorders of the urea cycle effectively prevents ammonia values.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "ammonite was approved under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "" "due to the rarity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information to this drug." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients where a complete enzyme deficiency has already been manifested in newborns (within the first 28 life days).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifect form (incomplete enzyme defect, which manifests itself after the first lifetime), there is an indication for use when a hyperammonia encephalopathy is found in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disruptions, AM89PS is also available in granulated form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually taking into account the protein intolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient for the growth and development.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to clinical experience, normal daily dose is sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13,0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg, as well as adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients who suffer from an early manifesto lack of carbonic phosphate synthetase or ornithinly meat.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Arginine deficiency in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8,8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day should be obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMBPS tablets may not be administered to patients with swallowing disruptions, as there is a risk for the emergence of esophagus ulcera when the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet consists of 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g of sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMP MONAPS should therefore be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency as well as with sodium retention and edema.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolism and excretion of sodium phenyl butyrate is done via the liver and kidneys, AMP MONAPS should be used for patients with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMP MONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate to young rats with high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg), it came to a slowdown of neuronal multiplication and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetate is excreted in the mother's milk, and for this reason the use of AMP MONAPS is contraindicated while breast-feeding (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMP MONAPS at 56% of patients at least an adverse event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AMP MONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMHTP (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by a 18 year old anorecttic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with lactic acidosis, severe hypokalemia, armoroctopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">An overdose case occurred in a 5 month old infant with an accidental dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms proceed with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity in an intravenous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active compound that conjugates glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Anecrically seen is phenylacetylglutamine comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the elimination of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram of the sodium phenyl butyrate between 0.15 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical results.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifesto form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always inflicted, and the disease itself led to death even in the treatment of peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen free analogues within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hemodialysis, utilization of alternative methods of nitrogen elimination (sodium phenyl butyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced food and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborns in postpartal (but within the first month of life) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which were already treated before the first occurrence of hyperammonia encephalopathy, survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it was time with many mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-manifested form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygotic form of the ornithinkobamylase deficiency), which were recovered from hyperhibious encephalopathy and treated permanently with sodium phenylbutyrate and a protein-reduced diet, survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible for treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in liver and kidney cells with glutamine, where phenylacetylglutamine is formed.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined according to a single dose of 5 g of sodium phenylbutyrate in sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, the hemoglobin metabolism and with liver cirrhosis according to individual release as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (not controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites was also examined in cancer patients after intravenous administration of sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral dose of 5 g of sodium phenyl butyrate in tablet form, 15 minutes after taking measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2846">According to different doses of phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) in the next morning no phenylacetate in the plasma was detectable in the majority of patients with urea-occlusions or hemoglobin.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three of six patients with cirrhosis, which were repeatedly treated with sodium phenylbutyrate (20 g / day oral in three individual doses), the mean phenylacetate concentrations in the plasma torch on the third day were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The medication is excreted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100% in the form of conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine above the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the Micronucleus test results, sodium phenylbutyrate had no conclusive effects (investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMBPS Granules are either orally taken (infants and children who cannot swallow any tablets, or patients with swallowing disruptions) or via a Gastrostomieschlauch or a nasal onde.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to clinical experience, normal daily dose is sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13,0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg, as well as adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients who suffer from an early manifesto lack of carbonic phosphate synthetase or ornithinly meat.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMHTP granulate contains 124 mg (5,4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrate, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g of sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat flutes were exposed before the birth of phenylacetate (active metabolic of phenylbutyrate), it came to lesions in the pyramids cells of the brain cortex.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMHTP (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by a 18 year old anorecttic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with lactic acidosis, severe hypokalemia, armoroctopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Clinically seen is phenylacetylglutamine comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of investigations on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, it can be assumed that for each gram, sodium phenyl butyrate is produced between 0.15 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and in some patients further worsening of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral dosage of 5 g of sodium phenyl butyrate in granulate form, 15 minutes after taking measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of durability the patient can store the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">This procedure contains the small measuring spoon 0,95 g, the average measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g of sodium phenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medication via a probe, AMHTP can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenyl butyrate is up to 5 g in 10 ml water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so they cannot excrete the nitrogen containing waste products that accumulate in the body after consuming proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If you are taking laboratory tests, you need to tell the doctor that you are taking AMP MONAPS because sodium phenylbutyrate can influence the results of certain laboratory studies.</seg>
<seg id="2866">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medicines or taken recently, even if it is not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During the lactation period, you may not take AMP MONAPS as the medicine could go over to breast milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases, confusion, headache, taste disturbances, obstruction of hearing, disorientation, memory disturbances and a deterioration of existing neurological conditions were observed.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS, decreased blood supply to the heart), for example with instable angina (a form of pains in the chest of different thicknesses) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "stress" (an anomal measurement value in electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If Angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who undergo a PCI, a higher dose is administered and infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angiox was compared to the conventional combination treatment with heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI in combination with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, other medicines for preventing blood clots).</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, the patient was frequently used a stent (a short tube which remains in the arteries to prevent clutter), and they additionally received other medicines to prevent clots, such as ciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, Angiox - with or without the administration of GPI - was as effective in preventing new events (deaths, heart attacks or vascularization) after 30 days and a year as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who undergo a PCI therapy, Angiox was as effective in all indicators as heparin, except for severe bleeding, in which it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to bivalerudin, other herdsmides or one of the other constituents.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be used in patients who had a bleeding recently, as well as in people with severe high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is an acceptable replacement for heparin during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the Company The Medicines Company UK Ltd to introduce anox across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndromes (instabile Angina / non - ST-lift infarction) (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of emergency intervention or if an early intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dosage of Angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous acuity of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is carried out in a further consequence, an additional Bolus of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and infusion is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2893">After the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical needs.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure, a stud of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended Dosage of Angiox in patients with one PCI consists of an initial intravenous capsulation of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an intravenous infusion immediately followed by a dose of 1.75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a single Bolus administration of Angiox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to under 225 seconds, a second release of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values, the reformed and diluted medicine should be carefully mixed before the application and the bolus dose is quickly administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dosis is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with severe kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to a PCI (whether treated with bivalerudin against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is below 225 seconds, a second captive dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bolusdocsis can be examined again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, included in the III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which resulted in the approval, the ACT was 5 minutes after offering the bivalira bolus without dose adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients Angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">The treatment with angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after the end of the intravenous administration of unfractionated heparin or 8 hours after the subcutaneous administration of low-molecule heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• known hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or other constituents or against Hirudine • active bleeding or increased blood-risk due to a disturbance of the hemostasis and / or irreversible bacterial endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and for dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when bivalent in combination with another anticoagulant is administered (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if the most bleeding of arterial punctuation occurs in PCI patients, patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may occur throughout the treatment of bleeding throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are taking warfarin and treated with bivalerudin, a monitoring of the INR value (International standardization ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after setting of treatment with bivalerudin returns once again the level existing before the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge about the active mechanism of anticoagulants (heparin, warfarin, thrombocyte aggregationshemmer), it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of blood.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bivalerudis with platelbocyte aggregates or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological hemostasis parameters are regularly monitored.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The experimental studies are inadequate with regard to the effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, the binding or postnatal development (see under section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomised to bivalira alone, 4604 were randomised to bivalira plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and 4603 were randomised to either unfractionated heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the bivalent group as well as in the comparative groups treated with heparin, women and patients more than 65 years of age were more common in adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleedings were defined according to Acuity and Timi scales for severe bleeding as in the footnotes of Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and severe bleedings were significantly less frequent in bivalent studies than in groups with heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and bivaliddin plus GPIIb / III- inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">Acuity severe bleeding has been defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the point of point, reduction of hemoglobin level of ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood supply, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed bleeding localizations which occurred at more than 0.1% (occasionally) were "other" points, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or neck.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following data on side effects are based on data from a clinical trial with bivalerudin in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivalirudin group and in the comparative groups treated with heparin, women and patients more than 65 years were more common in adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently under Bivalira than in the comparative group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, were reported in practice following a comprehensive application and are grouped according to system organclasses in table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In the event of an overdose, the treatment with bivalerudin is immediately canceled and the patient is closely intermeshed with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivalircular, a direct and specific thrombininhibitor, which binds both at the catalytic center and the Anionic Binding region of Thrombin, regardless of whether it is bound in the liquid phase or at tinnsel.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The Binding of Bivalira in Thrombin, and with it its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin, in turn, regenerates the binding of bivalerudin ARG3-Pro4, thus regenerating the function of the active center of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, bivalirrel with serum of patients, in which in the past, had come to heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduzated thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS), did not induce thrombocytes aggregate reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy subjects and in patients, bivalirrel shows a dose and concentration-dependent antikoagulatory effect, which is proven by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was performed in the following cases an additional bolt of 0.5mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In arm A of the Acuity trial, unfractionated Heparin or Enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with instable angina / non-ST-stroke infarction (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomised to receive a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor either before the beginning of angiography (at the time of randomization) or with the PCI.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes which require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected into the abdominal wall, thigh or upper arm or administered as a continuous infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level (sugar) in the blood or the insulin is not effective.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin fluctuate differs very slightly from human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter active duration as a short-lived human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in the application in combination with a long-effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between 4 and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In case of type 2 diabetes, where the body insulin is not processed effectively, Apidra was examined in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of potency was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes, decreased after six months a decrease of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) in comparison to a reduction of 0.14% at insulin lispro.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the reduction in HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0,30% in human normal ulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin cline or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">Apidra cans may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission informed the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the placing of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection either in the abdominal wall, thigh or delta muscle or subcutaneous through continuous infusion into the area of abdominal bags.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced gluconeogenesis and the reduced insulin metabolism, insulin needs can be reduced in patients with a limitation of liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the active strength, the brand (producer), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc-delayed etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can withdraw a change in the insulin demand.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An inadequate dosage or abrupture of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of one patient to another insulin type or insulin of another manufacturer should be conducted under strict medical supervision and can make a change of the dosage required.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change in the conversion of the treatment regimen.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances that increase the blood-bearing activity and increase the propensity to hypoglycemia are oral antidiabetic, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrate, fluoxetine, monotamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, sulphoxifyllin, propoxyphs, salizylates and sulphamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, the effects of sympatholytics such as beta loosen, Clonidin, Guanethidin and Reserpin may be weakened or missing the symptoms of adrenergic counterregulation.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Experimental studies of reproductive toxicity revealed no differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known if insulin reaction occurs in human breast milk, but in general insulin does not occur in the mother's milk, nor is it resorbated after oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are listed in clinical studies classified by undesirable pharmaceutical shortages (very often: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally: ≥ 1 / 1.000, &lt; 1 / 100; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on the available data is not inestimable).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold - welness, cool and pale skin, tiredness, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual creation or weakness, confusion, concentration disorders, dizziness, excessive Hunting, changes in vision, headaches, nausea and heart palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy's failure to continuously change the injection site within the injection-area can result in a lipodystrophy at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemias with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glukagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by an appropriately trained person or treated by a doctor by intravenous addictions.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After glucose, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypoglycaemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption (especially skeletal musculature and fat) as well as the inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that with subcutaneous gait of insulin sensitivity the efficiency occurs faster and the duration is shorter than with hug-manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study of 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes milk, insulin fluctuation showed a proportionate glucose-giving effect in the therapeutic dose of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a proportionate increase in the glucose-giving effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin flow is twice as fast as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucose-giving effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data was evident that in an application of insulin reactions 2 minutes before the meal a similar post-pranic glycaemic control is reached, as with a humanely normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Was insulin-swallowed 2 minutes before meal, a better postprandial control was reached than with a human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin tea is consumed 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a similar glycaemic control is achieved as with a human normal ulin, which is given 2 minutes before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin flow in gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the start of the meal was given before the start of the meal (Fig 1A) as well as compared to human normal ulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin production at the gift of 15 minutes (GLULISIN - after) after the start of the meal compared to human nor- malinulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the start of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
