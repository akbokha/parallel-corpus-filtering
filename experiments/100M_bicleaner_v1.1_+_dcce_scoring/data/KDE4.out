package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; in spite of their small size they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them easier available .
further information about the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or , select Settings extensions ... Open the tab tools and select the desired modules .
this is a list of standard Settings modules from the package k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that you may need more modules on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; click on Tools Cancel . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of cr@@ ashes if available .
the module view filter ( also known as the folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras View Filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or , select Tools DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed website . as default , the display begins with the root node of the document , for example : document@@ azione , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; displays a further view of objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory on local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the content of your local fil@@ esystem .
the feature of &amp; FS@@ View ; is to represent ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree map . tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rec@@ t@@ angle whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View , the size is the size of a file or folder , with the size of a folder defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files , even then easily identified , can be easily identified when it is far down in the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX command you can be considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the Tre@@ emap depic@@ tion is a rec@@ t@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rectang@@ les have meaningful color and labelling settings .
the color of a rec@@ t@@ angle that is switched over View Mode can be either depth for the easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the illustration of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rec@@ t@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the respective file or folder . for each feature you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough room to display or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rectang@@ les occur . furthermore , you can set the relative position of the let@@ tering in the rec@@ t@@ angle .
in case of representation algorithms for st@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the surface is proportional to the size of the entry . at the sit@@ emap in &amp; FS@@ View ; this goal is not always maintained . it will be drawn up to the ne@@ sting of the entries , and this framework needs space , which then gets lost to the subordin@@ ate entries , if the rec@@ t@@ angle is quad@@ r@@ atic .
as spl@@ itting the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries occurs , the implementation remains up to the implementation . in this case , it is necessary for the label and to avoid space losses through frame always advantageous the areas to arise that are as square as possible . the best methods in this are lines , columns or recur@@ sive branches .
you can set the minimum represented area for an entry on the menu entry View on area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn in the surface of the higher @-@ level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally was &amp; FS@@ View ; conceived as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get developed for the application of K@@ Cach@@ ing@@ ind .
the picture gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Tools Gallery ... or by C@@ trl ; I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when you access the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; View menu &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will open a dialog with which you can set the image of the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot;

you can specify whether the size of the images is shown in the gallery in the gallery .
in the dialog , specify where the gallery will be saved and which sub@@ folders should be included .
in the file selection saved in HTML file , specify where the HTML page should be saved .
with the sub @-@ folder check box , you can set with a slider or a rot@@ ational field to which level the sub@@ folders will be included .
copy the original pictures with the check box if the original pictures are to be copied to the gallery .
using the comment file check box , you can specify a comment file for cap@@ turing the images in the gallery .
for the thumb@@ nails , you can set a different color depth than in the original pictures for the thumb@@ nails .
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings provides you with easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to help you connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , any media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam ; together .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides fast image editing with basic image editing tools . you can use them to view , comment and correct your photos . editing capabilities can be easily extended with K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface ( Manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ comes ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , DNG @-@ export and ICC color management workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , like &amp; eg ; via the camera or lens , via which can be searched .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ als ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of end users . you should therefore report problems and improvement options .
this opens a dialog with a signed link . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . all the information you need is already registered . follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . that is , the users and developers can help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to ask you about other users of &amp; digi@@ kam ; ask and hopefully soon answer questions of other users .
you can also visit the digi@@ p@@ ate ; homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam ; to learn .
the best start to join &amp; digi@@ came ; to participate , registration is in the developer mailing list . instructions for logging in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
when you start &amp; digi@@ es ; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where to store your pictures and database . you can enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the path name or click the folder icon folder to select a folder .
in the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data retri@@ eval is stored . this path remains the same for all folders .
later you can add as many folders as you would like to add . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will be used in addition as an Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek . settings digi@@ es set up collections
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder containing pictures as the base folder . &amp; digi@@ kam ; looks at any sub@@ folder as an album . no image will be changed . during browsing the folders you will see a progress gauge like this :
&amp; digi@@ kam ; dur@@ es recur@@ sively the library path in its entire depth . you cannot excl@@ ude sub @-@ folders unless it i@@ ste in hidden folder . this allows you to insert out @-@ of @-@ the @-@ board and digi@@ al ; do this by inser@@ ting a dot before the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ spiel don &apos;t have photos as symbols . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set up in &amp; digi@@ kam ; set up your digital camera . afterwards , you should learn how to use My albums and My key@@ word box to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , you can handle it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu aid menu .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the Ro@@ h Decoder settings and raw workflow sequences .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to help you connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , any media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam ; together .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera then appears as a disk drive . the camera then appears as a disk drive . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deri@@ vatives . older cameras may use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 to communicate with digital cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , distribut@@ able software collection for digital cameras supporting a steadily increasing number of more than 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widespread protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripher@@ als without the need of additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and transm@@ issions via the serial port are slow , this connection is now dep@@ rec@@ ated . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found at this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that the thumb@@ nails can be read reliably by a few lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera operators to read the preview images . if the Ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may not be able to see thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things in &amp; digi@@ es ; is how easy its functionality can be expanded through modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( Manual ) is an approach to develop a common modular structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; Photo Album , Sho@@ wi@@ gs and G@@ wen@@ view to develop . the goal is to provide the modules for all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can be a user . their advantage is that it is much simpler , and digi@@ es ; by writing a small module to add a function as the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
moving and laying images works everywhere : you can put an image in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ edi@@ m , above the horizontal divi@@ ding line or in another application window . the only restriction is that a picture cannot be stored in keywords , date list or searches .
- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , raw , movies and audio
the text filter is only used for fields which are currently displayed in the symbol view . so the filter on the fil@@ en@@ ame only works if this ind icon is also displayed . which fields are displayed you can configure in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ Settings .
the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted according to the folders in which they were stored on the hard drive , by the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ ches or by the date on which the album was initially created .
if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select Album Imp@@ orts images to scan . you can also add a scre@@ enshot to an album . select Album Imp@@ ort scre@@ enshot .
to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the then appearing menu you will need to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all the photos and move it to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album properties , you need to right click on the album and select Edit properties in the pop @-@ up menu .
Alb@@ um@@ - Collec@@ tions : are a method to mark your albums , so that you can be group@@ ed under a shared name . the collection used by you will be used to sort your photos by selecting the collection from the toolbar or view albums By collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the Settings for collections .
the Alb@@ um@@ - Date : will be used if you sort your albums by date with View albums By date .
the buttons Äl@@ test@@ ers , average , New Year : these set the date on the oldest , the newest picture or the average of the album . for this , first try to calculate the average of the pictures from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , instead , the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder .
when you first entered an album in &amp; digi@@ kam , the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this is meant to help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo on the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album symbol , you need to click the image with the right mouse button and set it in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol .
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the field My key@@ word list at the bottom of the main window . album collections have a different effect . the collection includes always all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all pictures will be displayed in this album in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can customize the size of this preview with the two magni@@ fying buttons in the toolbar .
when you open an album for the first time , you have to wait short while the preview images are generated . you can avoid this using the Tools menu View all preview images .
information on each image will be displayed below the respective preview . what information these are , can be changed by setting the digi@@ ti@@ sed settings . select the albums page here and adjust the area preview pictures to your wishes .
the preview pictures have help windows that appear . the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the scre@@ enshot above in the section introduction to the main window shows such a help window .
the image editing shows your photos and allows you to organize a number of improvements to it . you can select all the features associated with &amp; digi@@ es ; you can choose between viewing the images , slide show or editing the pictures .
you can open the image editing with a photo by using either F@@ 4 image editing ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit ... Select . in the section digi@@ kam , image editing you can see a tutorial on how to edit your photos . with the editing , you can view your photos and change them .
it can happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not provided . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub@@ menu of opening . for this , and how to customize them to your needs , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after processing through other image manipulation programs , problems with the metadata contained in the picture may occur . some programs do not store these data with when you save the changed image . this information is lost from EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc .
the simpl@@ est is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select Dre@@ ams . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photo , you can right click the preview and select F2 ren@@ aming from the context menu . note that you keep the extension ( .jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc . ) .
if you delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ kam , it is moved to the tr@@ ash of &amp; k@@ de ; shi@@ fted . F@@ 8 image Del@@ ete or Del If you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
the View &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ ste@@ quot ; organiz@@ es your photos by means of the data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; use either the EX@@ IF date or if it is not available , the date of the last modification of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month are shown in the image view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view so that you can only show the photos of the selected days .
photos with keywords provided a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalogue your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . once a key@@ word has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found again by selecting this key@@ word or search .
if a key@@ word is selected , all photos marked with this key@@ word will be displayed .
keywords can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords logical . you can also easily fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word section ; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for fast access and assigned key@@ word in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . you can also use your keywords in other programs . furthermore , the keywords in the loss of the database are re @-@ imported as soon as &amp; nbsp ; the images notice .
you can add new keywords by clicking the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My key word ; or click on an existing key@@ word and then select New key@@ word . if you have cli@@ cked on an existing key@@ word , this will become the sub@@ stit@@ ch@@ word of this key@@ word .
you can delete a key@@ word by clicking on the key@@ word with the right mouse button and del@@ eting . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the key@@ word will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a key@@ word by drag@@ ging it to the desired position in the tree and lay down there . then a menu appears giving you the possibility to move the key@@ word . a key@@ word can only be in the tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a key@@ word by clicking with the right mouse button and edit the keywords in the context menu . you can change the name of the key@@ word and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word ;
to select another photo as an album symbol , you need to click the image with the right mouse button and select the album in the pop @-@ up menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol .
this can be done in two ways : once you &apos;ve picked up the photos you want to use with a key@@ word , you can click on the appropriate key@@ word in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word ; alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the preview of the pictures and select the key@@ word from the context menu .
you can add a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is displayed once you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way you can give a key@@ word for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made , etc .
once you have a photo with key@@ word , this is displayed under the preview of the image in the main window .
you can remove a key@@ word in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and select Rem@@ ove From the Tags menu . the menu will show you only the keywords assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ dependent hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved through this hist@@ ogram . to select a time@@ frame , you only need to click on the lower rec@@ t@@ angle of the box , which indicates the time unit . this will display all the associated images in the main window .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . this then appears in the list below .
include all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more .
in the search box , a small lamp is the green when the search is found . if you click here the filter will be deleted and all pictures will be shown again . if the search has not found anything , then the lamp is red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this , you get a simple search box as described above . you can save this search here but as a live search which always filters what you typ@@ ed as search criteria .
if you are satisfied with your selection , press OK and the search will be performed . the results will be used in the My search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after searching , you just need to select the corresponding item from the View My search list and select an option in its pop @-@ up menu .
if you select to edit search , the search dialog will appear again with the previously entered search information . if you choose to edit an advanced search , the dialog for Advanced Search will appear . you can find more information in the Advanced search section .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete in the context menu .
advanced Search provides an advanced search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Alb@@ end@@ aten@@ bank . an option can be added to this list with search group / delete the search group . each option can be linked to others via the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ... you can create searches of type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ GHT .
&amp; nbsp ; character@@ izes every image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these sig@@ natur@@ es . the lower the difference between two picture sig@@ natur@@ es , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop every picture to find a similar one . using a sw@@ ell@@ erts the result selection can be enlarged or res@@ ized . if you push a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : hand @-@ hand sk@@ etches : draw a fast sketch and &amp; digit@@ ally ; find the matching pictures . also here a sw@@ elling value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can press the mouse wheel in or out , or hold it and move it . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to pull up a square . all images within these coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a Live Geo@@ folder .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , even raw files , together .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L D@@ em Ligh@@ ting table from the context menu . the selection will be added to the light table and open its window . if you are back in the main window , you can quickly open the light table with L Tools .
from the preview bar you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right area of the window . a small arrow will show you which copy in which window area is to be seen . if you select to synchron@@ ize from the toolbar and perform the zoo or im@@ position operations on one of the pictures , then they will be compared with the other picture . you can therefore compare the same area of the two pictures .
another mode is better suited to quickly select from a picture series . if you are using p@@ airing from the toolbar , then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas to compare . now use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to display it in the right pane .
of course , the normal del@@ e@@ tion actions also work directly from the light table like e.g. F@@ 4 file Edit ....
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window are available for both thumb@@ nails in the light table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
in the lower end of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function that you can see on the crossed arrows . to rot@@ ate the visible area of the picture , you need to click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB . in the mode preview , then both pictures will show the same image area .
the zoom works as well as in other views . simply use the zoom kno@@ b under the images or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom in and out into the image . this happens in both pictures when you are in the Preview mode .
what is a digital asset management - away from the mo@@ de@@ word ? digital asset management considers every part of the process after the image has been taken up to the final output and permanent storage . each of the photos absor@@ bs , sc@@ ans or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory management . most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient manner .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your pictures , find , protect and use your pictures . in doing so , we focus on the procedures for digital photographers the &amp; digi@@ kam ; use . we look at downloading , ren@@ aming , converting , converting , group@@ ing , backing , optim@@ ising , waiting and export@@ ing image files .
&amp; quot ; Digit@@ ale population management takes on , index@@ ed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , trans@@ forms , ready and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is stored in accordance with your definition data that provides information on or a documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
I dare to claim that if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer then you need to find a certain photo without inventory management . if you do not even know how many photos you have , then do not use &amp; digi@@ kam ; . the approach metadata both in a database and in image files guarantees very fast searching and secure archiving for which you can freely access other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you do anything in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you must decide whether you want to save them to a reserved drive , or on a network drive &amp; etc .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . vacation pictures can be easily found across your memory location unless you were in one year to organize several times in the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing of photos , archiving , work sequences , constant supply of pictures to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or an derived image .
we also recommend the metadata option to be stored in the settings page of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ kam ; this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written to the file . if you forget it , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate point in the Album File menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which ? this includes &amp; digi@@ es ; them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important .
now the real work starts , since you should choose to assign keywords , labelling and valu@@ ation to each photo . of course , you can choose all the images that need the same attribute and set the value . this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos at work .
let &apos;s talk with keywords , keywords as you often call in other programs or continue categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import cat@@ alo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded key@@ word , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically insert the tree for you or insert the images in the right place . changing the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by drag@@ ging a sub @-@ tree to another .
the graph shows how different metadata over@@ comes . this is a very rough representation , as each block of metadata is in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to in@@ scrip@@ tions or comments , the third important tool for cat@@ alo@@ gu@@ ing your metadata .
you don &apos;t want to let your photos simply be seen , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies .
look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach view . if you look at it closer then catch some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you this of the Al@@ lied &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Beach@@ quot ; in French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . w@@ ow ! you begin to dream , associations , memories , the historical period of time is present again , you may even hear the silence .
for others who look at your photos the title might be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer , to help him about the motive you are moving has to understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength to work only with a label for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as lab@@ eling . if you export your images to web galleries , then these labels will be exported to your li@@ king and / or the title of the web gallery system .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without navigation system ? was it Earth not a boring planet from Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now starts with speed of light .
the possibilities to exploit the ge@@ ol@@ ocation are countless and become deeper into the future . I am sure one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your journeys using pictures with ge@@ ographic information . &amp; digi@@ kam ; can also export k@@ ml files that can be opened with Goo@@ gle@@ Earth . you can also export the images to Gallery@@ 2 , pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a pu@@ n with copyright and describes practice the copy@@ rights to use to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you what information in the setting page of &amp; digi@@ kam ; as information should be depos@@ ited :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should include your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to use the photographer &apos;s name , e.g. to protect the photographer &apos;s identity , then the name of a company or organization can be used .
author title : associated with the author . this field contains the work name of the photographer . examples of this can be titles like : employed photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent commercial photographer . as this is a note to the author &apos;s field , this must be completed as well .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for vendors ) : use the provider field to identify who the photo offers . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here that you provide the picture to others . if the picture is a stock photo , then here the group / agency that offers the picture is given here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , even though they do not provide protection against mis@@ use . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator can delete or modify them . the solution for this problem is digital water@@ marks . for private persons this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and half professionals this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique for each image . in the near future , it will provide such a module for batch processing .
topics : record error , disk failure , electric sho@@ cks , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , des@@ aster@@ work , lifetime , temperature , data size , widespread super@@ sti@@ tions
of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on a fire . these kinds of losses are the same which can happen to you in traditional paper pictures or neg@@ atives . in this section we are dealing with problems with the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll on@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss .
to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , these must be handled careful and you can &apos;t trust you for more than a few years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are more difficult to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ read@@ able , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable .
CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to errors , even if you were just written . therefore , use a control mechanism to protect yourself . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control sum@@ s . despite this massive protection , they are aging through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that causes miracle in CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives etc .
optical Media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six@@ sm@@ al the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB . everything that has been said about CDs and DVDs is of course also valid for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
slowly burn with a good record on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ate format . also , you should read the media with a description , date and author and then store it on a clean , dark dry and protected site . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media .
flo@@ ppy manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves . their manufacturers &apos; warran@@ ties include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard disks on this subject : Dis@@ mis@@ erst@@ u@@ die
in brief : disks hold the longest if you are operated in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . at lower temperature range , the error rate increases dramatically . electronic parts of the controller are the most common error cause , SM@@ ART cannot detect these errors . some of SM@@ ART errors indicate the im@@ min@@ ent failure .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can normally be restored without major problems .
while most electrical devices account not much , it looks different for devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes . these can cause severe damage . on your computer , these an@@ om@@ ali@@ es can cause severe key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware aging , damaged mother@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against current peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy source and yields the rest . it is normally available in the form of a connector bar . however , remember that not every connector bar also contains over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should take care that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also take care that it offers protection against lightning strike and thus protects the properly connected devices .
as an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should be careful that even all peripher@@ al devices connected to your system are also protected . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage sho@@ oter that also includes a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of cable mo@@ de@@ ms and television .
if you have a laptop , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are designed specifically for not@@ ebooks and are therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete out@@ age . even an emergency of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a break @-@ free power supply .
in addition to the protection against over@@ volt@@ ages , these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power out@@ age occurs . this gives you the possibility to save your data and run down the system . if you buy a US@@ V then you should be sure that they are fulfilling the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting .
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and and compare its safety in case of electricity dis@@ rup@@ tions with the cost to avoid this . a high quality over@@ voltage protection can cost you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected .
the Amazon web service includes S3 - Sim@@ ple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can install it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data .
however , they are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you must send the data over the compar@@ atively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general securing solution .
pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services available on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online .
from the perspective of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . data transmission errors are automatically cleared thanks to the TCP protocol , and with the large companies it contains a backup and a distributed memory .
the diagram illustr@@ ates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transfers are vulnerable to transmission errors . the Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs file system ensures at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred , not if this happened in your hardware . all of these distur@@ ban@@ ces remain un@@ discovered until you were destroyed one day . no one seems to have thought of it . no one seems to have thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of data loss , since they generate interactions within the data streams . in normal fil@@ es@@ ystems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of bugs per year .
it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is soon available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protective mechanisms used by Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; however , it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % of the work@@ station systems . at Not@@ ebooks , the proportion of theft is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to a lower damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; has been no longer si@@ ghted for a long time .
open source fil@@ es@@ ystems are less vulnerable to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the common file systems . you can find a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the examination process during a sudden dis@@ ruption during surgery is higher and an un@@ defined status will be avoided . however , if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings removed from fundamental physical borders . this means that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all kinds of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras operate in the direction of 10 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even though this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result , the optimum for compact cameras . even DSLR cameras have their limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 750@@ GB hard drive will get you today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make anyone responsible for data loss . so protect your data according to a plan and test this backup before you make anything dangerous like re@@ installing your operating system , replacement of disks or res@@ izing disks .
suppose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive daily . if , then one day , a lightning strikes you luck if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget air@@ borne disaster : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous for your data . they normally concern an entire room or the entire house .
therefore , disaster prevention is always a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs to the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above is a frequent reason for data loss despite backing up the panic . if you have a backup which is not available immediately , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a full snap@@ shot at two time points : the complete backup and the last differential lock .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . generates multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such backup has been made . this backup comes to a version@@ ing system closest to the exception that is only get@@ away and not continuous .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have been really changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security via s@@ sh .
backup important images directly after saving them on your computer to a DVD or other optical media .
this procedure allows you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . in the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for each month .

so valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that is about the period of time you really are interested in because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
since the future is un@@ predic@@ table due to your nature , you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate during the time . unfortunately , there is no other way of making a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . however , every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backward compatible . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the issues of the future .
this question should actually be answered by declar@@ ations in this document . use or switch to open standards supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , storage and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the technical expression for the ability to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned scal@@ ability with and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . for * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift it to a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g whether your new disk is detected by the system , but do not hang it .
&amp; dollars ; dd if = / dev / s@@ dc / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ dc , the new record is / dev / s@@ dc &amp; dollar ; Part@@ ed res@@ ize / dev / sd@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the disk in MB@@ it ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 , and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollars ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ ad@@ c@@ 1 # alter the size of travel if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day does not exist any more software to read , then you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly dis@@ appears from the market . you should therefore no longer use it .
PNG has been designed as an open source standard of GIF , but it can store much more . it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per colour channel and full transparency . PNG can store gam@@ ma@@ - and chrom@@ ati@@ city data for improved color assign@@ ments on hetero@@ gen@@ eous platforms .
TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( DE@@ FLA@@ TE ) . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . with some cameras , you can save your images in this format . however , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DNG The Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a licensed and open source format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . DNG has been developed based on the TIFF / EP format and oblig@@ ated to use metadata . a hand@@ ful camera manufacturer makes DNG now available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will also use it some@@ time .
this is possibly one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Bild@@ resource block@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a label technology that allows users to em@@ bed their data into a file itself . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive the original of your photo , mostly in the raw format . however , X@@ MP adap@@ ts as it stores metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems when linking the metadata files and the image file , and as mentioned above , the raw format will be used . therefore , you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything there .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a large range of applications and business models . D@@ CM@@ I &apos;s activities include the work on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ CM@@ I communities and the D@@ CM@@ I work@@ groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard links and educational efforts to achieve a broad acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera editing , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to DNG and save it in your shell archive . this feature is not implemented yet .
for fine @-@ lay@@ ered editing , you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; digi@@ es ; edit , then you should add the metadata once more . they may be cut off from the other programs .
protect the edited pictures for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . only export them into web galleries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ kam ; to add a photo to an album you will find a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your Alb@@ end@@ aten@@ bank .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ came ; connect it to the computer , turn the camera to the display mode and turn it off . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
if you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a skill indicator appears at the bottom end and the preview pictures of all photos on the camera are displayed . some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for file association settings for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera .
before downloading the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the page bars properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog displays file properties and photo information that are stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer yet . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the Metad@@ ata tab displays the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer &apos;s notice , GPS , etc. of the image . this information is the same as the metadata header from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or image editing . note that these metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on their computer is the click on the button Download and then download the selection of all . this loads all photos from their camera into one album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; . when downloading , the photos are not deleted and we recommend to check if the pictures were safely downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the desired one with the default selection methods of &amp; k@@ de ; select the download button and then download the selected . the selected button will be downloaded as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New is available . these images have not yet been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ kam ; downloaded . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , of course only the new pictures are downloaded .
the list of existing albums is displayed in the My albums section . the list of existing albums is displayed in the My albums section . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; nbsp ; loads the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once by removing the Del@@ ete All . if you want to delete only a few , you will need to select it first and then delete the selected delete .
please note that there is no way to restore photos that you have deleted from the camera . so you should carefully check if the photos were successfully deleted in a &amp; digi@@ shot ; album downloaded before you delete them from the camera . if you want to completely er@@ ase the camera , you should do this via the camera , as this is much faster .
cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos often not particularly meaningful names . the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually recycled after the photos are deleted from the camera . this can lead to dup@@ licate fil@@ en@@ ames if you upload photos of different recording studios to the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time in which the picture was taken to integrate into the fil@@ en@@ ames .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mir@@ r@@ oring the image and for date @-@ based cap@@ tions . if you use this latter option , you will automatically create a folder per day .
the options Wh@@ ile the commit opens three more options that are executed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two affect the data about the author in the section Standard Aut@@ onom@@ ty . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the Ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date and time for all downloaded images .
for example , if you wish to use a different date format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo % Y@@ - % % d % H % H : % M : % S . switch on the option date &amp; time . for further custom@@ ization , you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time .
if you use the option camera fil@@ en@@ ames , you have the option to change the file names in lo@@ wer@@ case letters . or in upper@@ case if you prefer this .
the new file name , the &amp; digi@@ kam ; used for a photo , is shown below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time .
&amp; nbsp ; can use all the information on the orientation of the camera to the time point of recording to perform an automatic spin during shut@@ down . not all cameras provide this information . in the section Page Metad@@ ata , you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo .
automatic rotation is normally turned on , and if your camera does not supply this information , lets &amp; digi@@ es ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off automatic turning , use the Advanced button and select the automatic turn in the bottom of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available , it can create sc@@ anned images in the target album . all images with the same date are loaded into the same album . not all cameras provide this information . in the section Met@@ a data you can read which information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is normally off , and in this case it stores &amp; digi@@ es ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to disable this option . use the Advanced Fol@@ der option and select the date @-@ based under@@ age option at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to download photos from your computer to their camera is the download button . select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ kam ; you where the images should be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the folder you want and press OK to start up@@ loading . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this refers to a position indicated in length and width gra@@ ds and which can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian GL@@ ON@@ AS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area through automatic recording of GPS data . environment planners , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this capability .
if you have later forgotten where exactly the photo was made , you can open a browser that displays the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ shot ; users wanting to locate the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is well to store the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields such as direction , saddle and map references . so the question is actually more about how the data comes into these fields ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the correct hardware , via post @-@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical mapping ( manual ) and last about manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS recei@@ vers . either as card module or by transferring the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS Interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR Ric@@ oh Pro G3 Sony
downloading of GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ one or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you must store these data in g@@ px format as this is the only format supported by the module to the ge@@ ographic mapping .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and from the GPS . on the following page you can make the same as &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ ati@@ tudes or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the characters provided by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ g@@ le.com does not show European road maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
the setting dialog is divided into eight pages . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left .
select action can be set to set @-@ up preview or start editing . you set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; set when you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written to the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option is selected when downloading from the camera interfaces .
author title is a syn@@ onym for fas@@ cia : this field should be the professional name of the photographer . this can be labels such as employed photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a more detailed description of the author , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for vendors : use this field to give the photo . this does not have to be the author if this is a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organisations should be registered here as this is the picture to others &amp; quot ; offer@@ en@@ quot ; . if the image is a stock photo , then the group or agency that provides the image will be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC field . this ensures that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . these metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported in &amp; digi@@ kam ; imported without lost .
save image cap@@ tions as embedded let@@ tering ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the labels embedded in the pictures . this allows you to read your cap@@ tions from other image viewers .
the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse cursor is in the main window above a file . depending on the chosen option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ came ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ als ; to display , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . any file in a &amp; digi@@ kam ; album folder that has none of these extensions , von &amp; digi@@ kam ; ignored .
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the button Update on the right of each category .
some images have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . some images have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole image size lad@@ en@@ quot ; you should only use on fast calcul@@ ators . if you have one , then you can hereby obtain better view results .
by default , the image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select them here . you can turn off the toolbar if you use the image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dar@@ ker or light color in the picture . these colors are set here . in the image processing , this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
chro@@ ma @-@ sub@@ sampling is meant that images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in color information . please refer to this article in Wikipedia for the closer explanation .
with the setting pn@@ g compression , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce image quality as PNG requires a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . the only effect is that the image data requires more time for extrac@@ ting and un@@ packing . if you have a fast machine , you can set this value to a high compression .
with the option TIFF files comp@@ ress you can switch the DE@@ FLA@@ TE compression algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of TIFF images . it does not affect the image quality as the DE@@ FLA@@ TE algorithm works loss @-@ free .
when you select loss @-@ free JPEG @-@ 2000 files , you can save loss @-@ free . even if you select the loss @-@ related setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is much better than normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , metadata was not yet supported , but was in the planning .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image editing was just an image viewer for photos . at present , it is very fast becoming a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing .
the standard acceptance is that all green pixels are equal . if the straight @-@ line green pixels of the CCD sensor react to sensitive to ultra@@ violet light , this difference creates a grid pattern in output . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option marks the image a bit soft , but elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . standard it is a solid color balance based on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images get more details in the top lights in four steps . for other cameras , this option is ignored .
the standard is it the top lights , so the parts of your images are the burned @-@ in , because of the in@@ ability of your camera to capture the top lights as a continuous white . use the setting continuous white in the settings . the setting colours dis@@ solve some unusual results , since they display the top lights in various ros@@ aries . last@@ ly , you can try to recon@@ struct some parts of missing information from the top lights .
this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red . &amp; nbsp ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to recon@@ struct the missing green and red portions out of the still un@@ saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question how much color or white you want .
if you select the option to recon@@ struct the option , you get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can / should be adjusted individually for each picture .
set the lumin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing . to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the sub @-@ ro@@ h@@ data , which have many cameras and which provides a matrix of color pixel . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or color structure .
and D@@ cra@@ w gives you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like this . V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm that was used by D@@ cra@@ w .
if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for color correction , since it is done during the raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions like this should be returned . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information such as color information from one color space to translate to the other so that the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions when an image is opened in the Image Processing / Image management module with raw files .
color Profile folder View the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ic@@ c or / home / user / .@@ color / ic@@ c , in which you save all your profiles .
settings of ICC profiles you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be depos@@ ited . everything can be changed when opening the raw file .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here only your pictures are color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain color@@ tone mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma does not cor@@ re@@ cts for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you must perform the mapping of the mapping itself .
there are other options such as the Soft Pro@@ of profile , with which you can em@@ ulate how your image would be returned from one device . this is very useful before you print a picture since your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore can work very saturated . this could be manually corrected , rather than rely on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras , it is pretty obvious which colour profile is intended for what it is intended for . unfortunately not in the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is of course in@@ official :
the Canon profile extension leaves the style for the goal : F for an exact style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image editing . by deplo@@ ying this interface &amp; digi@@ comes ; many modules support , which were written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use , and they are then loaded by &amp; digi@@ kam ; load these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Short@@ cuts .
for more information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can get through the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper kno@@ b adju@@ sts the time between the picture transi@@ tions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other cross @-@ fields turn the metadata on or off , which are displayed at the bottom of the pictures during the display .
the camera properties show a list of all the currently supported cameras on the left . on the right top there is a button automatic detection that attempts to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is properly connected , switched on and in the image display mode . among these are the port settings . currently , serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage is supported .
at the bottom you can set the path for USB@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( IEEE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you need to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , on which you mount your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ es ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , put it in the display mode and turn it on .
check out if &amp; digi@@ kam ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the main window &apos;s cameras . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; pictures to the tr@@ ash@@ can , you can set the conversation of &amp; digi@@ kam ; setting a photo in an album . in the del@@ e@@ tion of a photos and del@@ e@@ tion of an album you will find more details .
the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly controlled by &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise , you have to save changes with the button changes .
you can also disable the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ kam ; disable it when starting . this acceler@@ ates the starting process of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
the setting to search for new photos forcing &amp; digi@@ es ; to search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the starting time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . if something from the base folder has been deleted , asks &amp; digi@@ kam ; you , if it is to delete it from the database .
different color schemes can be in &amp; digi@@ kam ; used to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected in Settings Design from the toolbar . a preview of the available designs will be listed below :
these designs have been defined in plain text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find more information about this in this tutorial .
you can use this to view your photos and to edit and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of previ@@ ew@@ ing and selecting the entry Display / Edit .
the image editing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam ; so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see the Image Processing section .
a status bar at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current file number , enlargement factor and the current image size indicates .
a menu bar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently needed functions .
the editing functions of the editing process change your photos . none of the functions will change the original photo before using File Save or button Save from the toolbar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image .
so you should possibly make a copy of your image before changing it . you can save it using file Save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the File Recovery menu or the button The button re@@ produce re@@ produce in the toolbar . you then lose any change you &apos;ve done at the photo since the last saving .
virtually any action of image editing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by selecting or restor@@ ing re@@ productions from the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should use the short@@ cut keys , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to undo and C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to re@@ produce .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press the Re@@ production or restore button in the toolbar for a moment longer , you will receive a pop @-@ up menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions will also be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar , image high , picture down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes in the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save it .
in the photo you can zoom in and out in which you use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : select a magni@@ fying factor automatically
view full screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you come to the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . normally , you can change this in the settings dialog by &amp; digi@@ kam ; change it . you can view it from the &amp; digi@@ kam ; main window . see the section for setting up image editing .
if you want to print the current image , you can select the image from the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can customize the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print single images or whole sets . whole picture preview pages can be printed from your selection . you just need to select the pictures with the standard methods and select from the menu album Export printer wiz@@ ard . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you just need to make your choice .
the main window has a side bar at the right edge providing important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation arrows , even in image editing . it will display when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicks on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear again .
the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the labelling is copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC fields so that you can use other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are trun@@ cated after 2000 characters and special characters are converted . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label field in other applications , you should note these limitations .
after you have commented on it , use either the App@@ lic@@ ator button or simply switch to the next image , the lab@@ eling will then be saved .
besides the App@@ ly button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata to the files . however , this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written into the images .
the app@@ rais@@ al section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate several images at the same time , select it and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field . the encoding follows the scheme in the following table :
the key@@ word view displays a search box for filtering the keywords , the key@@ word tree and a selection box with previously used key@@ word keywords .
the key@@ word tree is dynam@@ ically adjusted to the entered search word . you can limit the number of possibilities in search of a key@@ word quickly . this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is another relief when entering keywords in a picture series . if you have entered different keywords , they are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set by marking the appropriate cross @-@ fields in the tree . all keywords of a picture are stored in the key@@ word IP@@ TC field .
if you select multiple images in the main view and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not on the entire selection , if you want to provide a key@@ word , please refer to the key@@ word section .
the side bar key@@ word filter is used to change the selection of images shown in the main window . normally , the left side bar is used with their album , date , key@@ word and search views . if one or more key@@ word filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all er@@ ect keywords are available .
if the key@@ word already exists , you can simply pull it out of the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . then a dialog appears asking you if you want to put the key@@ word .
in the upper example , the main window displays the images on a calendar tag . the key@@ word filter is on no keywords , which reduced the amount to three images . you have been selected with C@@ trl + a and then a key@@ word from the right key@@ word tree has been selected and stored there . a dialog asks if this key@@ word should be set .
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be switched off under Settings Mis@@ cellaneous .
if you have a rule with and created and find that it should be one or more , you can easily change this by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string , which is already set in the database .
you can , for example , set an Advanced search on all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you just need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button group@@ ing . the options then look like this :

the reason why one uses a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that have actually been photograph@@ ed or sc@@ anned from your camera or scanner . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are identical to those of your camera or scanner and the colours you print or publish in the web from your digital dark@@ room .
when the topic comes to color administration , everyone wants to know which buttons it needs to press for the results it wants . unfortunately , color administration means that you make informed decisions at any point in the image processing work@@ flows . the sense of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color administration . in addition , links with deeper information allow you to make your own informed decisions to make you get the desired result .
if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about colour management .
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
your only other image issues are by email or web , where s@@ RGB is the de fac@@ to standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life easier for everyone , why should one use another colour gam@@ ut to think about colour management ?
a visual example of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors we can see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all the colours we can see , the hu@@ gely shaped region , and the colours in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excellent page and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I need to cal@@ mer my monitor if I chose to work only in s@@ RGB color space ?
yes ! whether you are working in the s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to cal@@ mer your monitor , since s@@ RGB indicates that your ; on@@ itor closes the circle . if you work as in the color space of s@@ RGB , you either need to cal@@ li@@ ar your monitor to the s@@ RGB @-@ standard , use a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attemp@@ ting a further manual processing .
the functions Norm@@ alize , Compare , Automatic setting and contrast extend from the Cor@@ rec@@ t Automatic correction automatically try to make the best from your colors . you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scale the lumin@@ ous values over the entire image so that the dark@@ est point is black and the bri@@ ghtest spot as bright as possible without changing its shade . this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or balanced .
same : this method adju@@ sts the brightness factor of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible . sometimes the same has very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only gar@@ bage . it is a very powerful operation , which causes either miracles in an image or it destro@@ ys it .
automatic balance : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright limit tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram area .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the wid@@ est possible range and a new ji@@ b of all values in between . this is only visible in balanced pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is somewhat limited with a color space with 8 @-@ bit per colour . so if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can perform the white balance in the blank mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , so your possibilities for correction will fail .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm of the cop@@ yri@@ ghted by P@@ aw@@ el T. Joch@@ ym . you start it via the menu entry colors white balance of image editing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side both the original image and the preview of the target picture can be seen . the preview is dynam@@ ically adjusted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance , then it is enough to click on the thumb@@ nail .
thumb@@ nail preview features a red marker . the L@@ umin@@ ancy of the pixel below this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
to the right , a hist@@ ogram shows that dynam@@ ically changes as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lighted images , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow adjustment lets you improve the sh@@ ading details of your photos or also dim down .
to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . in this way the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of pres@@ ets . the following settings are available :
the over@@ supply indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. They will get the combined result displayed in the white balance . this is displayed in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons save as and load exactly this . each setting of the white balance that you have set can save you with this in a text file and then load it later .
the Pre@@ ferences button sets all filter values back to their default values and their neutral white balance . note that also neutral settings will result in another photo than your original . if you save them your original image will be changed .
you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image . 8 @-@ bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit encoding is better for high @-@ quality images . however , this encoding also requires more disk space , calculation time and is only available for the formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and DNG .
this tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . colour mapping can be carried out by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed guidance on how to use color profiles allows you to consult the chapter color administration .
another important tool is to find color correction in the menu . this tool provides an integrated path to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously and allow you to use your settings so that you can use them for several photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner will always need the same correc@@ tions .
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure sheets is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under color gra@@ dation in the menu .
das &amp; digi@@ kam ; die Far@@ be@@ ff@@ ekte presents you four color effects , a solar process effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , solar @-@ ization , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect that emerged if you switched off a partially developed pressure a short flash light and afterwards completed the development of the image . this had the effect that the bri@@ ghter areas dar@@ ker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illumination . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controls the solar energy . at about 50 % intensity the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase creates a negative image that is not to be produced on phot@@ op@@ aper .
this is an example of the solar process effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it simple , it em@@ bel@@ li@@ fies many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and there@@ with a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contra@@ sts . the characteristics make it a film of choice for nature photographers . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated colors are also some photographers , especially those that clear no landscapes , too much .
the Ne@@ on@@ filter simul@@ ates Ne@@ on@@ light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider re@@ peti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . in large images , the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the photos . you can for experim@@ enting the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your alignment can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result you use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
when you make a photo in poor lighting conditions , you can get the reverse issue : a too large satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous thickness / contrast / g@@ amma is the tool tuning correction based on the improvement of the exposure . even if the dialog for this tool works very complicated , you need only the range of sli@@ ders for the purposes described here . concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph , three sli@@ ders can be cli@@ cked into and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the kno@@ b and take care of how the picture changes .
on the right side , the original and preview of the picture can be seen . the preview will be updated dynam@@ ically , based on the settings of the picture . on the left side , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box it is possible to set whether the hist@@ ogram is represented with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y @-@ axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is more useful .
three kno@@ bs : the upper@@ most for the dark notes , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle sounds , often called g@@ amma values .
the three colour pin@@ ettes can be used in preview the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows , middle and light tones . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controls that can be used to inter@@ actively modify the output values as in the input values .
automatic : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and Load : with these buttons , the set values can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later . to do this , the Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color p@@ ettes , the input values are automatically read@@ ju@@ sted for all shadows , medium and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the over@@ supply indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only displayed in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you see an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) .
the left side shows half of the original and the target image . the preview will be updated dynam@@ ically depending on your settings . the following options are available on the right @-@ hand side :
modi@@ fier channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel that is changed by the module :
in addition to this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for images recorded with a digital camera is mostly the linear mode of the most useful . for images with large areas of a constant color , the linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode continues .
for example , if you shift a curve part to the right , for example the bright tones , you can see that these bright tones correspond to dar@@ ker output tones and dar@@ ker to dar@@ ker the corresponding pixels .
on the preview of the original photos is a red marking to see . if you want to change this selection to the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and Download : with these buttons , you can do this exactly . each curve that you have created can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later . the file format for this is Gim@@ p corn@@ ering format .
if you create this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes automatically the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original picture to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the over@@ supply indicator control controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you will see the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only displayed in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun tones have been set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ es ; image editing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photo .
the channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel bl@@ ender of image editing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first hint how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and r@@ ash . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed as a comparison of your own tab .
viewing the target image features a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line will appear in the hist@@ ogram to display the corresponding color value .
controls for the module are right down : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate L@@ umin@@ ance , the picture will retain the general brightness , even if you activate the appropriate color component . this is especially handy if you also enable the option Mon@@ ochro@@ me , since the channel mixer is then THE tool to generate great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color will result in a visible noise coming from the colour space . color brau@@ schen consists of small noise art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear in the same place in the color channel and their sound pattern in each channel looks different . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion by reducing the color space first .
the Save as and Shop buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any bl@@ ender setting can be saved for later and then load . the file format used is the Gim@@ p channel bl@@ ender format .
the over@@ supply indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only displayed in the preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been read@@ ju@@ sted . the option L@@ umin@@ ancy Store is enabled . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstr@@ action . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , as color images can be easily converted on the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white file si@@ gh@@ ting with a green lens filter . this looks great , with all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange @-@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white fil@@ ming with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange @-@ filter .
Rot@@ Filter : simul@@ ates a black / white file si@@ gh@@ ting with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simul@@ ate lun@@ ar phases during the day time . so similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white fil@@ ming with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow gel filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : produces warm light and middle tones as it adds a bit of cold into the shade . this is very similar to the process of a print and re@@ development in a sep@@ ia oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and therefore similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
using the &amp; digi@@ comes ; apply tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to an image .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can let it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a m@@ ural on a wall .
relief : move this parameter to the right further increases the appearance of the depth or the three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the image .
a paper text effect has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
using the &amp; digi@@ comes ; add tools frames can be added a decorative frame around an image .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one possibility to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to the sc@@ atter@@ ing eye .
type : with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image . the picture with a coloured line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce str@@ anded it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , sh@@ kant@@ et surround it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a but@@ ton@@ fire effect and decorative insert a decorative frame with patterns .
width : indicates the width of the frame in percentage . the range of value for the width is from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image decorated with the frame will be bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important to print the pictures , especially if you have used the tool to cut the aspect ratio before .
with this handy tool , you can insert simple a format@@ ted text in an image at any position . this also works in several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply insert the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; OK . &quot; once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; edit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tool , you can apply a template to a template . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the menu image template can be used in image editing can be used to put templates over a picture .
for the template , there are no limitations regarding size and orientation . however , you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to shrink the file size of the template . if you want to add your template of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; st@@ encil database , simply send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ kam ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your st@@ encil folder with the base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the st@@ encil files . these settings are marked for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the st@@ encil folder . the selection of a folder automatically updates the templates preview toolbar .
below you will find three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and position of your image .
enlarge : this button increases the image below . it is cent@@ ered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
smaller : this button res@@ izes the image below . it is cent@@ ered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to res@@ ize the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below . to do this , take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be automatically adjusted to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides three different tools for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but produced especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny pictures .
bl@@ ur mask works at the contrast of the edges to let a picture look shar@@ per . actually , it doesn &apos;t shar@@ pen it a bit , it works more psych@@ o @-@ visual . you can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ st and it makes here a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is cop@@ yri@@ ghted by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment .
photos without focus as well as most digi@@ ti@@ sed images need correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because the digi@@ ti@@ zation process needs to summar@@ ize colors with minimal differences to a color point . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras normally require more consequ@@ ential sharp@@ ness than normal cameras for private users .
with JPEG images a camera is often used for internal sharp@@ ness . images in the raw format , on the other hand , must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during processing .
some sc@@ anners use a focal depth during reading the image . if you disable it , you will get control over your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo using the sharp@@ ness tool . you can use the menu entry Cor@@ rig@@ ate sharp@@ ness .
you should be careful with this because the results do not work very naturally : the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but ampli@@ fies the noise . generally , the most useful technique for shar@@ pen@@ ing an image is re@@ focusing . you can re@@ focus it via the menu entry Cor@@ rig@@ ate . under re@@ focus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the image a bit soft is much easier than to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sof@@ ten sof@@ tw@@ ood with the menu entry Cor@@ rig@@ ate sof@@ ten@@ ers and experiment with some settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog will show you the effect on your photo .
the filter is bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . you can see a demonstration here .
the original image and the preview help to edit the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should be tried first . an increase of the radius or the amount increase the effect . if you make the bl@@ ur mask too strong , smo@@ kers and the impression of gr@@ ates are produced near sharp edges .
the radius shows how many pixels on each side of a channel are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . you should therefore shar@@ pen images best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ ped image which is added to the original . this will set the strength of the sharp@@ ness .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference in difference . thus , one can thereby define a minimum difference thus for a chann@@ eling of the filters . in this way , areas with a soft switching between the tones are excluded and hence beauty errors in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of the un@@ sharp mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited picture the ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 .
das &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool re@@ dire@@ eren re@@ foc@@ usses an image by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the cop@@ yri@@ ghted de@@ ple@@ tion filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese filtration . the traditional technique for shar@@ pen@@ ing images is the use of a bl@@ ur mask . re@@ focus usually reaches better results than bl@@ ur@@ red . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing colors in image editing .
in practice , the circular folding is much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s attitude . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which leads to this the mathematical result also depends on the source pix@@ ies that are far from the original square pixel . in most cases , the FI@@ R Wiener In@@ verse der Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding is even very strongly affected by the remote pixels . it causes unwanted results .
circular focal point : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should result in 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image should be very bl@@ ur@@ red but then pay attention to hal@@ o .
cor@@ relation : an increase in the cor@@ relation can help reduce arti@@ facts . the cor@@ relation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0,99 . a high value for the cor@@ relation reduces the shar@@ pen@@ ing effect of the module .
noise filters : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad . an useful value is 0.@@ 03 .
Gau@@ ß &apos;s edge : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your bl@@ ur is Gau@@ ß . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid anno@@ ying arti@@ facts . if you use a value un@@ equal to zero , you may also need to increase the cor@@ relation and / or the noise filter .
matrix Size : this value determines the size of the matrix . an increase in the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular focus or the gauge &apos; sharp@@ ness . note however that the module will be very slow when you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save as and Lo@@ ading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focuss@@ ed parameters you have set will be stored for later and can then be loaded .
try to do all the tri@@ mming , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the image before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before changing the image . the reason for this is that many operations changes that are not immediately visible , but which leave un@@ comfortable arti@@ facts later .
when you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king produces better results than shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king a larger neighborhood used than shar@@ pen@@ ing .
theore@@ tically , bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king must always create arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of bl@@ ur@@ ring . in practice , the result of the FI@@ R Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is always at least as good as the bl@@ ur mask . the FI@@ R Wiener Filter is often better in processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused image :
the original un@@ sharp color image has to be corrected . this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the field of field error correction , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the regul@@ ator smoo@@ th@@ ness sets the sharp@@ ness of the area of the dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the ink tin@@ ting allows a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set this here .
the tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove not desired art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the algorithm was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS lab in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings fine , you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings .
detail conservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to an even smoo@@ th@@ ness over the picture . weigh@@ ed higher values mainly smooth regions and let details be sharp . a value of 0,@@ 9 should obtain details so that no shar@@ pen@@ ing should be subsequently required .
directional dependen@@ cy Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes ev@@ enly in all directions , while a value close to 1 is smoo@@ thed in one direction . if you have a film body or CCD noise , a high value will produce shaft @-@ like patterns . JPEG arti@@ facts are best removed at a value near 1 .
smoothing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoothing factor via all@@ es. p then defines the relative smoothing . therefore set this value appropriate to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary when a lot of noise is occurring , because it is then difficult to appreciate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
re@@ peti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is going through . normally , here is 1 or 2 .
angle @-@ gradu@@ ation da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is cho@@ osen small , it should also be selected small . therefore , make sure that small angles make a long run@@ time . therefore , you should choose this value as greatest possible and acceptable to your needs .
integrated step @-@ width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integrated step @-@ width in pixels . you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoothing and never greater than 2 .
using linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you get by selecting this option is only slight . it dou@@ bles however the run@@ time . we recommend it to allow it .
the buttons save as and load exactly this . each setting of image error correc@@ tions can be saved to a text file and loaded later .
correc@@ ting image errors is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the Cancel button .
below you can see how image errors are corrected with little art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is used on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you see , there is a peculi@@ ar black art@@ ef@@ act in the foreg@@ round that caused by a bad film storage during the trip . the original image is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise . it uses a cop@@ yri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove st@@ ains and other art@@ ef@@ acts which occur e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information on sensor noise from digital cameras , you can check it in English in this tutorial .
the scre@@ enshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the details pane and the Advanced Settings window can remain in default settings .
radius checks the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time required for the filter per pixel and can bl@@ ur the image . the area indicated by the radius is smoo@@ thed over the image and the color in it is smoo@@ thed and therefore smaller errors .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness of the pixel . this value sets the pixel pitch that the filter looks forward to as@@ certain light density changes . if it is increased , noise peaks are reset . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter picture details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubrication will res@@ ume .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , not the entire noise can be removed or diamond sp@@ ik@@ es can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG image file without losing any details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend either changing color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend either changing color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma @-@ tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dar@@ ker areas , which are typically more screw@@ ed up .
atten@@ u@@ ation : controls the adjustment of the phase j@@ itter@@ absorption . this value defines how quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius respon@@ ds to variations of the lumin@@ ance . when it is increased , the edges appear smoo@@ ther when it is too high , noise and phase j@@ itter appear at the edges . it can remove rough peaks and is the recommended method for it .
save and load : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be saved to the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction has been applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . fortunately , the solution to draw the image a bit soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use this tool to sof@@ ten sof@@ tw@@ ood with the menu entry Cor@@ rig@@ ate sof@@ ten@@ ers and experiment with the smoo@@ th@@ ness . the preview window on the right side of the dialog displays the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove taste , movie gra@@ ding , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that appear in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images . the smoothing takes place along the image con@@ tours and thus preser@@ ves the content as it does the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for color and texture mapping . the texture mapping is performed using another tool , the image error correction . the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS lab in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ nec@@ y and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts Redu@@ ce : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a low @-@ loss compression algorithm , it generates some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ak@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
each setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish .
the module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ si camera on a Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film @-@ gra@@ ding on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures were applied to an old color photo that was read with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts caused by the scanner illumination and the photo paper . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the Hot@@ pixels tool allows hot@@ pixels of photos to be removed with a CCD camera , eight have been removed . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pix@@ i project , which are cop@@ yri@@ ghted by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos because many cameras with JPEG compression feature a built @-@ in re@@ pression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pixel quot ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel .
download this file into the wiz@@ ard with the Dark image button . the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important to record the dark image directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixel by CCD Def@@ ects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the right dark@@ picture to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixel . note that the wiz@@ ard will remember the last dark image and automatically re@@ charges it in the next session .
the image area and preview help you to correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all preview areas .
select an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
the result is an average of the neighbour pixels . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square finish ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square ben@@ ds ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , applied from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) .
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; Vig@@ net@@ ting Cor@@ rection is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image .
wide angle lenses , especially the medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ ep@@ hot@@ s may also show this behavior .
many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aper@@ ture filter , which allows the necessary sh@@ utter speed to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also use center filters , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller , since otherwise un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing effects are caused by movement .
with the large exposure ranges of today &apos;s film and gra@@ dation of digital cameras and film scanner , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a c@@ enter@@ filter by applying an equivalent transformation to a raw image that was made without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting Cor@@ rection is turning the transformation with a cent@@ ric filter on a picture . the algorithm is cop@@ yri@@ ghted by John Walker .
with three regul@@ ators you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting Cor@@ rection Filter and with three further exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light @-@ strength atten@@ u@@ ation at the point of greatest density the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which corresponds to an optical filter with an aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly a light intensity of 2 , correspon@@ dingly , reduce the density to compens@@ ate for a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree .
lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vi@@ vi@@ fic correction reduces the brightness of pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the image with these options . you only have to adjust the exposure of the image , since you only need to increase the settings .
if you want to fine re @-@ adjust the exposure of the target image , let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction applied to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ vi@@ ties in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture . a lumin@@ ous and contrast correction was also carried out in the picture with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ um ; lens distor@@ tion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a cop@@ yri@@ ghted algorithm developed by David Hod@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric distor@@ tions . coloured distor@@ tions can not be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree covers the general geomet@@ rical distor@@ tion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s on the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient fourth degree cor@@ re@@ cts the distant corners opposite to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ rical distor@@ tion can be almost eliminated .
general : this value controls the strength of distor@@ tion second degree . with negative values t@@ onn@@ en@@ ical distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distor@@ tion .
corner : this value controls the strength of distor@@ tion fourth density . this value has a stronger effect on the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses the &apos; corners parameter &apos; has the opposite call@@ sign of the general .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and thus leads to a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive image size decreases .
bri@@ gh@@ ten : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values they raise .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog box illustr@@ ates the distor@@ tion correction . the values you use for your image are stored and used as default values at the next start .
the t@@ onn@@ age or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed prior to all cutting or size changes . the best way to re@@ produce this correction is the first . if you have to cut a picture and then perform a barrel @-@ shaped correction , the effect would appear apparent to fal@@ seh@@ ood .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal help line . move the mouse cursor in the image preview to display the dotted lines . move it to an important place , such as the edge of the sea or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point .
if you correct a cushion distor@@ tion , the resulting picture will have black corners . you can remove them using the cutting tool in the Edit menu Edit from the image editing or via the zoom kno@@ b of this dialog .
the next logical step for some motives , such as shots from the front , frames and paintings , is the perspective to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distor@@ tion of the perspective .
this is an example of the barrel @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate the infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 i@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rec@@ t@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview you can set two parameters for movie gra@@ ding and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the option Add movie gra@@ dation when you want to simul@@ ate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO kno@@ b changes the amount of film gra@@ ding and domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white as snow !
since the filter mix@@ es color channels for re@@ producing infrared film , especially the Green Channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos because colour information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared fil@@ me@@ zer applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited picture below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a type of au@@ ra in the top lights .
the &amp; digi@@ shot ; Fil@@ ming Fil@@ ming is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool for re@@ producing film particles on your images . this is known by classic high @-@ speed movies such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers mix large silver grains of photo emul@@ sion .
the film body effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image gets rid of a timeless ambi@@ ance from daily life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , street photography , gra@@ iny view especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you need to use this filter .
the regul@@ ator can calibr@@ ate ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ularity of the grains . the default value is , although frequently higher values are needed , set to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film production effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ um ; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright @-@ protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
der &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter of oil paintings gives your digital images a nice appearance like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
the top sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . th@@ icker brushes are better for large images . fl@@ atten the smoo@@ th@@ ness or , from the other side , the hing@@ es .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the editing is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 Pixel large picture is 1 and smoo@@ ther 17 .
the lines that define the outline in drawing are emphasized . pictures whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you have chosen to outline yourself . this would be good images to start with it .
there are two regul@@ ators with a range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regul@@ ator cho@@ oses the pen size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smoo@@ ther ) .
this is an example of the carbon label . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed picture ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
der &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter engraving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a cop@@ yri@@ ghted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the filter engraving is a fast tool to re@@ produce your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works especially well in pictures with a simple structure , in which colour is not the most important of the contents . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey , mon@@ ary landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the edited picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of distor@@ tion effects . it uses cop@@ yri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and make it look like it is viewed through glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog@@ ous to the wav@@ e@@ blocks 1 the image is dist@@ orted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Finish .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using bl@@ ur@@ ring effects . it uses cop@@ yri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom bl@@ ur : wi@@ pes the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a central point . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al bl@@ ur : wi@@ pes the image through rotation of the pixels by a central point . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a turning camera .
distance bl@@ ur : wi@@ pes the image to create the effect of a non focused camera lens . the object seems to step back into the background .
motion bl@@ ur : wi@@ pes the image through horizontal moti@@ ons of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph , camera .
sof@@ ten@@ ing bl@@ ur@@ ring : wi@@ pes the image sof@@ tly into the dark and strongly in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton Eff@@ ect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ am@@ our photos or to add a warm and subtle light .
sh@@ aking bl@@ ur : wi@@ pes the image through random displac@@ ement of pixels and thus simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of an arbitr@@ ary moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur@@ ring : finds the colour bas@@ ins in the picture and wi@@ pes it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it , by filling with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button Finish .
the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es on your picture . this gives natural your pictures a wet appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n cop@@ yri@@ ghted algorithm .
dro@@ ple@@ t size allows to change the size of the drops . because the dro@@ ple@@ t size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of drops on the picture .
you can keep an area free of reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen with the &amp; digi@@ kam . use the selection tool to choose the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter rain@@ drops , the area will remain free of reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen .
this is an example of the Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen Fil@@ ters . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the edited picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it into the correct orientation by mirrors or turning . you can find the tools in the Transformation View or Trans@@ form mirrors .
photo blowing is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom in a picture when the limits of resolution are reached ? how can you re@@ inv@@ ent or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job here . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose to change the size in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is shown below .
the tool to change size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approxim@@ ate pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality then try the tool to infl@@ ate .
many image editing programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo infl@@ ates was developed by I@@ MAGE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS labs in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New size and are listed below :
maintain aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary when a lot of noise is found , because it is then difficult to appreciate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
the buttons save as and loading are used exactly for this purpose . each st@@ amping for photo can be saved as a text file and loaded later .
blown photo is very fast for what it does , but it can take a long time and load a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish .
you can see below an example for photo infl@@ ating by enlar@@ ging a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard magni@@ fication .
the cutting of a photo is not only a frequently performed operation but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together a picture . to trim a photo you just have to create the rec@@ t@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag@@ ging the rec@@ t@@ angle . you &apos;ll see this rec@@ t@@ angle while moving the mouse .
if you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by drag@@ ging at the corners of the rec@@ t@@ angle . create a new rec@@ t@@ angle by simply drag@@ ging with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the edit , use the kno@@ b The tri@@ mming button of the editing pane in the toolbar and the photo is cut ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the File Save or File Save button under the File menu to save the newly added photo .
in the preview area , you can change the size of the rec@@ t@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains intact .
cut into the tool After the aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as a portrait format or landscape format . in the high format , the greater value of the height and in the cross @-@ format of the width is assigned .
this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimet@@ res , inches or any other physical size . for example , you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog , there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically .
below in the dialog you can use the Max . ratio kno@@ b the area to cut to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool to trim the aspect ratio stores its settings dependent on the image orientation ( horizontal or vertical ) . if you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are saved as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are saved in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data will reflect the cut image and not the original image .
the settings of the support help enable you to hide aids , so that you can put your pictures better together . these aids are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third rule , harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rec@@ t@@ angle into a similarly harmon@@ ical tri@@ angles at the diag@@ onal .
golden centre : the golden centre is a division of different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaf leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all kinds of things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1,6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it has been used with the ancient Egyptians and Greeks used to construct your tem@@ ples and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division at all times when you put your images , buildings and even photos together to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number deri@@ ves from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1,6@@ 18 the golden centre . a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious .
the golden center provides more liquid auxiliary lines when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
the golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos . compared to the third rule , the golden spiral generates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition results the viewer &apos;s ga@@ ze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow .
a further rule are the rectang@@ les of the golden spiral , also called golden rectang@@ les . this rectang@@ les are used to create the golden spiral . that can be a line or different objects .
the golden tri@@ angles also deri@@ ve from the golden spiral discussed above . their verti@@ ces are the middle points of the sides of the golden rectang@@ les . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equal angles . diag@@ onal to these lines can place a static object dynamic .
when you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can not achieve otherwise .
the options horizontal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic divisions .
with the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast the auxiliary lines can be invisible . this way you can customize the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rot@@ ate a picture to any angle .
when you make a photo , it &apos;s easy for you to keep the camera vertical or horizont@@ ally . this creates an image in which things rot@@ ate around a corner . you can do this with the digital camera ; image editing and the tool free rotation . choose Trans@@ form Free Rotation and adjust the target angle .
rot@@ ate your image with the slider angle . the values on this slider are specified in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button , you can set the slider to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown right above .
for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the cursor in the picture preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after fil@@ ming a picture you will find und@@ esi@@ red tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix this is to use the function transform@@ ieren tri@@ mming from image editing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the Automati@@ cally cut . select one of the following options :
the Anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smoo@@ thes the image a bit after rotation . however , note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tiv@@ al transform@@ ations are performed around a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation into pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation into pixels .
angle left at the top : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
corner right down : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image is slightly dirty . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adap@@ tations generate a double the strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective you get unwanted tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean this is to cut the picture with trans@@ former cutting from the image processing .
the shifting tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite . this is no turning , the image becomes dist@@ orted . in other words , a rec@@ t@@ angle becomes transformed into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module by trans@@ forms sc@@ iss@@ ors .
sc@@ iss@@ ors your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can sc@@ rub horizont@@ ally and ver@@ tically at the same time . if you click pres@@ ets , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will show you and the new dimensions of the target picture are displayed right from the preview area .
for your help , a vertical and a horizontal line appears . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the locking tool to adjust your image .
after you have carried out the she@@ ar , the picture becomes a bit bl@@ ur@@ red . for a single she@@ ar this effect is usually negli@@ gible , but two ch@@ ings generate twice as much inter@@ ruption and therefore you should avoid this .
after the she@@ ar , the image has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate these is to cut the image with trans@@ former cutting from the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . therefore the available formats depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries are compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ kam .
because of this dependen@@ cy of other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF below .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; shows only files in formats that know . this is based on file expansion and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , you can change this list of file extensions the &amp; digi@@ kam ; accept more information about this .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to select even the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in the Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
image compression is the use of data compression methods on digital images . redund@@ ant information is reduced in order to save image data to a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save losses as specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read from Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful manuals in English . you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter by &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can find further information on how to use modules with &amp; digi@@ kam .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; Supp@@ orts the loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is in &amp; digi@@ kam ; all supported cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats that of &amp; digi@@ kam ; supported :
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam ; knows these formats and will have no built @-@ in possibilities to display or edit movies . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ kam ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings for playback of movies use to start the program for playback .

K@@ IP@@ I module exports a number of images to a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed using Google Earth .
if you change steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can carry out the first four Justi@@ fications with the module white balance .
many tools you need for photo editing are included in &amp; digi@@ kam ; your description follows here .
all image editing tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , soft@@ ness , noise supp@@ ression , re@@ focus , bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king , &amp; etc ; . use a single dialog box that displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; Tex@@ ture user quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current picture . to the left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
ver@@ tically parts without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area displays the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview pane .
the upper area displays the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview pane .
the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper part shows the original and the lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mouse over &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; style : shows preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over@@ - and sub @-@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general setup page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and click on the part of the image from which you want to see the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the side@@ bar properties displays the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo Properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data origin@@ ate from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can press the mouse wheel in or out , or hold it and move it . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to pull up a square . all images within these coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and to select and nam@@ ing colors .
the pall@@ ets that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can apply either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are located in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Settings and hot Custom color and Last Supp@@ orted colors .
in the Di@@ alogue palette , you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or browse the folders to files .
the cursor is displayed as a line in the pallet view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the color next to it . the color is described under the pallet view . here , the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used for sel@@ ections . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor to it . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box is added to the cursor below the button color , the color is inserted from the color chart at the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ written another ; depending on whether the mode is selected over@@ writing . this mode can be set by selecting the check box over@@ writing under the cursor cursor .
a selection that has been created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions Copy , Cut and P@@ aste .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the proportions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line ending character if another color follows . if there are three numer@@ ical values in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as one color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit .
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be drag@@ ged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color selection on the left .
graph@@ s are used in science , in particular in computer science , in particular in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graph@@ s . the programs , which &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; contains , are according to the program author ob@@ sol@@ ete &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ programs with just a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ print@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graph@@ s . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphi@@ vi@@ z ; displays graph@@ s with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; works ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph is in &amp; unique ; the graph is re@@ comp@@ uted and in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; represented )
menu to open the graph@@ s in &amp; ate ; to open or to open the graph@@ s in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; in a &amp; unique ; component to open
loading large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems starting from about 1000 knot@@ s and a h@@ ack to show more than these no@@ des )
further required software : &amp; k@@ graphi@@ ki@@ osk ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for displaying the graph@@ s requires :
the main window displays the opened graph@@ s , each in a separate sub @-@ window . in the beginning , if you start &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer , the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot . in this case , the toolbar contains only the symbol file and the ( empty ) list contains all open files . click the first icon to open the dialog .
after selecting one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the lower screen shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; key ) ;
zoom is limited by factor 10 in both directions . below you can see the maximum size reduction of a graph .
if the file is just changed in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer , the loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph should be rel@@ o@@ aded or whether you want to ignore the change . if you want to change your decision later , you can also make your decision later . if you want to change your decision later , you can change the menu item Settings k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; set up ... , see also .
when you open a graph file outside a running &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; instance , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; instance , or want to display the graph@@ s to be loaded in a sub @-@ window of the current instance .
as with the last option you can save your choice permanently , but these can also be changed retro@@ actively with the setup dialog .
at program start you can open all graph@@ s of your last session again . once again , you can save your choice both as well as change later .
you can also specify how the graph is to be divided into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph , which come on one side , will be adjusted to this page . the aspect ratio is ignored . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled from the respective sections of the graph .
page preview with a graph distributed on several pages without header and with another font
the Renew@@ able Load page gives the option to specify the behavior if a file has been modified on hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore changes ) or ask the program each time .
the page Open gives the option to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; set when a graph is opened outside a current session . you can set a default behavior in this case ( open the graph@@ s in a new window or in a sub @-@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is asked .
the site administration page gives the possibility to specify the startup behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not ) or determine the last session files , or decide to be asked at every start .
the context menu , which normally appears at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; opens up further options :
here you can choose between different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; select layout algorithms . the entries as described on the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z website are :
&amp; dot ; -@@ Algorith@@ m , the standard for directed graph@@ s . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered represent@@ ations of directed graph@@ s . the algorithm places the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge cuts as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for non @-@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s . it produces represent@@ ations according to the spr@@ ing@@ spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Kaw@@ ai algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multiple @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; algorithm creates a spr@@ ing@@ spring model for non @-@ executed graph@@ s . it uses the Fru@@ chter@@ man @-@ pure gold he@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ grid sol@@ ver to treat large and clu@@ stered graph@@ s .

the K@@ IP@@ I module sc@@ ans images provides tools to read and store new images .
this module can be used to read and store new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan pictures : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read pictures of a scanner that supports the San@@ e project or another source such as video streams . to do this you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
when you open the images to scan the images , a dialog will appear which allows you to choose between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to pick the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears in order to select the default value du@@ cr@@ at to select your image accordingly . view the preview and adjust the range to your needs before using the button scanning the image . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find further information .
make sure the window is completely displayed , because some settings may not be displayed otherwise .
after you have pushed the button scanning , you must wait until the scan is completed and the window for setting the options of the image appears . please remember that the type BMP is not compressed and therefore creates very large files . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create by saving the image .
you can create scre@@ enshots after selecting the Import &gt; Screen Del@@ ete menu . a window appears in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the entire desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all its own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so you can view other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ station . if you have selected the entire desktop , only the window will be read under the mouse .
the delay controls how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other work@@ spaces , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there .
after the scre@@ enshot has been made , the dialog for the target image appears with the options described above .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . the geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF key@@ word of the image and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization provides tools to locate images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and width are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data , you need a GPS Track as an XML file in g@@ px format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization cor@@ related . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog appears then . to load a possible cor@@ relation of time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a trace file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains data that were taken at the same places at the same time as the pictures of your camera .
when the file is loaded an automatic cor@@ relation is done which shows coordinates in red . GPS Track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone .
the setting for maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera time . lies the devi@@ ation below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have track data from a location for pictures you can manually edit the g@@ px file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all pictures in this area .
the options Inter@@ poli@@ shing and difference in minutes can be used if you have no matching data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a great time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place . as the dialog is the coordinates of a call to the next you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . select the respective region and enlarge si@@ e.@@ Add this again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the card can be changed between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside of the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ if@@ tool to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a gallery from HTML pages to version 4.0@@ 1 . you can select the albums that should be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four tab@@ s in which the settings can be adjusted . you only need to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML . the albums are not displayed hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the section below will display the Al@@ ben@@ preview and the text that will appear in the top of the HTML page .
the rider &apos;s appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this rider is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . the option for each image to create a page creates a gallery in which each image also gets its own page . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; k@@ ick@@ show , displayed
the tab Album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be stored with all your associated images . for this purpose , select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder containing the name KI@@ PI@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG File format , the EX@@ IF information of your original pictures will also be stored in the new pictures .
with other color depth , you can change the default color depth . naturally , it also influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the thumb@@ nails allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , which are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window indicates the user how far the action is . press Cancel to cancel the process .
when the module has created the pages the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the programs to see if errors occurred while generating . the web browser is automatically started at the end to preview the gallery .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL tool for viewing images .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oms or moves . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse clicks . it has been developed for fast image detection and quick access to its functions .
after the start a picture is displayed in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ free module is a tool to change images without com@@ promising your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the below actions , without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of los@@ s@@ less storage is that the file size increases since no compression of the color information takes place . this can also be found in PNG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool for connecting your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ org. Note : participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I @-@ Module Metad@@ ata Editor does not currently have any documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ DE @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
the Import function of the metadata module allows you to copy data from one image to another . select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function . this will then open the file selection dialog with which you want to select the target image , so the image to which you want to copy the metadata . the data will be copied once you have cli@@ cked the button OK .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write to any target format . JPEG is supported while writing . please look at ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG enco@@ der module is a tool to convert a number of pictures into a MPEG video in the form of a slideshow .
the MPEG enco@@ der module can be used to convert selected images to MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ peg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . between the individual images you can insert a basic image transition . you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slideshow .
all images are sc@@ aled automatically to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the slideshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the images that should be packed into the MPEG Slideshow . after that you can start using Tools MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au to start the module .
the images selected by you are then listed under Image Files in the Portfolio . there you can also modify the images or the contents of the list .
after you &apos;re happy with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ VCD , SV@@ CD and VCD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should specify the time in seconds that a picture is displayed . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value generates very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image change .
the background color can be set next . in case of doubt , you should let it black . you can specify the name and path of the generated file in the name of the MPEG output file . keep in mind as soon as possible .
if you specify an audio file with the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . depending on the speed of your computer you can start drinking a coffee quickly or quietly and enjoy the slideshow when you are back .
if an indication appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can customize the paths to programs of M@@ j@@ peg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick Pack@@ ages via the Settings button on the right .
the Print Ass@@ ist allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve you or print directly with the Gim@@ p module .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original f@@ ake of Him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first select the raw file to convert and start the module . the Ra@@ w image converter window will then appear in mode for a single image . with the Preview button you can preview the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings for the white balance are to be used . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected to allow you to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains the same , and only the extension is adapted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss @-@ related algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it .
the Tagged Image Format , TIFF , maintains all the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you plan to edit your images often or otherwise use it later , you should not choose the JPEG format since it allows only a limited number of operations before the image quality is wor@@ sen@@ ed . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is contained in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file in the ex@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start converting the conversion with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Cancel .
batch Processing Mode allows you to convert different images at once . so use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image which is the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write the existing file automatically . this is helpful if it was created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is progres@@ sing .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used for ren@@ aming all pictures of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can zoom or enlarge the image .
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : res@@ izing in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to customize your image to the screen format .
not proportional : not proportional scale change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
preparation : prepar@@ es the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge and background color , is adapted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the pictures to be sent before .
after you have started the module , the picture window will be displayed with the images you selected . click the Add images to add more images to a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , a preview will be displayed on the right .
you can also drag and drop images to the picture list to add a list of images to be sent .
removing pictures will remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent .
once you have selected all the images , you can use the button OK to open the New message window of your e @-@ mail client . you just have to add the addresses and the subject area . the images you have selected are attached as an attachment .
do not make sure to send too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations to the size of emails to be sent . it may be a good idea to send several mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration will be saved and re @-@ used whenever you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you choose Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in a attached file , the comments to the pictures are added to a text file and attached to the mail .
the PNG format under the File Format File menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to los@@ s@@ less formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and do not need to change the photo quality . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG with image file format and the original files in JPEG format are then the original @-@ ex@@ if@@ data will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so that you can preview the status messages , in search of errors . your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end .
after starting the Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au module , a window will appear with questions like your slideshow . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the Open@@ GL @-@ transi@@ tions option in the presentation enables very elegant image transi@@ tions using Open@@ GL . however , you have to have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the File Name option ensures that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an infinite loop . you can then manually inter@@ rupt it with Es@@ c .
the option pictures random@@ ly sel@@ ects that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not used the order of pictures in the album .
the time distance between the images can be set between the images . 1500 milli@@ seconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect .
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select . by chance , every transition between the pictures sel@@ ects another effect .
during the slide show , you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to switch you .
with this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next image and stop the slide show .
on the left lower edge of the screen you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ org. Note : participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the working surface .
this module uses the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of sub@@ menus , as background for your K@@ DE working surface .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with comments , you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; through these brow@@ ses , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the picture , now in each group , so in people , places and in group keywords entries are present .
in the browser window you can see the categories for which you have entered information as you have provided your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumb@@ nails .
if you press the mouse over the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
when you select another person , only the images shown on which both persons are visible . by this method of selection , you can restri@@ ct the number of images shown by a few thousand images on a few single images .
if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can display thumb@@ nails to view the images of your range .
in the image , each person has the same icon in front of her name . you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , you can save your own preview image for each person . this also applies to places , keywords and other categories that you have defined by yourself . see the picture .
in order to display images in addition to the names , select the button located on the right side of the toolbar . in the appearing context menu you can select which view you want to use for the current category separately . this has the advantage that you can display symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you do not have suitable pictures for your keywords ) .
you must , however , define which image to be displayed for each individual person . in order to do this , you need to select the image view window ( described in more detail ) and then select a categories editor , as shown in the picture . here you can customize the image for the corresponding person . in the view window , you can customize the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and selecting which part of the picture to be displayed or edited .
if you access the Find entry in the main window , a dialog will show you that the dialog for setting the image properties is very similar . you can view this dialog once more .
if you enter a string in the field lab@@ eling or description , the descriptions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to be searched ; the date can either be a part of the total date , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the bottom part of the window , you can browse all images according to certain names as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you do not like to read manuals , but prefer to try different functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick entry , the scre@@ enshots and the intro@@ duc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialogue , select the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try it .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a related HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar is shown here : . as the name implies , this bar displays date @-@ statistics on the images in your database .
the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar indicates another unit . you can switch between the units of years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can preview the displayed entries from the database ( if you select a date , the first picture of this date will be displayed in the preview window ) and also the tim@@ eline displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the Preview pane .
you can also select an area of tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and drag@@ ging the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , so the time data . if you select an area , you will only display images of this time period in the preview view . you can ab@@ ort the selection by clicking on a bar of tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you two ways to create HTML websites with your images . the one is available in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other available as a module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version , which you can create via the menu File HTML ...
before creating HTML pages , you need to make some adjustments . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and goal . in the following , each section is described more detailed .
first enter the title of the title and a description that will contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML sample pages see an example of these settings .
next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file should be created which is visible on the overview page . more information about the export files can be found in .
last@@ ly , you can choose which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid information displayed to the viewer without notice . for example , that all images are from a party . please note that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; currently all images are exported . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from particular viewers .
in this section you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most of the settings are unique , which is why they are not specifically addressed .
at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the pictures . by doing so , those who view your website and own a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no longer download images that have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you have set . so it can browse your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time . if it wants to get a picture bigger it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting , set the different folders and the URL where your site is stored .
it is best to select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first , you need to select the main folder in which all your images are stored . this folder will be stored and automatically added next time . this allows you to select a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol for all future images , for example :
after creating your images , you can check if these are all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser , after the pages are created , started . the URL you set here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not in the final destination folder , you will need to manually copy them to it . so that the import function , see , correctly works , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder where all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings that have just been described have moved all three to base folders or URLs . a sub@@ folder is created in this folder whose name you specify in the output folder .
if you are on a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you may want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . however , if you have already spent a lot of time to add image information , people on the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you need to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not make this work even more .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im -@@ files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are saved with the file or if the file is only a link to pictures . the advantage of storing all images in the file is that you have all the pictures together and that you can pass on this file so independently . the obvious dis@@ advantage is the file size .
you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File menu ... or along with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches for the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are located in the .@@ k@@ im file folder . if the corresponding images are not found , the images of the URL you specified when creating HTML files will be searched . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for export@@ ing images is described , which you can export via the File Export menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im -@@ files . there are three choices available :
with the Automati@@ cally option to copy near the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Automati@@ sch option to copy near the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . as most images are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worth to comp@@ ress the files . if you want this , simply select the option Export file .
the last option of this page is maximum picture size . if you send photos to your friends , you may not want to send the pictures in full size because the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . for example , you can limit the size by saying that each image should be maximum 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File menu item ... select , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; import the exported database as described in .
the wiz@@ ard for import@@ ing consists of four steps . first you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folders the import pictures are to be copied .
it may be that you person@@ alize the category people of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is in your database persons . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialog box , which categories of imported file to be imported and which categories they are in your database .
in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . for example , see the image .
it must be easy to browse and view images : if you look at images , you often want to jump inside different picture groups and see a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual you will take the various steps of ( 1 ) Set@@ ting the information about your images , through ( 2 ) browsing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program to manage your images . however , it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual you talk about pictures , but often this includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; saves all of its information in the index@@ .x@@ ml file in the top folder of its images . it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , such as normal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in C@@ VS , where they want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not@@ ices the folder in which your images are stored and use it again in future starts . if you want to read another folder tree with pictures , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / pictures / index@@ .x@@ ml .
via the menu entry Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... you can go to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , the various settings options will be explained .
on the left you can see six different symbols with which you can access settings of previ@@ ew@@ ing and options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available which you can invoke by pressing the F1 button and a click on the desired option .
it is described as you can define different properties for each image , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as items , animals or albums .
you can see the dialog which is used to edit existing groups . for each group you can select a label and a symbol .
in the section , sub @-@ categories were already mentioned . in the Options dialog you can set up complete member groups , e.g. all members of a group at once in a group , instead of explaining all groups of a member as stated in the dialog .
in the list below you can select the settings you want to set up . in the left side of the window you can select the category you want to configure . in the left side of the window you will find a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares its modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ es and G@@ wen@@ view . this modular system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin Interface . more information can be found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be called over the menu modules . the modules can and are not described in this manual as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but most modules have a help page that you can access via the modules itself .
since the modules are shared by multiple applications together , it may be that the modules were tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; therefore , you should always test new modules with the demo database before you use it on your own imag@@ ery &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; Demo database , you can either use the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . don &apos;t say I would not have warned you !
the applications using the modules via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the dis@@ advantage if you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications order their images in albums : this is an album simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this type of order does not support , it simul@@ ates the order according to albums , so that you can use the features with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
thus simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which is simply the current view , so all images that show you the picture preview currently .
next to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have a list of albums . here &apos;s &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the content of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will be the category you specified in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . for example , if you use the category people , for example , will do &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do so , so if you would have selected individuals and pass it on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog and select the modules you want to load them .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you &apos;ll see a menu and a toolbar at the top . currently , you will see the window with which you can browse your image database . currently , it does not contain a lot of information , as you do not have any information about your pictures .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see each image with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons depicted on the picture , etc . you can set each image individually or for a larger number of images at the same time . if , for example , on all images Jes@@ per is pic@@ tured and all pictures were taken in Copenhagen .
all these notes can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these remarks if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
you can see three lists with a text field by speci@@ fying persons , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; since you will always use them when you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is to shift the images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 people are depicted , you can , so that the names used are moved upwards , the persons can find and assign more quickly .
if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sorting by date under the list .
if you have selected ann@@ ot@@ ations for each image individually , you may want to edit all the selected images and add these images with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case simply click on the above and back buttons , which are located below the thumb@@ nail on the right .
if you have taken several images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item More added entries at once with a comment .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the United States . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as a super@@ group . to show you that it is a super@@ group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the comment di@@ alogs it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub @-@ category . in addition , you can also simply drag an entry to a category and place it there to make it an sub @-@ category of this entry .
you can move the individual elements of the comment catalogue by clicking and Move the boxes that form the top edge of the boxes . you can also make a separate window from a frame by drag@@ ging it out of the window area .
if you have adjusted the appearance of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click the Options ... which gives you the opportunity to save the current structure and appearance of the window .
you can also hide a frame completely . if you want to see this window again later , use the Options ... button and then hide the window . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the images in the browser , you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected images , or any pictures if you have not set a filter . you can see the size of thumb@@ nails by simply drag@@ ging the mouse with the middle mouse button .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be set up as a background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this is displayed in the image viewer . if you haven &apos;t opened a window with a viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and press either the Rem@@ ove button or select Del@@ ete Select from the Edit menu . now the window will be displayed you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; namely images also use without you to have stored on the hard drive . of course , you must have the images stored somewhere , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can view the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard drive .
images in which the right upper corner is cut off are not stored on the hard drive . however , for the images 5 @-@ 9 , however , the thumb@@ nails are present , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can view the preview of these images . however , you can &apos;t view these pictures with the image viewer .
as you see , this function requires that you copy files from the folders and then copy them into . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you want to avoid anno@@ ying your images , please buy a larger hard drive to store all images on it .
in the Pictures menu you will find a sub@@ menu with the name privacy . if you want a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that in the end those are left you want to make for others in@@ accessible and click on current view locks in the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also select all the images that your little sister can see , and select the menu entry All except up @-@ to @-@ date view .
this allows you to specify which images to be hidden in the case of the case . if you give the laptop now your little sister , simply select the item entry images , elimin@@ ating all the images that you have locked . if you want to get the pictures again click on lock .
it is also possible to set a password that must be entered for blocking the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the privacy menu .
please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , all images on the hard disk and on the other can access the password as un@@ encrypted text or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only to those who are using &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to rep@@ el the view of private pictures .
the reason you all have your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours to describe it is natural that you want to look at them some@@ time . for this reason , &amp; photo@@ album ; through an image _ and video viewer . this can start from the preview as described in .
the viewer can see you in . he of course shows the image , but additional all the information you have entered into the image , such as who is on the image , when and where it was made , etc .
if the info box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can simply drag and drop them with the mouse . you can also configure which information to display and whether information should be displayed at all . all of these options are available after right @-@ clicking on the viewer .
if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have loaded several images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and image . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and the end . these functions are also accessible from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ trl key and plus or minus .
a very useful feature of the viewer &apos;s &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the full screen on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer , you can pull in the picture and zoom out . to zoom up , you can simply pull up a rec@@ t@@ angle with the mouse . the minus key zo@@ om@@ izes into the middle of the image . shows how a zoom rec@@ t@@ angle is selected and shows the result of zo@@ oms .
with the dot button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the co @-@ key , the zo@@ oms set , so that every pixel on the screen matches a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos that are in and out with the plus and minus key .
with the turn functions from the context menu , you can rot@@ ate the image . this does not work for videos . you can make notes to the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu .
if you look at images it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you for@@ got to put on the picture . in the moment you can view this Cancel and configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . however , you will probably prefer to mark only the image and view more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark it as well or poor@@ ly while you view one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to see pictures with features while viewing them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a characteristic by pressing the corresponding letter . in view a picture where features A , B and C are set .
as soon as you have set features on your pictures , these are available in your browser . so if you have all the pictures you edit , print or whatever you have selected , just add all of your notes . this is described in . you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in preview view . if you want to display categories in the preview view , then you can add features to the images by simply press the characters for the attribute after selecting the image . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case , you allow &amp; photo@@ album ; to paint on the picture .
the mixture is not stored with the image but in the database . in the way you can undo your painted afterwards .
in order to view the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , select on the painting from the context menu . to exit the painting , simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er , you need to use the program &amp; Pov@@ ray ; not completely master , but the documentation to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; should you absolutely have read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wi@@ re@@ mod@@ ell@@ - views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects simultaneously . but not the object of an already selected object , since all objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu item in the Insert menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following pop @-@ up menu will be displayed to enable you to select the correct position :
del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button context menu , you can remove previously selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to apply these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message is displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and click again on users or reject the changes with Cancel .
if you enter the path to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; enter the user documentation in the Setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object by means of help .
you need the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can preview a preview in the Properties tab .
click Preview in Fe@@ atured View and a small sample of the scene is rendered using the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , tick local .
the screen shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and thereby change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the location for shifts . you can change the shift through drag@@ ging with the mouse inside the entire window .
each object has a level of visibility as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher @-@ level object or as absolute value . objects are displayed only when they are selected or their level of visibility is smaller or equal to the visibility stage selected in the toolbar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement , or if you need another arrangement , you can set them arbit@@ rar@@ ily . you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different configurations .
to anchor a window over or under a present view , drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view . a rec@@ t@@ angle then displays the new position .
to create a new column , drag the tap to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anch@@ ored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange several views on one another , drag the starter in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map line at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement is ho@@ ver@@ ing views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to view a view from anch@@ oring , drag the tap on the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing left in the connector bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the connector bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any point .
the current window view can be saved with View window order ... Save . it will display a dialog in which you can save the window order under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 up to date . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 .
to render the current scene , click on the Ren@@ dering icon in the toolbar or select the scene from the View menu .
a render mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Pov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of render modes from a fast preview to full pictures of the highest quality .
if you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or in the View R@@ ender Mo@@ di menu , the following dialog will be opened :
each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but useful is a name that lets you recognize the features of the mode .
in the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the picture , select the check box section and enter the image section for rendering to the input fields .
in combination field quality , you can select the properties that &amp; Pov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user Refle@@ xi@@ ons illumination . a detailed description of render properties can be found in the user manual page &amp; Pov@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel , different errors can arise . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; uses a technique called Anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of this error . in general , pictures with this property look better .
when you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; Pov@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as a standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super @-@ sampling the adjacent pixels with one . the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively , because every pixel is split again and again and adap@@ tively because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray pursu@@ es a ray of pixels . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixel passes the pre@@ determined threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 will be charged , at a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays each pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the pre@@ determined threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels that are separately pursued and checked for further classification . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is to reduce the creation of noise for the beam process called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you switch j@@ itter@@ ing , alter &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for the quality of the rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light refle@@ x@@ ion is calculated . it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding rays hit no object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Pov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly completed , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; Pov@@ ray , select the menu item import ... and select a file in the dialog box .
currently , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; Not yet the full command set of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; . if error messages or war@@ nings appear when import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import , write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; this adds the source code of the object to the opened text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply mark the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can add source code for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on the help in the Properties tab , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . place the path to your document and the version . support the versions 3.@@ 1g and 3.5 .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. elevation field data ) in the paths to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files not located in the folder of the scene , you also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rec@@ t@@ angle for the field of view in camera view and in the window type identi@@ fier .
you can set the object beginning of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects such as the sphere , you can set the level of detail separately for two directions .
if you cross High level of detail for extended proj@@ ections , all wire @-@ model views are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection . extended proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions to the perspective and vertical proj@@ ections . this property provides a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ ew .
if you cross a wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is represented in a chess board pattern from two sel@@ ectable colors .
when you cross the floor , a floor below the objects is rendered . the floor is represented in a chess board pattern from two sel@@ ectable colors .
when activ@@ ating edge smoothing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value . you can find more details about the parameters in the section R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di .
on this page you can modify existing window orders or create new window orders . the window orders section explains how to create and store window orders .
the combination field Standard window arrangement : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window arrangement when starting the program .
the list of existing window orders displays all existing window orders . you can create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Rem@@ ove button .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name displays all views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created with the Add button and del@@ eting selected views with the kno@@ b .
the position of the new window . with new column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten anchor the window under the existing window , with card card you will get a map view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; Pov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you would like to start without more detailed knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate yet simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on a plane .
but you should carefully consider the following war@@ nings before you compl@@ ain that as a result , you only get a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied for rendering , as a result you get a black picture .
when you do not insert any light sources , your entire scene is in the dark , and you only get a black picture .
if you have installed everything error @-@ free , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar . please read the documentation so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols often , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; start with a simple scene . to follow this guide you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu item Edit Del@@ ete .
this is the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera . this is the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you can see the contents of the view properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; see more details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera is in view of control points with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location .
if you press the App@@ lic@@ ator or the Enter key , the wire @-@ model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result they see the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . for example , you could insert a header ( inser@@ ting end body Qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method of solving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually provides a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as ground :
a good advice : select the layer in the object tree , change the name and then press the App@@ lic@@ ator button or the Enter key . in the object tree the new name is immediately displayed .
the wire @-@ model @-@ view now also indicates the level even though at the moment only as a fin@@ ite plane . if you render the scene , the plane stretches up to the horizon .
if you look at the object tree exactly , you will find that you can fold the entry for the bottom if you click on the symbol + in front of the object . in this case you will see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and displac@@ ement . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene , you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select Shift and set the values as follows :
first select the bottom to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something Sim@@ ple at the moment .
in both cases a dialog opens where you can select how the object should be inserted . please choose the first object . the pigment will then be shown in the object tree . you can change the name in the property @-@ view ( Name = So@@ il Pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview see how the pigment looks now .
of course , the preview of the pigment just shows a matte black material because you can still enter settings for the pigment . keep in mind that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . now , give you the colors for the pigment .
if you see no color on the header and the ball in the preview , just click on the App@@ lic@@ er button and then call the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the symbol , you should get the following result :
of course , these are not the colors that you have expected . here are still more settings necessary . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called Mon@@ ochro@@ me . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more often , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , select single @-@ colored and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
this step should you already be able to perform , as you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball can be created just as simple as the floor :
in view of the object properties , you can instantly change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget the input button or the button App@@ ly ) , so the ball has contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground , as you have shi@@ fted the ground around one unit down@@ wards .
of course , rendering now results in a strange result : as before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . set a suitable material in the next step .
if you have selected the ball you can assign a material now . as already with the floor , give the sphere a pigment as color :
select first object and change the name for example in sphere pigment . click on the sphere Pig@@ ment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values as in the following scre@@ enshots and click App@@ ly or press Enter .
the settings gloss effect and reflection results in partial good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metallic : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; offers . hopefully , you &apos;ve learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a render method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
when you track a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en , the ren@@ derer sho@@ ots hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render is calculated , as this ray is reflected by the objects , and how atmospheric effects such as fog are affecting .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you can also see nothing , the image is simply black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . Pov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and a disk space .
reco@@ vers the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are disc@@ arded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not saved any saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last one @-@ hand commands . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used edit cat@@ chy .
saves the current window order and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
in this menu you will find options for setting up &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the appearance , short@@ cuts and the default behavior .
opens a dialog to change the short@@ cut short@@ cut . you can use this option pre @-@ set short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; change commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up the toolbar . you can use this option tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; add and remove commands .
a b@@ ump @-@ map is a way to pre@@ f@@ use rough surfaces without having to model each b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ ric shape of the object itself .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for both dump map and tex@@ tured map .
basic bodies are simple geomet@@ ric shapes that can be used as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of this base body . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look .
a texture mapping is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis , by applying a picture file as color chart .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a web browser in which you can select images for viewing .
images can be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that you can click on &amp; L@@ MB@@ n , or the Return key .
you can set whether any image should be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , just type the first characters of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right lower corner . if a suitable fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file will be highlighted . you can exit the input field by pressing Return Or &amp; Es@@ c .

in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should indicate the colors with what you want to display in contrast . sub @-@ exposure should display a light color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window from &amp; show@@ foto has a side bar at the right side , giving you important information and actions to the selected pictures . you can also find the same side@@ bar in the image editing . you can view it in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that no longer makes them scan and save images .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images that no longer can scan and save images . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for each image or save the pictures immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images before saving .
you can check the status of support of your scanner at SAN@@ E project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; can be set in the terminal . if this scanner is not open or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog for selecting the scanner will be opened .
the user can select the scanner to be used and press OK to open the scanner . Cancel &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; exit .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options particularly .
to scan a picture , the user can start a scan scan and then select sc@@ an@@ field for the final scan . the preview button is started by the Preview button .
to select the image better , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also set the zoom in such a way that the complete preview fits into the window .
if the image was selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
if before saving a preview is selected in the settings , then the image will appear in a preview window , as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and lie ? en leads to a Cancel and you will return to the main window .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button opens the dialogue with the same name before the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the user can view the image if wished , before saving . in this case the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the way &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; images can be selected . dialogue to save each image opens the dialogue in front of each sc@@ anned image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite should save it automatically with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must select Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are saved with the Save option without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for the dialog for saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... .
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the automatically storing images and is also the proposed name for the image in dialog for saving . the automatically saved image will be counted for a num@@ eric suff@@ ix that is saved every time a picture is saved . the # # # character is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used to store . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; used like all other programs keyboard short@@ cuts . below you will find a list of this short@@ cut and its function . the global keyboard short@@ cut can be set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and set up Global Key@@ s . the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; specific short@@ cuts can be set up by clicking the right mouse button in the player window and select Short@@ cuts ... Select .
you may set up existing multi @-@ media buttons so that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; thus make your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions which are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists browsers and scripts . an example call for the D@@ CO@@ P function break could be &amp; z@@ b ; look like this :
Amar@@ ok supports the command @-@ line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some own command @-@ line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script can &apos;t be executed because of a lack of dependen@@ cy . please check in your script if all the required modules are present and use the dialog so that the user will know why a script is not running .
begin require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a basis for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
using D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in each K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages enable the execution of external programs and commands . for this purpose , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is used . this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this purpose , strings are written to the default input of the script . for this reason , scripts should continuously monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore events even if there is no use for it .
configure Switch the script to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
tr@@ ack@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is su@@ cked . the script could now &amp; b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions , ask for more information about the new piece ( for example the metadata or the piece length ) .
volume Change new@@ Volume Shows a change in volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ iz@@ cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ ag@@ rap@@ tor Cont@@ ains the path to the selected files of the playlist , when a custom menu entry can be cli@@ cked . to add an entry , the D@@ CO@@ P function d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script will use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ customize Menu@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ title ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ated , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to handle e.g. clean@@ up work . this includes storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ ok &apos;s script management can also install script packages that the user and z@@ b ; downloaded from a web@@ server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . we recommend an archive name such as e.g. my@@ skri@@ p@@ t.@@ amar@@ ok@@ scrip@@ t.@@ tar@@ .@@ bz@@ 2 so that the user can clearly see the archive as Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the popul@@ ating amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should ap@@ point your script pack@@ ets correctly .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file per@@ missions :
if your script package is ready , you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and add the link to the Wiki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . you may also search only a very specific title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s Collec@@ ting browser and the quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
perhaps you have already some play@@ lists , but can you never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music based on certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many gen@@ eric USB devices . also , many different audio systems can be used so YOU can choose how to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right thing to re@@ discover your music !
usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should have no difficulties when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report it to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options that can be activated or de@@ activated at compile time with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the comp@@ iling options certain dependen@@ cies must be met so that they can be used . details can be found in the System Requirements section .
activ@@ ates de@@ bu@@ gger symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in developing &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without effort using the Setup dialog . the Setup dialog has several card cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the Player window sh@@ uts the player window in addition to the playlist . if the option is turned off , only the Play@@ list window will be displayed .
use barometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ oo@@ di@@ ally . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning @-@ barometer .
design : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ oo@@ di@@ ally , the color scheme used for the mood barometer is changed .
put voice files to the music files : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ oo@@ d. if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stored ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ oo@@ zun@@ s / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started when a browser is needed .
using other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser that is not in the list above .
save Play@@ list when loading , save the current playlist automatically when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; check this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist at the end .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored .
make up @-@ to @-@ date items visible when changing pieces causes the Play@@ lists window to pause / shut@@ down to keep the current piece in the visible window area .
when changing to the context browser , automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next item is su@@ cked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the section &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; App@@ ear@@ ance &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the section is divided into three parts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Fon@@ ts section , you can set the use of various fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; use fonts for the following range : play@@ lists windows , player windows and context browsers . click Select ... so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog .
by selecting Custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . use the color sel@@ ector activated among them for foreg@@ round and background color .
start playing at the start ensures that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after the program start , playback continues automatically with the piece at the place with which it was stopped at the last end .
setting up the on @-@ screen display allows you to un@@ lock the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is attached , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
using your own colors gives you the ability to customize the O@@ SD Col@@ ors for Script and Back@@ ground . clicking on the color faces opens the dialog for color selection . if O@@ wn colors are not enabled , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de ; colors are used .
the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ card holders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to decide on which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment to appear the O@@ SD .
the card card audio output allows you to select an audio driver from the selection field . some drivers activate even more settings in this tab .
the map collection is used to set all settings for your collection . this includes the folders and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to browse the music files . to insert a folder into the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also includes cross @-@ boxes to adjust how to proceed with the selected folders .
Browse sub @-@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folders to search for music .
monitor changes : enables &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . an incre@@ mental search is also performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all play@@ lists found in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) will be added to your collection . the automatically added Play@@ lists will appear later in the play@@ lists browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the drop down sel@@ ector driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ ql . if My@@ S@@ ql is selected , another device in the My@@ S@@ ql support window is required .
the My@@ S@@ ql set @-@ up is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in calcul@@ ator : the computer is entered on which the My@@ S@@ ql database is entered . after that , the network port is entered , where the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use username : and password : to enter the data needed for connection to the database .
the cart@@ on map last@@ .fm is based on the support for last@@ .fm . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .fm @-@ server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .fm profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .fm website .
send ab@@ sent pieces and refres@@ h the profile : this setting allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .fm profile .
similar interpre@@ ters retrieve : after activ@@ ating this setting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list of similar interpre@@ ters to the each played piece . you can view the list in the context browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .fm profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . see the summary of the functions and the gallery with scre@@ enshots .
Amar@@ ok needs only the package k@@ deli@@ bs and no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the included programs , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a little guide on how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some features such as the O@@ SD assume that your window manager keeps the relevant standards from fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will therefore work , but flu@@ x@@ box will cause difficulties . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because these provide an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will make a mistake in the day lib library . you can locate the file by clicking in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the tag@@ lib developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also hang up the broken file that caused the crash .
most of the times it is because Tag@@ lib is cr@@ ashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this error to the tag@@ lib developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is more sophisticated .
make sure that all libraries used by &amp; Amar@@ ok have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if for example &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , tag@@ lib , but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crash when editing the met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , turn off autom@@ . switch off if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace via email ( the email will open automatically during a crash ) . if this is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the bug is guaranteed .
this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 in the met@@ a @-@ info , but don &apos;t identify them as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ mp@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( Rand@@ om / Return / Dynam@@ ically Play@@ list ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the symbol effects are simply forgotten . this allows you to click on a symbol in some cases up to three times until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , please check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any colored Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok finds the correct version first .
there are some ways . most of the installation problems are most easily clari@@ fied by the help of an expert on your Unix or Linux distribution . they can also help other users or developers . use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please make sure to make a mistake there if something is at the correction of a defect in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only a blank playlist appears .
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the Start sub@@ window has been converted to the stati@@ stic window . you can find it under Extras Statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the evaluation by the user while points are automatically calculated .
to rate pieces , the evaluation column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the title bar of the playlist and select column . click anywhere in the new application column to specify the evaluation for a piece . you can also use the Short@@ cuts Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard . or right click on your choice and then select Von playlist to remove from the pop @-@ up menu .
drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and let them fall , just as you would do with other files too . that &apos;s how easy it is : - )
in the toolbar of the playlist , next to the Add button , the playlist is located on the playlist . click on it .
probably you lack the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config utility . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . look also for lib@@ tool , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer can be found in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it via the menu bar below Tools E@@ quali@@ zer ....
none . yes , that &apos;s true ! none ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one of the back@@ end independent approach , so the real question must listen to G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support almost any audio format only imagin@@ able . G@@ Stream@@ er can even de@@ code text and PNG !
it can ! perhaps use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which in default no MP3 decoder are provided ( for pat@@ ent@@ - reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , g@@ g : Red@@ hat mp3 k@@ de , input key
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you use the G@@ Stream@@ er driver with the al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a mixer allows several applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. sb@@ live ) or through the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you search for the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stream@@ er you may need to supply another sink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ sink ) .
this does &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media should be deco@@ ded at first . G@@ Stream@@ er is the best choice for most people , if you &apos;re looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stream@@ er reads the file , deco@@ ding it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stream@@ er can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
either use the G@@ Stream@@ er driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable Sound@@ server with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ apper su@@ id is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ X there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ de@@ cs that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA configuration file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either do not use the Arts drivers but instead G@@ Stream@@ er or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE Multimedia completely to get the faster Arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ pi@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc . ) .
probably use the arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been highly optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buff@@ ers in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less beams react to the visu@@ aliz@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stream@@ er is installed , but when I want to switch to the Stream@@ er driver , cr@@ ashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; why ?
after installing G@@ Stream@@ er you have to register all the components . run g@@ st register to register all the G@@ Stream@@ er components .
read the G@@ Stream@@ er FAQ . if this does not help , you can also ask in the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( quit amar@@ ok previously ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run the g@@ st register , once as a system administrator and once as your normal user . then delete the module folder of G@@ Stream@@ er all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with g@@ st @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run g@@ st @-@ register again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
if you have a whole list of suggestions / desires , please send them to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very and find that the name sounds good . furthermore , the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm execute this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you walk to bed , then you will be awak@@ ened by the gentle tones of the music you stopped before bed .
how to get the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current titles when you are on another computer ?
if a functioning SS@@ H environment exists , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you interpre@@ ter and title of the current piece : s@@ sh -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ use@@ Name Amar@@ ok player now@@ Play@@ ing
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this requires your identification in the file ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; windows are separated . in addition , press the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size changeable window .
the combination of C@@ trl + right mouse button presents a piece in the click sequence into the queu@@ e . pressing the Enter key after searching in the playlist , the first search result is played and the search is reset .
OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky functions , but what about the icon in the Control Panel of the Control Panel ?
click the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; click on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browsers should be displayed .
my personal folder $ HOME is on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and there are many error messages appearing on the console . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you have to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ ok &apos;s MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click on the audio CD in the menu . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . for normal reading , go to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic code , take files from folders mp3 or og@@ g instead .

basically , this fits the previous evaluation with a decre@@ asing value based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence has every single evaluation on the overall result .
you can add the review for a piece by clicking with the right mouse button on a column header in the play@@ lists window . then you can change the score as well as all other attributes , namely by clicking the right mouse button on the piece and edit : select app@@ rais@@ al or press F2 . you can also edit the rating in the Metad@@ ata dialog .
the developers do not want to tell you when you want to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed publishing plan that does not match the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new function in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find anno@@ ying . de@@ activate the option icon while playing animated in the general settings .

Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler is a free service to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free username and password . Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; supported .
if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of cr@@ ashes and therefore a lot of bug reports .
pres@@ um@@ ably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore the . / configure routine did not compile these output modules . you need &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules do not appear yet . and now ?
probably you use a distribution that inst@@ alls the development files separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stream@@ er is installed , the necessary Developer files are missing . you must now install the package g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel . the same goes for x@@ ine , you must install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel .
I get the error G@@ Stream@@ er @-@ Cri@@ tical * * : factory for &apos;@@ ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix this ?
your version of G@@ Stream@@ er was compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , this is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stream@@ er . you must compile G@@ Stream@@ er without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with Stream@@ er , the g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module must also be installed next to g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad .
you get the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .

I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use Amar@@ ok the second sound card ?
set up settings Amar@@ ok ... enter the audio output . typically h@@ w : 0 for standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second one .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with a on@@ board AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
pc@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type plug sl@@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } c@@ t@@ l.@@ intel@@ 8x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } pc@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sl@@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; } c@@ t@@ l.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
in the Setup dialog by x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio and output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of the sample rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the tick on the sound@@ card supports m@@ map .
we are sorry , but the audio output with Arts is not supported further . of course you can take this problem yourself into your hand ! if you would like , you can become the new so much needed super@@ visor for arts : )
listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup wiz@@ ard that is displayed at first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to update your collection afterwards , or the wiz@@ ard just don &apos;t like , then this Quick Start Guide should be a help . with its help you &amp; Amar@@ ok will have set up in just a few minutes .
creating a playlist is very simple . drag items from the collection browser to the playlist . if you are happy with the playlist , then the tree view will only store the remaining matching entries . if you are satisfied with the playlist , you can save it with the help of the button Play@@ list . you will find this button on the toolbar of the playlist window .
if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add these play@@ lists to the playlist . if the playlist is in the folders of your collection , and you have the option to import play@@ lists , you &apos;ll find different ways to load the playlist .
to play an audio CD , select Ac@@ tual Audio CD from the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and CD @-@ pieces in WAV format . simply drag the WAV files into the playlist and then press the Convert button .
the audio CD feature uses the protocol Audi@@ oc@@ d : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function is also available in the playlist . just click with the right mouse button on one entry and follow the Burn menu . you have different options for burning a CD .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; pres@@ upp@@ oses the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . plus , some additional packages are listed , making work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more enjoyable .
if you install these packages via a package management system ( such as RPM or apt ) , you also need to install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player also has &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a player window with the most important functions . additionally , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however , a playlist that is superior to all others . the playlist window contains several browsers with which you can capture and browse your entire music collection .
this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok are used , including creating a collection and a playlist .
the Player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window is a run@@ time display showing the current piece or the current running stream . directly below is the area , the game time , bit rate and sampling rate of the current piece .
the player window also includes a selection of audio analy@@ zers , even under the running text display . you can switch through the available Analy@@ zer by clicking the left mouse button on the area .
the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , larger window .
under the running text display are also the buttons PL and E@@ Q . the button PL is activated or dis@@ ables the play@@ lists window while the E@@ Q button is used to set up E@@ Q .
the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the play @-@ position slider . use the sli@@ ders to adjust the play position or volume . with the playback buttons , you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or last item .
the use of the built @-@ in E@@ quali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets from classic to tech@@ no , and you can easily create your own default settings .
to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer use Tools E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click on the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you select the equ@@ ali@@ zer check box , the E@@ quali@@ zer is in operation .
the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia players . it has many features that do not exist in any other player . but don &apos;t let the abundance of functions deter you , they are all easy to use .
the play@@ lists window can be divided into two main areas , on the left hand side is the navigation area . in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context browser . on the right there is the playlist itself . the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users performance strong enough .
the context browser displays different information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be adapted with the help of context browser designs . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpre@@ ter . these three sub@@ windows are later examined in detail .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you might notice that the startup window has fallen away . the information presented there is now divided into other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; additionally , the information can be collected in the statistics window ( Extras Statistics ) .
the sub@@ window music displays information about the just running piece , as well as the interpre@@ ters and the album .
the first section in this sub@@ window shows information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . among them you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to track the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
you can find more information on the current piece under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time and its rating .
to display cover pictures in the context browser , the cover pictures need to be stored in the same folder as the current piece . the images may have any names , but pictures with the word front in the name are preferred . the context browser will also display cover pictures embedded either with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
the next section , suggested pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
among the recommended pieces are the favorite pieces of this interpre@@ ter . this section shows the five highest scores of the current interpre@@ ter .
you can set which information to be displayed in the music sub@@ window . click with the right mouse button somewhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , the interpre@@ ter &apos;s albums , lists all albums of the current interpre@@ ter you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be opened and you will see the content of the album .
you can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately . you can also right click on it and then select one of the options to add the piece or album to the playlist from the pop @-@ up menu .
this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download text for writing scripts . once you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if there is no text script running , you can choose which should be started .
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the changed version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . there is no running text script necessary .
the search button opens a search on goo@@ g@@ le.com after the lyrics for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing interpre@@ ter - only group@@ ed the top level , each piece is shown directly below the interpre@@ ter . albums or gen@@ res are om@@ itted .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - In addition , the pieces are sorted by interpre@@ ter and there will be another distribution according to the respective album . if you want to see compositions or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Various interpre@@ ters .
group@@ ing interpre@@ ter / year - album - S@@ ort by interpre@@ ter and then after the year of the album in desc@@ ending order ( the latest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the standard 0 - album name is related .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically among each other . the interpre@@ ter is ignored .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t - your pieces will be shown first by genre and below by interpre@@ ter .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted according to album below the interpre@@ ter .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize and combine the group@@ ing according to your needs .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically record your collection once you change something to the selected folders . if you own a lot of pieces , this might take a while .
a search filter is located directly under the toolbar . it acts in the list view as well as in the tree view . hints for using this filter can be found in the list of the playlist in this manual .
the search filter is a selection field , with which help you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection . you can also select different time windows from the last 24 hours to a year . you can of course select your entire collection , whereby the filter is practically switched off .
clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser gives you the following options .
load - This emp@@ ties the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order into playback .
attach to playlist - Ad@@ ds the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you will have the same effect .
tune the pieces in queu@@ e - this function adds the selected pieces to the queu@@ e . this will be played next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you &apos;ll be asked for a name under which the list should be saved .
transferred to media player - Ad@@ ds the pieces to the media player to transfer the pieces to the media player . see the section on Media Player Browser for more details .
burn all pieces of this interpre@@ ter / burn to CD - The selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned as a data or as an audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed .
edit metadata ( for pieces ) ... - Op@@ ens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) Move files to the bin ... - Cre@@ ate a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
highlight as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation , which promp@@ ts it to appear among different interpre@@ ters .
undo compilation mark - Chang@@ es a record marked as a compilation album back into a normal album . after that the album will no longer be displayed under Various interpre@@ ts but again among the corresponding interpre@@ ter .
the play@@ lists browser makes handling of many play@@ lists quite simple . among other things , he also contains Intelligent Play@@ lists .
the lower part of the play@@ lists browser contains the smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that has never been played .
even self @-@ created play@@ lists are possible . click Intelligent playlist to open the dialog to create a new Smart playlist . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the Media Player sub@@ window is used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with your portable media player ( such as iPod ) . for example , to be included in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod by interpre@@ ter sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the performer list . if you &apos;re done , click App@@ ly . this will upload the pieces to your iPod . when the transmission is complete , quit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and solve the drive binding for your iPod .
the tool bar is a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden which do not meet your search criteria .
for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .g@@ z enter and press Enter , you can click on music in the file musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .g@@ z . now you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of files can be difficult by simply falling down . in this case the holding holding of the Shift key can be helpful : by doing so , dropped files are automatically inserted at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position .
you can change the order by simply drag@@ ging the entries with the mouse to the desired position . as soon as you enter the letter there is only the pieces that contain the letters . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty again .
if you enter by spaces separate search terms , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries containing all search terms . for example , if you enter one two three , the search will find all entries containing one , two and three .
for example , one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found containing one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) .
if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , then fill the key@@ word with ge@@ ese @-@ feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will be sought after entries which Mike Old@@ field contain , but not by entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a specific search column , you can also search for larger or smaller ones . for example : rating : &gt; 50 . this looks for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , make a minus sign before the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain anything .
you can combine these syntax variants according to your needs . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 comment : bathroom . this is looking for all the pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and not contain the comment bath .
you can set the playback sequence of entries by holding the C@@ trl key , and then clicking with the right mouse button in the desired order on the entries . then the entries will be marked with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the playlist of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left you will find the Add button to add the playlist to the playlist .
next , the buttons will follow feedback and restore . this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the toolbar you find a unique , magni@@ fying analy@@ zer . the refres@@ h rate can be set with a click of right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button on toolbar is menu . it opens the same menu as that which you get in the player window over the right mouse button . through this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
there are many other available buttons for the toolbar , for example playback controls and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and set up Tool@@ bar .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total play time of all pieces . in addition , the status for random mode and retri@@ eval is displayed . the status for random mode and retri@@ eval can be easily changed by clicking the mouse twice in the corresponding display area .
you can also hide the status bar . to do this , disable the Status bar option in the General settings .
the context menu can be accessed by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking the playlist in the playlist . through this menu you can access the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok ;
a click on this entry will open the window visu@@ alization plug @-@ ins . there you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok ;
behind this entry there is a sub@@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the Cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover pictures . you can start it by selecting actions cover administration in the collection browser .
the cover administration contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an interpre@@ ter in your collection by selecting the interpre@@ ter on the left .
with the View menu , you can choose what to display in the cover administration . select :
the queu@@ e administration received your great suit in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature you have even more control over the playlist . after you &apos;ve set a piece into the queu@@ e , the playlist appears next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the plays will play : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on .
to manage the queu@@ e , open over Tools queu@@ e administration . if you want to add a copy of the queu@@ e , select the play in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . then you can change the order of the pieces in the queu@@ e administration .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already given ( the details to set up these follow later ) .
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add other random items while playing .
add pieces based on Last@@ .fm &apos;s recommendations ( formerly : Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler ) . this mode requires that already some pieces in your playlist are located . you do not need a Last@@ .fm profile to do this dynamic playlist .
double click on the playlist you want , drag them to the play@@ lists window or right @-@ click on them and then select Load . this way your current playlist will be replaced by the new one .
the two pre @-@ set modes of Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ lists mix immediately fill your playlist and you can add at least one piece of your collection . the suggested pieces will be added to the next piece of play , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , activate the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic Mode . this will use your existing playlist as starting point . using the same menu entry , dynamic mode can be de@@ activated again .
the New button re@@ plen@@ ishes the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . editing the playlist opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the settings .
with a right @-@ click on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . as a result , the dialog will open to edit the playlist settings .
enter any name for the playlist here . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will grow continuously , the setting for upcoming pieces will be ski@@ pped and they will not hear a piece in this playlist . if the setting is active , the played pieces will be removed with respect to the setting played pieces .
played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist . so you can easily see which pieces have been recently played .
this is the number of pieces to be added to the playlist after each play . if you set more than 1 here , the playlist will grow continuously because only one piece can be played and removed .
the settings on the right are already described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog you can select from existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you cross several play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok will add random items from each of the play@@ lists we have crossed .
some scripts allow your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then click on set @-@ up .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok script scripts by clicking on the script . a selection dialog will open in which a script package can be selected for installation . after you have installed the script , a new entry will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet .
if you don &apos;t want to use a script for longer , you can delete it . to do this , select the script to be deleted and then click Un@@ install .
if you are looking for information on writing your scripts , please refer to the Scrip@@ ts section .
the dialog window visu@@ alisation plug @-@ ins is used to enable the available visu@@ alis@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plug@@ ins . to use a plugin , simply enable the check box next to the name .
this Quick Start Guide should show you how to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to create an audio CD in four steps . to track the steps , you need to have a authentic@@ ated installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog box in which you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other los@@ s@@ less compressed file formats , remember that you will get a bad quality when re@@ encoding MP3 , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD was created by a low @-@ loss format .
in this dialog box you can do nothing . please wait until the machine has finished the burning process .
this Quick Start should show you how to copy &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; copy a data CD in just four steps . to track the steps , you need to have a running installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have and put the source CD into the CD @-@ ROM drive .
to copy a data CD , please choose Extras , Copy CD ... from the menu . you now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning .
after you have done all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , please press the Start button . you now see a dialog that looks like this :
in this dialog box you can track the progress of the copy process . once the read of the original is completed into the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium for which the data should be fired .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burn the image file . you must wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burn the image file . you must wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
the Q@@ T Designer tool U@@ IC can &apos;t find the &amp; k@@ de ; Wid@@ get modules do not find it . to fix this problem , start q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / lib / k@@ de@@ 3 / plug@@ ins to the sear@@ ch@@ path for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS through your base folder by &amp; k@@ de ; ) .
the website of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; can be found at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b@@ .org . there you will receive the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you can also get rid of feedback on community help from the forums and learn more .
if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b , you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program bur@@ ns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ of@@ s ; : burn all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions that also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; offers , and extends these functions even . hence , choose &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , a higher quality with burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , pat@@ ent@@ less and professional technology for audio encoding and for dealing with audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ g@@ g Vor@@ bis de@@ oder@@ - and enco@@ der modules .
mad : this is a high quality MPEG audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
l@@ ame : a widely developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 enco@@ der module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by FLA@@ C decoder module and external audio enco@@ der module so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ w@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : additional libraries for processing different audio formats . for example , it is possible to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burn it to an audio CD .
SO@@ X : a utility that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X Audio Enco@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video editing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ CD@@ Im@@ ager : a full @-@ featured auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assem@@ bling and analy@@ zing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used for adjusting the volume of music files to a standard level . for example , for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections , this can be useful for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections . without norm@@ alize the different record levels of different albums can lead to the un@@ pleas@@ ing effect that the music pieces are played differently lou@@ dly .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to boot from CD and automatically playback all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient method to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the corresponding sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry will open the project .
saves the current project . if the project has already been stored , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it is asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame .
save the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As is displayed with which you can choose folders and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call file Save for every single project file .
includes the current project . if a project has been modified and has not yet been stored , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you can then choose between saving and changes . you can also inter@@ rupt the closing and keep the project so open .
includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for each un@@ saved project what should happen , just as if you have called for each project file closing .
includes all opened projects and ends &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project it is asked what should be done with it as if you had called file closing .
when you access this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you are entering the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD .
open the dialogue &quot; Burn &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button Burn , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for burning the medium , the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described by the What is the ? help described ( re@@ achable via the right mouse button ) .
this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful when you get files for multiple session CD . the data of the previous session will always be included , even if this function is not used . it is intended for you rather than help to allow you to see the files and folders already existing on the media .
this feature causes only an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this feature causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this feature does not remove files from the medium , it only displays the previously imported files .
opens the CD copy dialog . this allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a CD which you can then burn later . you should also prefer cl@@ oning instead of normal copy . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with broken sectors or video CDs .
this enables the copying of a DVD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can also only create a copy of a DVD which you can then burn later . furthermore , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of a normal copy . the converting / reduction of a DVD with the help of the copy dialogue is not yet supported , so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
open the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , allowing the content to be completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing modes Tran@@ scription and incre@@ mental .
burning a previously created CD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source that can then be fired immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as Nr@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can then be fired immediately by pressing the burning button .
a previously selected DVD video can be converted . this dialog appears usually after reading a DVD in the table , but can also be used anywhere . it contains information about the read video , encoding settings , and even ways to change the size and cut black edges .
displays information about the pic@@ kl@@ ed medium . this information is displayed in the table of contents and includes properties of the medium such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
displays a list of the toolbar of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is checked , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view switches on or off . the folder view contains an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the contents view is enabled , their contents will be displayed in the table . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and un@@ locking of the disk or ej@@ ecting the medium .
the content view enables selecting and drag@@ ging files into the project view . the contents view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , provided a drive has been selected with an appropriate CD / DVD in the folder view .
the header is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header bar has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view from the remaining views .
this opens a dialog window to change the button assign@@ ments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . after selecting one of the available commands in the top part , you can adjust the mapping settings below .
this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wiz@@ ard . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator rights are required , so you have to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when starting the wiz@@ ard .
open the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here , general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work on startup . this dialog is meant for person@@ alization and fine tuning of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface parts of the functionality can , for example , be controlled via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line , or the somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in functionality , so rather your taste and type of task is crucial to which of the included programs you give preference .
in this chapter , we assume that you use the d@@ co@@ p command line program . in order to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then enter something like the following on the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; features that have all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions like copy@@ CD , format@@ and other features to create new projects .
void BI@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void bo@@ copy@@ C@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project using the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project Th@@ rough using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface , which can only be used on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String CARD ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( c@@ String : : list ur@@ ls , Q@@ String ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ Item ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String new@@ name ) void set@@ Size ( Q@@ String id )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then inserts files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; a reader for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it can easily be read audio CD ; s can be read and stored into mp3 or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible , depending on the enco@@ der that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; compression data in WAV files on hard disk ) and by many enco@@ ders that code these WAV files ( compressed ) . currently , l@@ ame for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) are supported by default ( These enco@@ der packages still need to be added from the Linux distribution ) . more enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if installed ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and saved into WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these WAV files ( usually one per cap@@ tion ) comp@@ ress into the mp3 or O@@ GG format or other formats like the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . however , all of these programs are usually not necessary to compile anything yourself . however , only the enco@@ der packages are installed which are needed . if , for example , fl@@ ac is not used , the installation is not required .
which encoding / file format should be used ? the chapter Which co@@ di@@ ers gives a small introduction about enco@@ der , audio quality and compression factors .
a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to b@@ ypass any cop@@ ier protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device manages the protection , it is not possible to b@@ ypass the mechanisms of cop@@ ier protection . avoid the purchase of cop@@ ier protected audio CD ; s !
while set @-@ up only needs to be done ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , the daily handling for reading a &amp; CD is explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , which you frequently stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; retrieve information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without a network , with everything manually recorded .
this is just a brief list of the commands of the main window . on the page step by step example you will find more information about how this program is used as well as screen shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for configur@@ ing the program .
starts the CD@@ DB query on CD data according to the installation of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . )
starts reading and - if an enco@@ der is configured in the encoding settings tab , the encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of enco@@ ders available so that the selection can be read with a different enco@@ der than the default . it must be noted that the enco@@ der has previously been configured in the Settings dialog tab in the Setup dialog .
opens the file manager so that an already read file is selected to code instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and code .
opens the Setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pi@@ p@@ ses ) for program events ( such as reading &amp; CD ; termin@@ ated ) .
opens the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different card cards ( such as enco@@ der , to set the enco@@ der ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ders and compression rates and helps you choose the right encoding .
if no audio information is to be lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C there are also others like &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; mon@@ key &apos; that may be available for this distribution .
among the audio formats that lose information by compression according to their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may have an easy advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate differences are less important as both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is nevertheless provided free with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license issues
+ High to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly lower quality at lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music should be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play@@ devices is present .
MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has already quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . always requires 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all songs of a title . good enough for the music of yo@@ ung@@ sters , portable devices and car levels . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered or fet@@ ched through the program from the fre@@ ed@@ b over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can hand / use with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the encoding program to generate the folder and file name as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD ; titles to the keywords ( English : tag ) when MP@@ 3s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ tt of l@@ ame and the title parameters must be added by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wiz@@ ard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs that you can download / type the information instead of typ@@ ing yourself into the computer . it is important to note that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Title , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note from the U@@ eb@@ ers@@ etz@@ ers : there@@ with the author is meant ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be hurt .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; actively select a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b it can be used with another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address than the one in the system . in this type of configuration , it seems , the e @-@ mail address is not used when calling the data from the server ( This can only know the program@@ mer who checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and compar@@ es the load between the hosts .
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save into WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know it more accurately , search in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this has not yet been done .
to save the read WAV files , the enco@@ der and thus the desired file format can be selected . the first opening contains pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab to set up the enco@@ der . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab itself .
the enco@@ der package must be installed from the Linux distribution in question before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined enco@@ der . more information about enco@@ ders can be found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a enco@@ der , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) .
this can have many causes . check the device description of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , write and read reviews on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio co@@ di@@ ers of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fl@@ ac &amp; etc ; ) . try to invoke both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could give a hint on what is wrong .
check if you do not want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check the envel@@ ope of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , all understood , but are still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and use our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 keywords ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . for example , a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found with a search engine as it is considered as non @-@ free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can do of course .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is and that you own write permission to copy it ( eg by trying to copy something inside the con@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section deals with the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; something that is probably done only once and
the second section describes the procedure to read a &amp; CD ; what must be repeated for each recording &amp; CD .
here we determine the enco@@ der to be used to compression the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not be able to change it every time you read a &amp; CD ; change once the matching settings are found .
the device name is handed over to the reading program so it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces can be read .
frequently / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your disk . if this does not work or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive exists , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of the device descriptions for CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the Map tab General Settings . here &apos;s not much to do . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything will be left / entered as shown in the scre@@ enshot .
only for incomplete information can be selected , so that you will be informed if information about the creation of keywords ( tags ) are missing .
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are convenient and release the &amp; CD ; data automatically via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet while reading the &amp; CD , so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second drop down box is simpler , a &amp; CD ; entry found , starts immediately the reading of the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk when you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can easily be changed . the directory or fil@@ en@@ ame is changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to manually enter everything manually , disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used if you download the database first . however , this is over 620 MB large , consider this twice whether this is worthwhile . to fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card card .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for quer@@ ying the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how do the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section on fre@@ ed@@ b . set everything as shown in the scre@@ enshot .
mode : we haven &apos;t downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server near you . on this way the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work equivalent to the server , as many fire@@ walls will boot the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , perhaps there is more luck with the 80 protocol , since the protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example we don &apos;t want to add &amp; CD ; data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server must be sent . the first check box should de@@ activate .
just take the settings from the scre@@ enshot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of pieces simultaneously : exc@@ use , is there a reason why more than one at the same time with only an existing drive ? parall@@ el@@ it reading and encoding ? the author does not know , so simply try yourself .
CD ; ej@@ ection after reading the last piece : tick this to the &amp; CD ; disc@@ ard at the end of the process .
user @-@ defined folders for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must be specified the path / folder where the WAV files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget to use this folder if you want to make something with the WAV files .
just type as it is on the screen shot . the command is a little long , under circumstances something needs to be left to the right to see everything .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is average about 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage .
note the &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; entry for restric@@ ting the generation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags may also be deleted if required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as shown in the scre@@ enshot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of WAV files to be enco@@ ded simultaneously : with a dual core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine , you can try to code more than one WAV file at the same time .
this is it , we just have the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; termin@@ ated . this configuration is used as standard for any reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music smart , you never need to change them again .
this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , has been described and set up in the previous section . first , a connection to the Internet is set up , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b needs to be picked up .
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the scre@@ enshots look a bit different from the data for a &amp; CD ; therefore you will learn the &amp; CD ; manually enter data instead of retri@@ eving it from the internet . comments will point to the differences .
do not try the &amp; CD ; to find this example . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this has not happened yet , then the &amp; CD must now be inserted into the drive defined in the main window .
after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the scre@@ enshot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen then search in the Frequ@@ ently Ask@@ ed Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers according to the Help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already filled and the name of the artist and the album are displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; a window will pop up , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for Settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button on the toolbar . if you do not have a local database , but retrieve the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - Input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist must no longer be entered in the input field &apos; Current title &apos; unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece .
the bottom comment field can be used for the individual comments of ini@@ di@@ vidu@@ al per piece , the commentary field of the album is used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the next screen shot . however , it is always a good idea to verify the content of the CD editor , so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name , but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks .
note : in this example we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on just 28 characters for the comment area . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least for what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum allowed . this option is set up on the encoding settings tab ; take a look at the &apos; Def@@ ault Settings &apos; section .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later at any time using the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by all coding or file formats . see the help of the enco@@ der to get more information .
for more information go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or rap , for example , are to be found under Rock .
after selecting &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editor will appear again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data that we have collected for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the list .
note that it has a check mark before each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . simply click on the line switches the selection of the piece , or press the All pieces selected at the bottom of the screen to choose all the pieces at once .
if by clicking on the button selection read out the reading process , this window will appear for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what runs out .
click on the tab jobs to switch on the order window . it is located in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the toolbar .
this is the window for controlling the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message can be seen if you are trying to work with a enco@@ der that you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully co@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the job list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have typ@@ ed here in the example . have you checked if you have write access to the folders for the temporary files and the destination folders ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece .
the job 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . this allows reading and encoding in parallel . note the status message in the bottom part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program does not have a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and encoding . in case of weak machines , the result is un@@ clear . the used machine with a AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to have problem with simultaneous reading and encoding ( of however two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is in the queu@@ e of the encoding . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is maintained today within the &amp; k@@ de ; C@@ VS is a part of the k@@ de@@ multimedia package . however , if you are familiar with C@@ VS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . most distri@@ butions contain already a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is included . if you read this , you probably already have done it ...
this section is aimed at people who compile from source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help , as the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls for many different programs has many variants of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays scre@@ enshots of the different card @-@ cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
Hi , still reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked on after the first @-@ time start of the program , without any indication of how to go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; thought . whoever wants to add or change something useful , may it do . and if you read this , he has left this section and is therefore agre@@ eing with this proposal .
strange when you managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; get SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these Inform@@ ations , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; ist der MI@@ DI@@ - und Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er von &amp; k@@ de ; . besides others , he has a real @-@ time graphic and Kar@@ aoke @-@ real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts also some features that others &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of any MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song events or text properties ) . k@@ mid will automatically detect the process used .
seat support . if you stop &amp; k@@ de ; finish playing a song , k@@ mid starts with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesi@@ zers , A@@ WE , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog , which allows you to select the song you want .
you can also allow a file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window will drop . this also works with multiple songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the kno@@ b playing in the toolbar , select the listing from the menu item or press the space key .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece starts automatically once you pull it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( in several pieces you will be added to a collection and then played one after one . )
once and k@@ mid , play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and navig@@ ating with the kno@@ b .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right of the tempo display and so change the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the button bar acts like a pressure on the button Pause or selecting the menu item Pause in the menu item , so breaks the playback . press the space key while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use text properties , others use lyrics and others use both . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set which events to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically retri@@ eved that a song is used , so you will automatically adjust the kar@@ aoke text . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set an event type , select the menu items or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also includes the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summar@@ ize . these are played by the series . in this section you will see how you can use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find this in the menu collection under the point organizing .... Click here to New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the winn@@ ings in the collection manager .
the temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection will not be stored . remember that if you add lots of pieces .
to add songs to a collection , you must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the Add button . it will again appear the file dialog , which allows you to select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on the Automati@@ cally add to the collection .
when Automati@@ cally add to the collection , a piece will be added automatically to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) .
if Automati@@ cally add to the collection is not activated , when opening a piece , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will then be added to the remaining items .
to delete a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series after the sub@@ menu sequence order from the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection .
when you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop down list above kar@@ aoke text .
to jump a song further , select the Next song button , the next song from the menu item or press the button arrow on the right .
to jump back a song , select the Previous piece , the item Previous piece from the menu item or press the button arrow on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter , since it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesi@@ zers , which are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map combines general MIDI events in events that the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI @-@ map that conver@@ ts all events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano events in the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et type , making it possible to sound a trumpet when originally playing a piano .
if you only have one sound card , you do not need MIDI @-@ Map because all sound cards GM @-@ compatible ( incl . A@@ we and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps , so you have to edit the appropriate file manually ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all the required re@@ aliz@@ ations for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except for the key@@ map section that may appear as often as desired . however , the requirement for this is that each occurrence has a different tex@@ ti@@ d ( see below ) .
Def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... END Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of key@@ map &quot; ... END Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; A further key@@ map ... &quot; END Def@@ ine CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... END OP@@ TION@@ S ... END
you see Def@@ ine is used to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and END that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an email so that I in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide support for devices that are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible .
this section describes how the patches of General MIDI are displayed to your specific keyboard . general usage is as follows :
please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you can &apos;t change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to set all the sounds that this instrument need to set to tone with number M . if your keyboard is not supported for example ( GM Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to a gun shot .
so if a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 ( Win shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term Tro@@ mmel Patch the patch is meant to represent another perc@@ ussi@@ onist instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ acas &amp; etc . ) and not the one with which the sound means the pitch of the always same drum ( like some key@@ boards ) .
the key@@ map section is needed to indicate how tones are displayed on a certain channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the order of rows is very important , as well as their presence . so you need to create 128 entries .
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and every instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are used mainly to map sounds on the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel . take a look at the key@@ maps provided .
this section can be used to map some channels to another . for example , if you want to sw@@ ap the first and second channel , just make it in the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are useful for Key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI to Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
Midi devices need 16 channels , the CHAN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern :
n is the channel , which is shown on the channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map will be used with the name name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which will try to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x will always be used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful , for example , to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel .
the pitch value for pitch ratio indicates in which ratio pitch @-@ B@@ ender events are multiplied . so if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ B@@ ender event with the value n , it is converted to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used to avoid dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM shows that a keyboard , which is supposed to play a pitch @-@ b@@ ender event with the value 40@@ 96 , should play a tone higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards try to play two tones up to one oc@@ t@@ ave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI @-@ Map , simply open the dialog MIDI Settings . you can find this in the Settings menu , point MIDI settings
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see which sounds are played straight .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel . for each channel there is a drop down list where you can choose an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button doesn &apos;t illumin@@ ate green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( up to now ) two different views to display the played sounds . view the View menu under the View menu view : settings
the tempo LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the bigger the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find , for example , a song is too fast to follow the lyrics , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . thus , the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
well , I cannot force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because it was compiled without A@@ WE support . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually .
agree , therefore support &amp; k@@ mid ; Dra@@ g &amp; Drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , choose all the files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ windows .
before , select Automati@@ cally add the Automati@@ cally add to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to recover the default tempo you can double click on the LCD .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ desktop a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; windows with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or I want to play a file , just switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; draw .
if you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection , turn off the Automati@@ cally add to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . open files
let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you just want to play the first file . so set the Automati@@ cally add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then you decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do it ?
these people sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , it anim@@ ates me to program on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Malaga ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; E@@ d. at the moment I am in the third year , so I do not have much free time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit of time .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; have , or even if you want to make me happy , write me an email : Lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really make me a great pleasure if you send me a postcard from your home or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all those who send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will record with friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; but before you send a MIDI file , you should contact me as I might already have the file .

and of course my thanks also apply to all these excellent musicians in the network , who give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on his homepage , which is located under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .html . on the homepage you can follow the development , look for information and look at pictures . you will also find links to sites with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it &apos;s not the same whether you use a FM radio device or an A@@ WE card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ V@@ IS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can &apos;t hear music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; KM@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ ono and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as to play DVD s , VCD s or TV and camera .

the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ ock@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is a window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is shown in it .
it is possible to save the preferred links under the menu book@@ marks , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Continu@@ ous Play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy . if you anc@@ ake an entry , his group and all its sub @-@ groups are copied to the current category and playback starts with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and permanent playlist can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course you can only do this if &amp; KM@@ Player ; not running . the various files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / , can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself .
after changing XML files , you need to select the playlist from the menu item and select either the editing mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without equal to the playlist .
due to the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player , some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation of starting and loading can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and change &#91; General Options &#93; No in@@ tro = 0 default option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; KM@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during boot doesn &apos;t need to be short , it will automatically termin@@ ate by opening another source . this would be dis@@ rup@@ tive in the end @-@ animation , so the user can end the application a second time .
a simple example of an animation can be the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; Save &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / gt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; In the source package of &amp; KM@@ Player ; are supported in the directory / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L supported by &amp; KM@@ Player ;
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog by &amp; KM@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; button in the toolbar of KM@@ Player . here is the output of m@@ player obvious .
there is no rider for this playback device in the configuration dialog by &amp; KM@@ Player ; all must be configured by manual editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c , just like setting the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; is played with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; KM@@ Player ; it can even be added to the specific field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
for the &amp; KM@@ Player to play &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player ; module as a service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the Setup dialog file assign@@ ments of K@@ DE will be specified .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages concerning loading the browser module library . the stolen process is called kn@@ p@@ player . if there are no errors , the back@@ end output is within &amp; KM@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu to check ) .
thus always a given back@@ end for a particular M@@ ime type is taken ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by manual change of file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , Ph@@ on@@ on should play all og@@ g files :
&amp; KM@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be looked , the device will need to be used and the TV channels need to be used . for this , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configure V@@ DR ( video data recor@@ ders ) settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialog is included in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there , ports should be detected from which one is selected . the encoding to be used must be figured out ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b included in it .
since the V@@ DR support of KM@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this way of playing video equipment among Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux expansion must be functional for the X server . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 Server it must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig )
internally by KM@@ Player for the sources use different names . at the time of the emergence of this documentation , this is dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ fat@@ y , pi@@ p@@ es@@ our@@ ce , t@@ v@@ Scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ cd source .
is there evidence that I can make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the VCD : / / ) ?
yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom can be used as root after connecting the device . it is absolutely certain that / dev / c@@ drom can be found on the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine starts only slowly , why does my CPU have to be checked for its performance every time ?
note : the answer is over@@ ed@@ . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically takes the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed to compile &amp; build .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to use the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution . for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; C@@ ile ; -@@ Project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages of &amp; K@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further compile and are on the tile ; -@@ website included .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; K@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all the suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or documentation is desired , contact via the tile ; website should be made .
if you have any questions or if you would like to compile &amp; K@@ ile ; on or if extensions are desired , this should be addressed to the mailing list K@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; K@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; work area . &amp; K@@ ile ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this one simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . furthermore offers &amp; C@@ ile ; the ability to complete , comp@@ iling , re@@ processing and error searches within the source code as well as conversion and viewing tools for these . finally , the easy to use wiz@@ ard , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; works ; and to experience his possibilities , the manual should be drawn to Kate . users of &amp; K@@ ile ; can start working directly with the reading of the chapter works with the editor of &amp; works ; start .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right output : lay @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex is easy to use , a la@@ ie ( eng@@ l. lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros can also be used . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it comes from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort .
if there is only a good night view to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book about it . around &amp; lat@@ ex ; to be able to master correctly , good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r .
just as other mark@@ ers include &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction to which the general characteristics such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text size are specified as well as a body with the text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ end { document } .
the Quick@@ step wiz@@ ard by &amp; K@@ ile ; is a useful function for fast creation of a document in &amp; tile ; the selection of the wiz@@ ard ( menu ) provides some possibilities for the creation of the document .
document Cl@@ asses : this includes the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ book &#93; , proj@@ ector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , foil &#91; prosp@@ er &#93; or user defined .
encoding : this is set to set the encoding . modern systems increasingly use UT@@ F @-@ 8 encoding as standard . UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used add @-@ on packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for em@@ bedding it only needs to be balanced in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , Cover ( DIN ) : the documentation classes of KO@@ MA @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN provisions ) .
new users don &apos;t need to worry about this . it &apos;s just a brief description of the functions and further information about this will be given in the section .
&amp; K@@ ile ; provides - just like other source editors - high@@ lighting the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; C@@ ile , it is very likely that any mathematical environment is not closed . however , you may have noticed it through the modest appearance of output file . however , it will save you by high@@ lighting your time and time .
with the automatic completion of the environment , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) of &amp; K@@ ile ; automatically generates a blank line ( for input of the text ) and the corresponding line to the lie@@ uten@@ ant of the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set in the menu settings tile ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document to the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ paragraph the lowest element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex . as soon as a DVI @-@ file has been created , j@@ umps and tile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer to the corresponding line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is besides PDF the usual output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools for viewing , conversion and printing of DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and devices .
when using reverse search , the elements of the DVI ; file are linked with the editor and as soon as on an element in the DVI ; file cli@@ cked , the exact opposite is displayed . as soon as on a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code was cli@@ cked , the corresponding location is displayed in the DVI ; viewer .
master document : this function is used in working with multiple files . with a master document , working with other .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be configured for project settings .
quick @-@ build : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there are no errors in the source code ) .
file Monitoring : in this mode , the DVI ; file is carried out on transi@@ tional dat@@ ashe@@ ets and there is no call to &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after quick installation .
when viewing the editing tool bar , the three large selection fields should be highlighted . the selection fields were developed for fast introduction of common elements into the document . the first selection field is for fast structure of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; lat@@ ex commands for sub@@ division are :
the selection panel Fur@@ ther is for the introduction of items such as keywords , joint notes or references . the available possibilities are :
name : with this command a name for a section , an image or other element is created .
cover : used for reference to a specified term ( selection Ã ¼ ber a selection field possible ) .
when using quote , a selection list is displayed with literature entries . for &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex , this only works if the file belongs to a project . for editing &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are necessary editors . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can be written in &amp; K@@ ile ; by hand .
the last drop @-@ down box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ø e is used for setting the fonts . it can be set the font sizes for the main text , the joints notes , etc . the following font sizes are available :
when calling &amp; K@@ ile , there are two selection options : 1 . the wiz@@ ard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and st@@ ating the settings . 2 . the document can be written from scratch .
the brackets after the command \ \ Docum@@ entation contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; speci@@ fies the font size . if the font size is not set at the beginning , this can also be done in the text .
once the source code above has been entered , the source code needs to be compiled . the simpl@@ est way to do this is the use of the Men@@ Ã ¼ s Bauen or Kn@@ op@@ fs Schnell@@ bau .
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; C@@ ile ; ensures storage automatically .
if the comp@@ iling of the document is missing , it should be searched for error in the log file . when using quick @-@ build , &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be taken into account .
an environment ( environment environment ) is a text which is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font size of 12 is created and only a few sach@@ ets shall have a different font size . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ loose and \ \ end { environment } is then possible to em@@ bed the nam@@ ing of the font nucle@@ i within the surroundings .
the changes are only included within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no limit ( number ) for the changes in an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the legi@@ bility and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fonts , gre@@ ase pressure , cur@@ sive printing , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands either end with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the itali@@ c printing and is available until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in one set can be displayed using \ \ emp@@ h { word } itali@@ c .
\ \ quot@@ a : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { quot@@ a } and ends with \ \ end { quot@@ a } .
once the background was presented to write the source text with the &amp; lat@@ ex , then a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; cas@@ ile is followed .
once a bit of text was entered in the wiz@@ ard , a few adjustments should be carried out for the better read@@ ability of the document . for this , a quote , a few places in the gre@@ ase and cur@@ sive pressure and a poem for the application should come to see the differences of these commands .
once the document is viewed , the editor @-@ view or C@@ trl E can be returned to the editor ( for internal viewer ) . with an external viewer , the windows must be closed .
once the DVI file is created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun .
DVI ; is a device independent file format . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output like printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can then be printed using file printing ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the toolbar allows converting the DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI output is created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code , the conversion can begin using the buttons in the toolbar .
the pre@@ diction search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; K@@ ile ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex files . to do so , just set up Modern in Settings tile ... Tools will be selected .
to execute the search search , the mouse poin@@ ter has to be positioned on a line of the source text and cli@@ cked on pre@@ diction search . the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer is then done .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document of &amp; K@@ ile ; open and spr@@ inkl@@ ed to the appropriate line . to do this &amp; K@@ ile ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; set as a text editor ( configure the ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
if using fast @-@ mounting the &amp; DVI ; viewer does not open , an error can occur . if an error occurs , it will be summar@@ ized in the log file or in the message window .
the log file per@@ si@@ sts the source code in source code . in the editor , the pop @-@ up La@@ Te@@ X errors and lay@@ outs can be used between the errors . the log file always speci@@ fies the line in which the error appears . to view the faul@@ ty line , it must be cli@@ cked on the error in the logging and &amp; K@@ ile ; j@@ umps to the er@@ ron@@ eous line .
as soon as the respective button is cli@@ cked on the toolbar , a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document . the pres@@ et options are :
when selecting blank document , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or the wiz@@ ard can be used for fast creation of a new document . for more information , see the section .
FAQ users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must be opened or a new file will be created .
when creating a new document from a template using the File New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in settings tile ... Settings can be set in general .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SSO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is sub@@ stituted by entering document class . typically , it will be used as follows : \ \ Docum@@ entation &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SSO@@ P@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { article } .
the simpl@@ est way to create a template is to use the wiz@@ ard and the associated instructions in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps have been completed :
when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected rather than the default .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files will be created . if a simple way to create a template , you should search for one on the Internet and follow the steps described below .
&amp; K@@ ile ; used &amp; works ; as an internal editor . &amp; works ; is a text editor for programm@@ ers with the possibility of reading and origin@@ ating from many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many adjustments for &amp; works ; can be made directly from &amp; K@@ ile .
to find out more about &amp; works ; and to experience his possibilities , the manual should be drawn to Kate . users of &amp; K@@ ile can work there directly with the reading of the chapter works with the editor of &amp; works ; start .
&amp; K@@ ile ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be accessed via the Men@@ Ã ¼ id La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex , as well as their syntax .
double @-@ click with pressed C@@ trl key to choose the &amp; tex ; this means that by clicking on \ \ by \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p only \ \ par is selected .
when drag@@ ging the text with left mouse button , the selected text will be copied automatically to the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; C@@ ile ; has the possibility to browse different kinds of source code and empha@@ size them . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex commands differ from the normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ulas are highlighted by another color .
many wiz@@ ards can add additional sprin@@ ting marks . this is a custom form of book@@ marks inside the text . the Men@@ Ã ¼ Con@@ trÃ ¤ ge Edit Spr@@ ung@@ brands or the corresponding key functions allow the jump to the next or last jump mark .
editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; tile ; although &amp; works ; already outstanding features , have been added in &amp; C@@ ile ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text added ; special commands for their selection . under editing , the following commands for selecting text are included :
choose a complete paragraph ( group of lines that contain a blank line on both sides ) . this extended meaning does not include a text with common lines ( as in other text editors ) . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code .
select the word under the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , since this command also includes lat@@ ex ; commands with a return line ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) in the end .
to delete a part of the document , it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; K@@ ile ; provides the key element C@@ trl ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; K@@ ile ; provides with own commands for a faster possibility . under Edit Rem@@ ove the following commands to delete the text include :
remo@@ ves a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; K@@ ile ; is contained in the description to edit selected paragraph .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , Offers &amp; C@@ ile ; for further commands under Edit Environment for a possible simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to display the environment .
this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command for lie@@ uten@@ tion of the environment .
if the cursor is located in front of or inside the \ \ begin { area } command , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering a lot of ne@@ sted ambient commands , the overview can quickly be lost . this command complet@@ es the recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment structure is not destroyed .
&amp; K@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ groups specified by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that match those from Edi@@ ting environment .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the cur@@ ving clip .
this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the shar@@ pen@@ ed cl@@ asp .
if the cursor is located in front of or behind the cur@@ ving clip of a &amp; tex ; group # , it will jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering a large number of cl@@ utter@@ ed group par@@ enth@@ eses quickly , the over@@ look can be lost . this command complet@@ es the last opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be destroyed .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple quotes are used as gÃ ¤ n@@ se@@ per@@ schen . for the purpose @-@ making implementation is used in &amp; K@@ ile ; the sign is used for two simple quotes . also for the end of the introduction the sign is used .
this automatic set @-@ up of double quotes may set up in settings tile ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
it can also be used lÃ ¤ n@@ der@@ specific settings ( such as german or french ) and thus German or French quotation marks . there are also many other languages available .
when pressing Shift ; input key for &amp; K@@ ill ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is located within a lists environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , not only a line break but at the same time the \ \ item .
within a table environment , add &amp; K@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an associated line break .
even better - &amp; K@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; or custom environments . these can be added under Settings tile ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X added .
some users want to arrange the columns in tables @-@ environments and thereby assign all the E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) each other . when pressing Shift ; Alt ; amp ; search &amp; K@@ ile ; according to the next tab in the indicated row . although this tab@@ ulator is not the associated entry , add &amp; k@@ ile ; add some interval for the columns position of the current tab .
although &amp; works ; already providing a good source code completion , it was added to &amp; K@@ ile ; in order to add special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) . three of them work according to need and the other two are for automatic completion . all these modes can set up for different working modes with settings tile ... fully set .
when starting a new environment using the \ \ begin { Environment } command &amp; tile ; automatically add the \ \ end { area } command after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input will be removed and it is possible to gre@@ et the complete list . on the other hand , the list can also shrink from entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively you can be removed from &amp; K@@ ile ; alternatively , jump brands can be found , so that an easy jump to these positions can be possible by editing Spr@@ ung@@ Trade@@ marks and the desired parameters can be entered .

&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are delivered with many documents . included are a documentation for the contained packages and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
this is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is a complete manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is therefore ideal for searching for a certain format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; cas@@ ile ; divided into three major book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , the finding of the right document is not always easy . as possible help &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k that contains a database with all the available documents and here@@ for a graphical surface .

the plug @-@ ins that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; la@@ det , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even possibly little to do . this makes the plugin system very powerful . you can immediately benefit from the additional functionality and do not need to wait until someone uses the f@@ ake in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the plug@@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements .
to install a plugin or a part , we start editing the Edit menu . this opens the following dialog :
this dialog enables you to manage all plug@@ ins and add new plug@@ ins . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug@@ ins without a location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to searching the plug @-@ in .
often work on a project several people in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and is used for unique identification .
one member may have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub@@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this is done by looking out the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( her identity ) appears bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and setting of your own identity are important in terms of messages and notes . see for more information on comments .
in addition to an overview of your team , there is another advantage by cap@@ turing the members of the team : it can be an event for information to the team leaders when something is happening . see in for more information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be to record the opening and closing of the project so that later it can be seen how much someone worked on it or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that plays a file into C@@ VS once it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the Event Configuration of Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an e @-@ mail is sent to the addres@@ see selected in the recipient list . the addres@@ see can be a team or sub@@ project leader .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
to insert notes is simple . either the note entry is selected from the editor context menu , or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word can be entered in a comment area followed by ann@@ ot@@ ation text .
notes can be sent to an identi@@ fiable member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , with the nick@@ name of the set nick@@ name of the team member , plays a role in the project from the following possibilities : team leader Sub@@ project leader After the range and sub@@ project leaders , the corresponding range or sub @-@ project names should be given as in the following examples below .
nick@@ names and roles names are independent of upper or lower case , but spaces around the par@@ enth@@ eses and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages , which is DT@@ D @-@ agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up using the Qu@@ anta settings ... This dialog extends across some pages that are dealt with one another .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags including car completion , can be changed . the entries are :
large / lo@@ wer@@ case of tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal size / lo@@ wer@@ case means the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / lo@@ wer@@ case of attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal size / lo@@ wer@@ case means the attributes are inserted as described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags automatically include : if attached , for tags , for which the closing tag is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted .
do not include optional tags automatically : as above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags .
start and finish day automatically update : if turned on , the appropriate closing tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic setting of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the corresponding encoding during typ@@ ing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for the detection of different types of files . the default templates can be restored using the default button .
standard string encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise than with file opening opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . but this setting here will be extended by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . but this setting here will be extended by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; creates a regular backup copy , so that during a power failure or crash the next start of the program can restore the document from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in one &apos;s own view ( or documentation in a tab ) , which makes it possible to preview the documentation , preview and source code at the same time .
set the window settings to the default when the next start is useful when the UI by modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depends on views each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning messages section will serve to control the display of war@@ nings by hook from no more questions .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source text view in shared mode . see the different modes see .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the illustration of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be set in detail .
in the mouse @-@ click on the Struc@@ tural tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the structure tree settings the visibility of knot@@ s in the tree can be set automatically when editing and how deeply when changing the structure tree is to be opened . empty knot@@ s are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those with which no element was found in the current document .
the area for setting off short@@ cuts ( a kind of template ) that can be un@@ folded when editing to larger text . abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means , there can be a valid group for PHP , in which the if@@ cl@@ ause abbrevi@@ ation means something else than in a group valid for Javascript .
here , the plug@@ ins can be managed . plug@@ ins are part @-@ applications of third party , which can be re@@ used by any input capable application , most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not located at a standard location like $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / lib .
input : this information is passed to the plugin when starting , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; download component in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simp@@ ly @-@ Read @-@ mode &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plugin is denied the load . read only Read @-@ K@@ parts normally ref@@ uses loading if this option is not selected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
check the plugin : if this is enabled , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the information entered is correct . select to save the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , de@@ bug@@ ging has been completely re@@ developed . support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger has been set , as well as support for the D@@ BG de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin concept has been implemented that allows various implement@@ ations via plug@@ ins .
currently only one plugin is available , support for use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; insert .
using the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with selecting a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the Options button next to the de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ Plugin selection field , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; interface :
a view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed . normally appears in the left D@@ ock .
a view where all stops , with line numbers and conditions are listed . normally appears in the lower D@@ ock .
a view that displays the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . normally appears in the lower D@@ ock .
depending on the supported features of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
this action will make the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger if required , or it tells the plugin to listen to de@@ bug demands . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened , which uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that in the normal case you don &apos;t have to pay attention to it .
the counter@@ part to Deb@@ ug@@ ging session Start the session . closes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the listening to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to launch a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document .
initi@@ ates the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and to send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it happens before a request is started , the script starts with the request .
initi@@ ates de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution continues . if it happens before a request is made , the execution starts once a request is made .
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script without entering the functions or include clu@@ des .
the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script , whereby if possible in functions and clu@@ des errors will be corrected .
in@@ stru@@ cts the de@@ bu@@ gger to ski@@ p the statement and go to the next as if there were not the current one .
opens a dialog in which a variable or an expression can be entered that should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable is set .

&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and / CSS ; s &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , the tag folders and the toolbar . tag folders are handy , symbolic keys of picture kno@@ bs ( above the Edi@@ tier window ) that insert text and instructions faster into a document than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details of conversion .
this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also toolbar . short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the tag shows . the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool slides allow a fast inser@@ tion of tags into a document without danger of a writer .
tag folders are nothing but folder . they contain only the descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders carry the name of the descrip@@ tive language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information when working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing else than only element type .
the type of tag is a script function . when used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text into the dialog . this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is an element type element .
describes an attribute of a tags . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it speci@@ fies the name and type of the attribute . additionally , there are other tags that describe how this attribute should be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element .
provides the source texts used for filling in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to reach source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag which group@@ ed the elements of a list . it can only occur for an attribute description . it is a only element type element .
speci@@ fies the position of the attribute text of a tags within a dialog . this tag can only occur for each attribute in a dialog only once ( e.g. for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this element is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined . this element is a only element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a day . this element is a only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files need to begin with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ti@@ dy and closed properly .
spaces influence nothing , but pay attention &amp; lt ; sign . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause any leg departure , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is in the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to start window and select Tag@@ X@@ M@@ L. . another dialog will appear whose simple instructions are to follow .
this function is currently not available . currently , the check only takes place when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
the following is an example of a family 1 tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this tag@@ XML file will be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following one example for a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file will be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; function &quot; re@@ turn@@ Type = &quot; void &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; att@@ r name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for re@@ achable using DT@@ D settings . this allows di@@ ed@@ es@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; to edit a &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should create a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; create a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = Use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D statement . ( - / / W@@ 3C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Tran@@ si@@ tional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.0@@ 1 Tran@@ si@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with Settings actions ... created . click New Action leads to the same dialog :
this action assigned keyboard short@@ cut . by clicking the Custom button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ einer , the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed .
the simpl@@ est actions . it can be entered a text in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful type of action . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that can change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) .
first , the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . In this way , try &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the script in the following places : $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we replace the current document URL . in case of a local document file : / removed from the document name .
% pi@@ d : will be replaced with the PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance runs , the text will be attached to the PID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or path to the project file .
in addition to the above mentioned methods , a script can receive input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; input to the default input . in the selection field input can be specified , which is to send to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally only useful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages , to the standard error output . it can be specified , which is to be set with the text written on the default output , setting the selection field output :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create an own toolbar for each group . in the given case , there are not too many , so you can create a toolbar with the name of the mark@@ up .
once a tool bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings actions .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts the edit mode .
fill in all required fields and add the tag to the right tool bar .
complete all and , if the tag has attributes and you plan their use , activate dialog &quot; Edit Tag &quot; when available so that an input is possible when using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is this a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? replace it before we have difficulties .
to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; use . select from the &amp; Menu ; , Graphics More programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses standard 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others .
please note that the created symbol does not only help you remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually considered as loose , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start@@ gt ; tag in the current document will be inserted .
after creating the symbol it has to be connected with the action . this is done via the menu with Settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the saved icon is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the App@@ ly button and continue with other tags , so there is still some , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; functions to the toolbar , or it should be divided to a better overview by some separ@@ ators into several groups . open the toolbar settings dialog via Settings tool slides . make sure that the desired toolbar is selected .
I want to select the separ@@ ator ( at the top left ) for my toolbar . after selecting the element to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the toolbar .
for example , I would like to give you a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the toolbar .
please note how the separ@@ ator support group@@ ing . someone who does not know my toolbar may believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new toolbar must be tested by copying all symbols to make sure everything works .
back up into the right folders . after New@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your toolbar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust their &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that their toolbar ( s ) will be loaded ( s ) when a file is opened by the appropriate type .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory check if someone has done this for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to search for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file .
# K@@ DE Configuration File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = pf@@ ad , relative to this file , for example &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 3.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 1 = func@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 1 = func@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can now see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = php@@ 42 / # top level elements Top Element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Start@@ ed , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = intro@@ duc@@ tion@@ .html ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ ag@@ e.@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of the box ( except for reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
you notice that the Table of Cont@@ ents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folders will be displayed ! ) .
spaces influence nothing , but pay attention &amp; lt ; sign . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; resources will be replaced .
the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file which is used to create context sensitive help . for example , if writing a &amp; PHP ; script will display the documentation for the mysq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . by selecting the function name and pressing C@@ trl ; H for context help , the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file links .
a simple list of context elements separated by a line ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c to $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local and global usage .
if you are sure they are good and worth being shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , such as which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ repository for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the fail@@ ing resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , toolbar with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by e @-@ mail to friends , partners or else who are sent . at different points you can send an email menu item , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , send tool bar toolbar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts tree .
the resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all the other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; users can download them . the contributions are checked and only available if our team has them as correct and useful for publishing . to contribute to a lon@@ ely contribution we recommend to sign the resources , for what it requires a GP@@ G / P@@ GP key . this will ensure the origin of the resources , both for our team and for the later users .
when up@@ loading you will be asked for their private GP@@ G key after their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the event you have several keys , you can choose one . in the New Resource dialog you have to fill out the input fields ( URL previ@@ ew@@ ing can be empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading .
up@@ loading can be uploaded from the D@@ TE@@ P D@@ DT@@ D menu ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , toolbar working toolbar , and started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , still before installation , examine &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing . in case of problems it war@@ ns and it can then be canc@@ eled . please note the warning messages carefully . if the integrity is given and the resource is properly signed , a message appears with the indication of the author of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML languages currently not by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; but creation can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in the tag@@ XML format . there is the simpler way to automatically convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D Load and Con@@ ver@@ ting a DT@@ D . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the DT@@ D description which should be used . after that , the following dialog appears :
destination directory : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written in the $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type Defin@@ i@@ tions@@ zeile : the string that appears in the ! doc@@ type tag , such as HTML PU@@ BLI@@ C - / / W@@ 3C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Tran@@ si@@ tional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d
fine adjustment of D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after conversion the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , there are some key concepts . in order to understand these and get full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze them with these fundamental concepts .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , locally and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; utili@@ zes , available . from Tool@@ bar to actions is all that is marked as global , in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this allows the group of administrators to secure different toolbar , actions and patterns in the global tree , which then are available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool slides . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a particular project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; patterns up to toolbar with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply said this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ o@@ unds the joint use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the building views , the card spre@@ aders with information and the toolbar .
you can click the map line with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document matching entries , such as close the current , other or all the tra@@ ys , rel@@ o@@ ad , delete or upload the document , jump to a bookmark or execution of C@@ VS commands to the current document .
right @-@ click in the editor area guide to another context menu with regard to the edited document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , editing the tags located under the mouse poin@@ ter , using the word under the mouse @-@ cursor or opening the file , when the string is lab@@ eled a file under the mouse @-@ cursor .
at the upper end of the editor window are the toolbar of the editor . at present &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.0@@ 1 Tran@@ si@@ tional as a standard for which a set of tool slides will be shown . in the course of further expansion by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements .
the use of toolbar is really easy . if you want to insert a single tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; paste it into your document , then click the icon that represents the tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( like anchor ) , you can fill different fields in a dialog .
the building man@@ ner@@ ves ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navigate , open and ro@@ am . in the representation of card spre@@ aders are available for files , project , pattern templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view displays all files in the project and allows managing files in the project by right mouse click . actions like addition , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from the storage media can be done with the context menu displayed .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , an entire website &amp; etc . there are all options open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on what context they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; work@@ space . global templates are always available , local templates only available for the corresponding user and templates in projects can only be used in the project .
here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information into a script . further functions are available via the right mouse button , such as starting , editing or sending an email .
with this view , you display the internal structure of the active document . by clicking an element , the cursor in the document is set to the position of the element . by clicking an element , a list of commands will pop up with reference to navigation and refres@@ her of the tree .
this tree appears under the other tree views . with it , man@@ age@@ able attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change . the application system , which is aligned to the content , enables the change of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation of the web @-@ technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be app@@ ended , edited and viewed project @-@ specific documentation .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two card riders at the bottom of the window , via the useful information can be reached : the message window and the problem window .
this tab shows information about each in Qu@@ anta running script . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are shown .
this tab shows all errors in the Mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; scripts executed , give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; Tool@@ bar is extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they will display the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the toolbar is the option of defining your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a toolbar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; sends the toolbar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you receive a toolbar in an email , you can back up and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help .
if you have problems starting from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you should check if your path is the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder contains . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H before their bin folder is located . the same goes for &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
during the effort to create the best &amp; html ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with an obvious idea : what would be , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a stand@@ alone , exp@@ and@@ able Mark@@ up Language editor ? well , this would make him the absolutely amazing web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer for pure &amp; html ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive Web development tool . summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML , then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , then the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be .
now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; follows , in good application of free software , the idea of Why develop what someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ rum@@ ours is not only this all possible , but it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; allows web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . using self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation can increase almost every task .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more information in detail is help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta run ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and managed by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as M@@ anti@@ a am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not located on it , where the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
conver@@ ts the special characters contained in the clip@@ board there , so that they are displayed correctly and are not mis@@ understood by the browser as a form of format@@ ting .
convert the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; writing which is the correct way to include special characters and whit@@ esp@@ ace in &amp; URL ; s . primarily for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s into the anchor tag .
activ@@ ates the block selection . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script error messages are out !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you see the display of script functions and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
switching off the problem rep@@ orter at the lower edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem rep@@ orter is activated once you change to the structure tree .
displays the toolbar at the left of the main window . this column allows you to set bookmark with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries Previous or Next , depending on the cursor position in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Projects are saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
displays a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this enables , for example , to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub @-@ folder and then add them to the project .
loads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; from and if you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO Sl@@ aves ) .
settings such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project manages . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Projects you will find the details explained .
loads a project toolbar . these are stored in project Dir / Tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your toolbar . allows you to select the type of toolbar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . this only creates the name . actions must be set using Settings actions ... Ad@@ ded . Tool@@ bar will be saved by toolbar working toolbar , or you &apos;ll be asked when promp@@ ting whether you want to save the toolbar .
remo@@ ves a toolbar from the field of view . this doesn &apos;t delete it from the disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the toolbar , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do so .
this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team so that the toolbar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as app@@ endi@@ x .
allows up@@ loading toolbar icons to the main server , wherever anyone can access it . see in .
load a &amp; DT@@ D ; which you or anyone else has made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format .
load / refres@@ h the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refresh@@ ed without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not present , the load fails .
this menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded toolbar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) Tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar .
allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub @-@ menus .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this works only with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent past@@ ing means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ ting using tool bar is denied whenever this day contradi@@ cts the rules .
in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug@@ ins are listed under the above listed menu items . click on it . click on an activated plug @-@ in disabled .
cho@@ oses the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on the original ; version .
sel@@ ects the type of line end identification . very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms for development . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document by means of the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
immediate switching between different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , change@@ over sometimes may need time or cause unpleasant graphics . it is recommended by card @-@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub @-@ window . with the selection of an entry the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated .
enables displaying the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window on or off .
the changes in this dialog influence each application using the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
sets the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; works ; you will find details .
a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the toolbar , or which can change the sequences .
this should create a help according to the context of the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , they find here the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should best be filled from top to bottom , as for example after completing the project name the whole directory structure is completed for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties .
here is the name for entering the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case letters and without spaces with the extension ho@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can find the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ examples ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if one leaves this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol are used . depending on the setting of the remote host an adaptation could be necessary .
this is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a shared collection of files for different projects is used , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder in which the toolbar can be saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files for different projects is used , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web@@ content that you want to download and change . with server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
get attached if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project are to be included . if a project is started from scratch , not hook .
with this option , all files and folders within the main folder are displayed and you can make an accurate selection of cou@@ p@@ ons .
this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the desired files by hook or , by removing the tick , clips from the project .
the last screen of the new project wiz@@ ard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project project properties in the menu room in the sub@@ window profiles or Shift ; F@@ 7 can be changed .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholders ) , which will be ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to the top , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project view that is loaded when opening the project . it can be read more about project views .
this allows the de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be set with the Options button . in the case the de@@ bug@@ ging is described .
in the sub@@ window profiles , high @-@ loading profiles ( see in ) can be set as well as display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by showing a separate tree view for each profile .
in the Team configuration window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see details .
in the event configuration window , you can turn event actions and add , change or delete event actions . event actions are executed when a previously defined event occurs , such as the backup of a file . see the details .
by default open &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the last project that was opened .
to open another project , select project ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the toolbar . the dialog project will be displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file is stored automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files will be found . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project manager gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folders behave similarly , but the entries are missing open and open with ... in the right mouse button context menu :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files .
allows removal of the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button will be termin@@ ated to prevent removal .
the password is kept in the core memory and for@@ got at program end . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather un@@ safe password on the disk save option does not come into question .
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , many upload profiles can be created to upload the project ( or parts of the project ) to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog will be displayed :
this is the server name for which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally this does not have to be changed unless the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port .
depending on your threshold , this is either a time saving function or a danger . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so that it cannot be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is just one set of files and toolbar . there can be many views in a project , i.e. by simply changing the view , various files and toolbar can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbar .
views can be saved , opened or deleted from the project or project toolbar , accessible through Settings tool toolbar project toolbar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , with which one has most to do . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to its own working method .
as mentioned above , Tool@@ bar is in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the best way to customize the toolbar menu . use and Ad@@ ding differ . adding tool slides will be discussed below in the Add tool section section .
the toolbar and symbols can be set either using context menu ( right @-@ click on the toolbar ) , in which a new toolbar can be created , other actions such as the toolbar can be removed , nam@@ ing toolbar or toolbar can be set , which can be specified in the dialog where you can specify which actions on this or other toolbar should be visible .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a toolbar , additionally the entries will remove action and action will be displayed that are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the toolbar and actions on them can set up Tool@@ bar settings in the menu ... and set Settings actions .. set .
templates are essentially document skel@@ et@@ ons , code Schn@@ itzel and files for linking . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used templates basically like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any directory available to the system . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the restrictions you imagine for the fil@@ esystem .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions presented at the beginning of each template before use .
binary templates are usually inserted in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the templates tree under global templates .
documents can be written by any text document . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally , more specialized documents can be created in appropriate sub@@ folders . one makes a simple framework for the purpose and organiz@@ es the work in a corresponding way to be efficient . some examples can be found in the templates tree under global templates . see in for more information on the template tree .
this kind of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template but the same text area . you can contain anything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl basis . some examples can be found in the preview room under global templates . see in for more information on the template tree .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole websites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summar@@ ized in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
create a document structure for loading ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and choose File As template Save As Local Template ....
once this has been done , note that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the template tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click File As template save selection as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can simply be drag@@ ged with drag and drop on the tree view template .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used , such as drag and drop or paste over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can click on a folder right in the file tree or in the project file tree view and create a site template , enter a name for the template , but of course it can be stored in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as a local or global template .
project templates enable a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can pret@@ end header lines and foot@@ ers or link them dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; create , paste or link them with them . in addition , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HOME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers as explained above .
to specify the behavior of a folder , right @-@ click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is completed as soon as parent attributes are inher@@ ited .
this is activated by default and fits all except the tri@@ bal folders in the template menu . if a root folder is set so , it would basically disable templates in this path , unless they were explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder the p@@ ale would appear with something like text @-@ building block . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a regular folder .
this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows copying contents templates into a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers to equi@@ p a whole presentation with matching he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have a context menu ( pointing to right mouse button press ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and paste templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provides two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor , which is accessible via the View menu . the first mode replaces the editor window in two parts : the editor window and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ Page and a cursor appears . then you can edit and switch back to source code editor when changes are made in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document containing &amp; PHP ; a small green icon displays the default of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . to edit &amp; PHP ; it is still necessary to edit the source text editor . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that the changes are visible in the source text editor as well as in the V@@ PL ; editor is synchron@@ ously running . pressing F@@ 9 is enabled by this mode , while this mode is already active , the push button is enabled by the active cursor from a window to another , whereby the position in the document is maintained .
the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor can be set up via Settings Qu@@ anta .... After selection of V@@ PL , you can choose between synchron@@ ization after a click or automatically . in general , the recommendation : a small chip for fast calcul@@ ator and a big span for slow .
assuming you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to select document properties . this allows the editing of invisible tags when working with the V@@ PL ; Editor is also called when a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; this is used to reduce the manual encoding . this allows you to change the following :
met@@ a tags permit the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click into the list enables the modification of the content , e.g. key@@ word on the column name and key@@ word key@@ word on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the met@@ a elements . editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file @-@ open button and selecting the appropriate file .
the use of the cursor is possible like in a word processor , by moving with the arrows . under rare circumstances the cursor beha@@ ves peculi@@ arly . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and del@@ eting by means of a back button or remo@@ ve@@ able key .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way about the toolbar , as in the source text editor . it is important to note that inser@@ ting tags before already existing identical tags is not removed , e.g. when a anchor tag is inserted with text , any other surrounding anchor tag must be removed .
some toolbar objects such as the T@@ ables Wiz@@ ard or the Li@@ sts Wiz@@ ard are disabled . they will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release the tables or lists toolbar can be used .
&amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; is a tool for exam@@ ining style sheets . unlike other style sheets , search for certain elements is possible and the style sheet version can be followed .
to compile &amp; x@@ sl@@ db@@ g ; compile successfully , need except &amp; k@@ de ; still libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ;
stop in a template , in a style loaded by x@@ sl@@ db@@ g or the current node . new in x@@ sl@@ db@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode , the most vulnerable stops can be set in a specific file and line number and later activated .
x@@ sl@@ db@@ g returns the full path from a file name without path name . file names in the same folder as the top @-@ loaded layout file name with relative path to the working folder with x@@ sl@@ db@@ g . for example , a style sheet file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l is loaded , the following input is possible :
in this command is checked for a partial or complete agreement with a pre@@ diction called QNAP ME or a specified model name . &amp; eg ; template matches with any QNAP version that contains the string template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP ME &quot; is extended according to the rules specified by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 is &amp; eg ; extended to htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a requested stop point must be resolved for the associated UR@@ I and line number . this is automatically executed when loading the first template through x@@ sl@@ db@@ g .

if a value is given for the &quot; sear@@ ch@@ result sp@@ ath &quot; option , all output files are stored in this folder . otherwise , the folder of the style template is used . in default , the sear@@ ch@@ results .x@@ ml is processed through sear@@ ch@@ .x@@ s@@ l , with the &quot; pre@@ fre@@ html &quot; option is used for the sear@@ ch@@ ht@@ ml@@ .x@@ s@@ l .
if the command &quot; search &quot; is executed , a x@@ ml file called sear@@ ch@@ resul@@ ts@@ .x@@ ml is created . this file can then be edited with a custom style template to display the data in other form , if the option &quot; prefer@@ html &quot; is not set , the file sear@@ ch@@ resul@@ t.@@ txt will be displayed .

on systems with a re@@ ad@@ line library installed , you can use the arrow keys to sc@@ roll down the previously executed commands .
multiple commands require more than one argument . quotes can be used to commit composite expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; &quot; as argument , a stop is set in a file named &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; . &quot;
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name of a template which consists only of the ASCII characters 0x@@ 00 to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a fully qualified name like &quot; x@@ s@@ l : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name . &quot;
fil@@ en@@ ame : a valid local fil@@ en@@ ame on the user &apos;s system . on Unix or cy@@ g@@ win systems , the name may have the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; as a short form for the personal folder .
path : a path to change the working folder . on some operating systems , the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; will be replaced by the path to your personal folder .

there are many graphical tools for comparing . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I have written .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another program@@ mer had changed a lot of text in the same file .
the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I couldn &apos;t see what had changed within these lines . and there was no evidence of the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . mer@@ ging these changes was a little night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could be differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions were added .
for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and insert it in one of the compar@@ ative windows .
a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and mer@@ ging of folders . this function related &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a fully @-@ fle@@ d@@ ged file browser .
even 3 @-@ way merge is fully supported . this is useful if two people work independently from one piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . the scre@@ enshot shows three source files when mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you with comparing and mer@@ ging complete folders . this scre@@ enshot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in folder mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently have to check code , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tab@@ s are displayed visible . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more anno@@ y@@ ance , if somebody changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is the same , and the other is different in one line , the color displays which file is different . red color means that both files differ .
if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can make the typ@@ ing work easier by typ@@ ing only the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 1 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 -@@ o Ziel@@ folder k@@ diff@@ 3 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 Ord@@ ner@@ 2 -@@ o Ziel@@ onne
open dialog allows manual inser@@ ting of fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting a file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the Open dialog will notice your selection and display it next time . you don &apos;t have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed .
selecting a folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the comparison or merge of folders is initiated . if a file is selected for A , but for B and C , a folder , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the two other folders .
when mer@@ ging is checked , the input field is active for the target and can be edited . however , it is not necessary to immediately specify a output file . you can do this step later when saving .
the set @-@ up button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before starting with comparing / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison begins immediately . in open dialog you do not need to select files , you can simply close the dialogue with the Cancel button .
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
which thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to figure out how similar these functions are , this would be a relatively large effort . you would need to create two corresponding files , load them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently , you can do nothing from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the drop down of text into a compar@@ ative window will be supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program than cut and paste ( instead of copy and paste ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) E@@ ach Info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest for a while over the line .
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Settings menu . )
when a difference is recognized , you can see the color which file is different . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . this is good to see in the next section ( mer@@ ging ) .
when differences were found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( for C / C + + e.g. , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few rare cases . )
the vertical line separ@@ ating the summar@@ ization column from the text is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines . if the line breaks are enabled , the line will be dotted with dotted lines .
the result window ( among the compar@@ ative windows ) also has an info line with the in@@ scription output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; changing &#93; when you edited the result . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons Spr@@ inge to next dissolved / un@@ resolved conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ ative windows are used , each difference is also a conflict which needs to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the group belonging to the group will be highlighted in all windows and the first row of the group will be displayed . ( this will also be a jump in the position in the windows where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible . ) This group will then be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black bar .
sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic merge or by manual editing ; then in these lines the text &amp; lt ; No row is displayed in the queu@@ e ; this is only a wild@@ card in the event that you change your opinion and perhaps again choose another source . this text does not appear in the final stored file , nor in a marker that you might want to copy and paste somewhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; context fli@@ ck@@ r ; however , appears in the clip@@ board when you copy such text from the result window . carefully go with this function .
note : if selecting the sources ignor@@ ing the options , ignor@@ ing ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments will also be treated as white characters .
navig@@ ates mainly with the image runs and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , page on , page starting , beginning , end , Str@@ g @-@ start and C@@ trl @-@ end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs .
in the Au@@ ction tab , you can also use the other buttons for editing . with the Insert button , you can switch between inser@@ tion and over@@ write mode . ( default is the inser@@ tion mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as already explained in the section summar@@ izing and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the toolbar contains seven buttons to navigate with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous difference ( C@@ trl @-@ below / C@@ trl @-@ picture Ab@@ wärts ) or to the next / previous conflict .
to copy the marker to the clip@@ board , you need to copy the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ Insert ) . if this is checked , whatever you mark , will be copied automatically to the clip@@ board and manually copying the manual copy . be careful with this option , because you could in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently over@@ ride the contents of the clip@@ board .
line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix variants use a line @-@ feed character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use carri@@ on return + line @-@ feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not retain the line end of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using bin@@ aries .
the options and the list of the last used files will be saved automatically at the end and restored next time . ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... )
choose a font with a fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use it . )
when you activate this option , differences are displayed in ital@@ ics . if the chosen ty@@ pe@@ face does not support this representation , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered to be rendered . on these systems the button pres@@ ets automatically adju@@ sts an odd color .
when this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab@@ ulator button . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator character is inserted .
when you press Enter or Return , the return of the preceding line will be automatically used for the next line .
if this option is checked , each selection will be copied automatically to the clip@@ board . the manual copy to the clip@@ board is then deleted .
you can select which line type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used .
only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step , white characters are ignored . even when mer@@ ging , white characters are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) store a dump trace &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others store only a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; . usually ignored &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the car return mark , but then may be treated with different sizes in page @-@ to @-@ page comparison , but then like a white mark . during mer@@ ging this option must be disabled . in default this is disabled .
in the first part of the analysis , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white characters .
in default this option is disabled . changes in comments will be treated like changes in white characters .
the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow with very large files .
in automatic ski@@ pping mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before going forward to the next un@@ resolved conflict .
sol@@ ves all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if white characters are less important in many files . if you need this only from time to time , then use better the Select A / B / C functions for all un@@ solved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the Automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments , if the options are ignor@@ ing or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments .
these options are dealt with in the chapter to scan folders and execute a merge . look for details under documentation for directory comparison and merge .
if a file is stored and already an older version exists , the original version will be the suff@@ ix .@@ orig . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ orig , it will be deleted without further securing .
adap@@ ts the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current running program . you must quit &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; stop and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is positioned globally across the control center . )
the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries .
using the drop down boxes for coding appears a brief indication of what the local code is . ( this cannot be changed here and has for you purely informal character . )
customize the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the encoding is individually adjustable for each file , even files with different encoding can be compared and merged .
when you edit a file , you can specify which encoding should be used for saving .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files could be a 16 bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option , you can set the encoding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands .
switch off this to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting changes in white characters in the text or summary column . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color co@@ ded text column . but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files . after selecting A &amp; lt ; -@@ GT ; B , A &amp; lt ; -@@ GT ; C , next to the normal yet another over@@ sight column with the required information is displayed .
sometimes you would like to use the space available on the screen for long lines . simply hide the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes consider the differences and then decide ab@@ rup@@ tly to merge the files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as pres@@ et names for output file . ( if this function is used to restart mer@@ ging , then the name of the last used output file is maintained . )
when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that corresponds exactly to your needs . you can use this function for example to cut anno@@ ying parts or to correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it is handed over to this external command first . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used only at line balance . you can write your own pre @-@ processor , which corresponds exactly to your needs . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility when setting the diff results . however , an external program is required , and most users do not want to program themselves . the good news is , however , that in most cases sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient .
use this pre @-@ processing command for line synchron@@ ization to convert the input into upper@@ case : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) \ \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; . * \ \ 1 in the translation string refers to the found text in the first clamp pair . the \ \ U conver@@ ts the found text in upper@@ case .
C@@ VS and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word substitu@@ tion ) . all follow the same pattern $ key@@ word generated text $ . now , the \ \ _ BAR _ Log \ $ \ \ \ _ BAR _ Author \ \ _ BAR _ Log \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ Author \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ Author \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ Author \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ Author \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ Author \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ Author \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ Author \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ Author \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ Author \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ Author \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ Author \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ Author \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ Author \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ Author \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ Author \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ _ BAR _ Author \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \
while you experiment with sed , you may begin to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of a further pre @-@ processing command for line balance . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing , thus quasi deleted .
sometimes you may want to perform several compositions at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other . example :
instead of sed you can also use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replace / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; Ho@@ wever , per@@ l needs some details different . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the prec@@ eded &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be retained for the display and mer@@ ging . the other operations only change the data that the line alignment algorithm looks .
note : in rare cases if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ like pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with each function , the text changes or hidden differences , you may in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often programm@@ ers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge entire folders recur@@ sively .
... makes a suggestion for each object to merge ; you can customize the suggestion before starting ,
... can simul@@ ate the merge and show the simul@@ ated changes without really performing it ,
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging single files . you just need to specify folder in the command line or in the dialog .
if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as the base . if no destination folder is specified , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as the destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not the mer@@ ging . to start mer@@ ging , you need to select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details . )
while reading the folders , you will find a small message window of the current progress . if you ab@@ ort the scanning of the folder , only the files will be listed , which have been compared to that time .
when scanning the folder is complete , displays &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and folder found during the scan is presented here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually worked together . you can fold up a folder by double @-@ clicking on the + / - , or double @-@ clicking on the object , or by folding the arrow keys to the left / right . the directory menu contains two functions All sub@@ directories fold up and all sub@@ directories with which you can open or fold all folders .
when you double @-@ click a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears .
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case the connection pipe action cannot be selected automatically . if the merge is started , you will be informed about problems of this kind .
as seen in the above picture , the colours red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C .
however , with identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered identical when their entire content is identical . then folders have the same color . with folders the age is in@@ significant for its color .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf again , which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , red .
... A and C are identical but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if a folder and B is a file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conf@@ lic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
the mode to synchron@@ ize is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified , and if the option synchron@@ izes directories , then cho@@ oses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then select the necessary action to make sure both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for output file only B ; copied directly after mer@@ ging &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders are merged and the option Select new file instead of merge ( un@@ certain ) , then examined &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; when the files are different , but the same date will appear error : files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such errors are not eliminated , the mer@@ ging of the folders cannot be started .
during mer@@ ging , a file is processed after the other . the status column shows ready when the merge was successful , and according to other messages , if something unexpected occurred . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and check if the status is all right everywhere .
if the file comparison method is selected in the Setup dialog , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display further columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , deleted , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for dissolved conflicts will only be shown if three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all together @-@ time actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start mer@@ ging .
please note : if you do not specify a destination folder , then in the Three @-@ Fol@@ der merge mode C is used as the target , in the two @-@ folder merge , B is selected as the target and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B is used as the target .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check whether all entries should be in the destination folder , also in the folder structure . there are some options that could be ski@@ pped by the specified entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to put only the current item : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if in@@ consistent file types still exist invalid mer@@ ging actions , a message appears that indicates the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialogue window appears with the options through , simul@@ ate and Cancel .
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without the really changes made . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( mer@@ ging a single file ) , then a mer@@ ging window will open ( note the scre@@ enshot ) .
when finished with a file , select / continue directory merge or continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog will appear .
at the end of the list you will see some error messages that should help you identify the cause of the problem . if you continue mer@@ ging the merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , you can choose to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in other ways before proce@@ eding with the merge .
if some entries have been combined individually , the entries ( in the current session ) will not meet again . even if the merge operation has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries are considered to be completed . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Set up Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files matching the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( eg . * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders don &apos;t have to match that pattern .
files and folders that match that pattern are not displayed in the element tree . more than one pattern can be entered , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . pres@@ et@@ ting is * .@@ orig@@ . * .@@ o .
files and folders that match that pattern are not displayed in the element tree . more than one pattern can be entered , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . pres@@ et@@ ting is * .@@ orig@@ . * .@@ o .
ignor@@ es files that would also be ignored by C@@ VS . many aut@@ ot@@ cally created files are ignored by C@@ VS . the big advantage is that this folder @-@ specific can be set with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files have a default attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems a prec@@ urs@@ . a file is marked as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the Element@@ bau or not . this option is enabled in default .
links to files : when the option is turned off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default .
links to folders : when the option is turned off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is turned on , the links will be treated like normal folders and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not checked for possible recur@@ sions . a link to a folder containing a link to itself would result in an infinite loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; cr@@ ashes down . ) This option is switched off in default .
performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the stati@@ stic columns . ( the number of dissolved , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is s@@ lower than a simple binary analysis , and much s@@ lower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders using a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the chan@@ gel@@ date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you some degree of security . please use caution . this option is turned off in default .
similar to confidentiality of the change date . there is no real comparison instead . the files are considered identical if they are equal to size . this can be useful , for example , when copying the modification date . please use caution . this option is turned off in default .
activ@@ ates the synchron@@ ize mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified . in this mode the suggestions for mer@@ ging will be selected in such a way that both folders are identical . also , the results of mer@@ ging files are saved in both folders . this option is switched off in default .
if there are differences , instead of mer@@ ging the newer file , it is suggested as an action . ( this is considered in@@ secure , because it will assume the knowledge that the other file has not been modified too . you should check this in any case . ) This option is disabled in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version will ren@@ ame and receive the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file exists with the .@@ original extension , this will also be deleted without further backup . this also concerns the normal mer@@ ging of individual files , not only the merge whole folder . this option is enabled in default .
normally the folder merge @-@ view remains visible to mer@@ ging individual files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can switch the option directory &amp; text window to switch main window in the window menu and switch between the two views through change between directory &amp; text window .
you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge . to do so , use the current file merge from the merge menu . once you save the result , the status will be reset and the file will not be merged once you start the folder merge .
however , this status will be lost if you re @-@ read the directory again : directory -@@ Menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO Sl@@ aves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open that are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive to a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a few things should be noted :
a path can be relative to und@@ . or .. contain . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , idle &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then a file is always assumed as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit the per@@ missions or modification date . therefore , the per@@ missions or the modification date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option of confidentiality of the size . ) ( This is only possible for local files . )
the main purpose is currently as a difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ VEL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ VEL@@ OP begins always the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the differences viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part view from the context menu .
normally it requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is used as a part , it takes a patch file in unified format . then it remo@@ ves &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; running as part , it only supports comparing two files , a very small toolbar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools named K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now there are compli@@ ments ) are already available . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection .
I &apos;ve been using GPL programs for quite a long time and learned a lot by getting into the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programm@@ ers who have gone this way or are going to go that way .
you probably compiled the program from the sources and probably didn &apos;t tell the configure script to K@@ DE . configure the configure script in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ ui@@ .@@ r@@ c ) . see the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file for more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are first treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white mark is different , the line is considered not identical . i@@ F custom lines App@@ ear next to each other , this actually is coinci@@ dence but this place is more often the case .
this important information is lost if the result is simply saved by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information .
the effort for this has been too large so far . you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c swe@@ pt ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does this mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to empha@@ size differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and mis@@ ses the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
you can find a list of the latest changes under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log , or chan@@ gel@@ Log in the source package .
to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir returns the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find more details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file .
as &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should not have problems with comp@@ iling . should nevertheless occur , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists of it .
cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift Del@@ ete ) copy into the clip@@ board and er@@ ase the selected text . paste ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift @-@ Insert ) insert the text from the clip@@ board at the current cursor position or replace the current marking .
only show differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder .
( in the current program version , you must ren@@ ew the folder with the Update function after changes to these options . )
this also means that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder when mer@@ ging . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after the merge . ( the behavior will probably be modified in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default .
note the buttons to select the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if the lines are already present ) , they will be removed by clicking on the button .
in default this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite practical to see the running programs on the desktop , change their size , stop them or move them . this works both inside a working area and at several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a working area and on other des@@ kt@@ ops .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when clicking on the empty Back@@ ground of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the context menu has only the two entries to set up ... and Finish . if however , click on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; however , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minim@@ ise , maxim@@ ize , on Desktop and Finish . the commands effect the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is checked , window within the &amp; pad@@ stack ; s can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other des@@ kt@@ ops .
when this field is checked , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the names of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops appear .
cross this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; view the numbers of virtual desktop . if it is displayed together with name , the names are provided with ord@@ inal numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st working area .
when this field is checked , the background of each desktop will also be displayed as background in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
if this field is checked , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty areas of work will be displayed to facilitate their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rectang@@ les with the proportions of the program window . icon displays the window with its default icon and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classical lets &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n grid , appear , as from p@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizontal displays all virtual work@@ spaces in a horizontal and vertical line , which is very good for representation at the side of the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size that can display and move windows as symbols or with their contents .
right click inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then set up sel@@ ector sel@@ ections ... allows the dialog to appear .
currently , this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog . however , you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor , such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you don &apos;t have a write permission for the file , you need to login as root or turn to your system administrator .
da &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package k@@ de@@ base , you need a functioning installation of the K@@ DE base packages .

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a screen lu@@ pe . you can use &amp; k@@ mag to enlarge a part of the screen , as if you read a magni@@ fying glass for small print or accurate viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for different users : this includes artists , web designers and people with visual imp@@ air@@ ment . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for use of &amp; k@@ mag .
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that constantly extends to new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance computers .
if you start &amp; k@@ mag , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; displays the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window is called magni@@ fying window . the image , which is displayed in the magni@@ fication window , is an enlarged area of the screen and is described below as a selection window .
in the default setting &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter as a mobile magni@@ fying glass . alternatively , you can &amp; k@@ mag ; for this cause a selected screen area in the magni@@ fication window ( drop down mode ) or the setting of the mouse cursor at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) .
would you like to avoid that the mouse poin@@ ter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse cursor position . please note that &amp; k@@ mag ; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter .
in the drop down mode , you can customize the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse cursor to the magni@@ fication window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fier window . this also works with the arrow keys .
if you add the &amp; Shift key in addition , press the &amp; M@@ MB , you can move the selection window .
with this combination you can change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window stays tight and only the bottom right corner is to move .
&amp; k@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , save it into a file , copy it to the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rot@@ ate the image and much more .
starts or stops the update of the ad . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode a selection window will appear . the selected area will be displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands to store files , open a new window , printing , ne@@ ul@@ fs ( with the button re@@ charge the document in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ lar@@ gement &amp; Redu@@ ction &amp; etc ; .
k@@ mag also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen lu@@ pe . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; to use a magni@@ fier area , as if you would use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visually imp@@ aired .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click once the mouse poin@@ ter per@@ si@@ sts for a while in the same place . it is meant to help people who suffer from the Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( RS@@ I ) syndrome and those of any mouse click pain . furthermore , it can em@@ ulate pulling with the mouse . however , this requires a little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can b@@ ypass the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may also suffer from pain caused by using your computer , you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done .
to make it clear : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aids : the result can be different for everyone .
using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click once you break the motion shortly .
if the intelligent move is activated , power &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after pressing the mouse button . move now the mouse , wait until the end of the motion before rele@@ asing the mouse button . in this way , you can execute the drag@@ ging with pressed mouse button . the intelligent move requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this wei@@ ght@@ time must be pet@@ ri@@ fied after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click exec@@ utes .
if Intel@@ lig@@ entes shift on , the shooting range is active ( 1 / 10 s ) active . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after shut down the mouse button wait until it lets the mouse button again if there is no moving of the mouse .
this function activ@@ ates , generates a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt , when it is started , but they can be changed later .
when the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to sh@@ orten response time . go to the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose Sound System and here the tab General . there is a slider sound buffer that you set to a lower value to sh@@ orten the response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will start ; at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; start . this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; please consult the respective documentation for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments to find out how to start a program automatically .
set all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the App@@ lic@@ ator button , the settings will be reset to the stand after the last push of the user .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the pres@@ ets . in particular , the intelligent move should first be switched off . if you have become ac@@ custom@@ ed to the automatic mouse click , you can later add the intelligent move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times by &amp; k@@ de ; to reduce sounds .
first , you should make yourself aware of which places a mouse click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral elements of windows or in places in the browser window that do not represent a link does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use it again .
when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you not only clean the mouse ball , but also the rollers that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you have to take the mouse ball out . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rollers . these are located at the sides of the hole into which the ball was inserted . the dirt and dirt can be easily scrat@@ ched with a flat blade or a finger nail .
in very rare situations , the operating system breaks the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use the intelligent move in this case , that means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be termin@@ ated by rele@@ asing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; using a different window manager and moving a window .
the solution for this problem is that you yourself perform a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cursor in another position .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor wherever you want it . however , drag the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop when you want to make a keyboard input . thus , a acci@@ dental move of the mouse &amp; eg can cause unwanted reactions . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the front lines of windows .
I try to work with intelligent shifting , but I do not manage to edit text .
the intelligent move is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very probably possible to mark this way to copy it to the clip@@ board or to execute any other action you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button .
do not use the intelligent move if you just start using it &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select text instead : hold a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key while drag@@ ging the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick . this will each time , if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click . then you know exactly when when intelligent shifting begins the shooting time . later you can use the intelligent move even without the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick . but this requires some practice .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to be able to use , the X@@ Test extension needs to be installed for &amp; X Window ; that should be already the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and is set up correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter per@@ si@@ sts . this program was developed for people suffering from the RS@@ I syndrome and causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to allow a specific time waiting for a drag process to start before the mouse button is released . in this way also the drag and drop can be done with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program with which silent users can let their computer speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , dum@@ b users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose phrases which are to be spoken again from a list with the conversation process .
on the first page of the assistant ( left scre@@ enshot ) , enter the command , which will be used later for the speech output of text . for more details , please refer to the description of the catalogue of information .
on the second page , select the default text pass@@ book book . from the text passages you can often choose text passages without having to type them . the text passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right screen shot ) you determine the dictionary for the word reproduction . &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . in addition , you can synchron@@ ize the wor@@ d@@ lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only properly speaking words can be added to the word .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard input of your pro@@ positions ( the lower white field in the scre@@ enshot ) and a disk space of the already spoken phrases ( the upper white field in the scre@@ enshot ) .
if you have k@@ mouth ; correctly set up , you can input the phrases you want to hear in the input field . each spoken set is app@@ ended to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . you can choose from it phrases which are to be spoken again .
with the menu entry preferences k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog contains two card cards , voice output and settings , page Wor@@ ter@@ gän@@ zung , as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the card language edition , enter the command to call the language generator . in the drop @-@ down field below the input field , specify the encoding , with which text is passed on to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass on the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed on as default to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text is passed on as a parameter . you can use the following wild@@ cards :
of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation for your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
use this option as voice service &amp; k@@ mouth ; first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the other settings on this page are ignored . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ da@@ emon , the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications will provide a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the Text passages book or in the bar for text pass@@ ag@@ ings .
the selected text passage is spoken directly with the selection of In In the input field . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is entered first only into the input field .
with the second drop @-@ down box of the editing window for the text@@ book book , you can specify whether the text@@ book book should be automatically saved when closing the editing window .
when you choose to change the book , the book will be saved . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text@@ book book will not be saved . choose Before saving , it becomes &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text@@ book is to be saved .
the Wor@@ ter@@ gän@@ zung side contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the word reproduction . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection field , if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this drop @-@ down box , you can choose the currently used dictionary for word reproduction .
with buttons on the right of the page you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the name and the dictionary in the input field the language for the dictionary .
select the language you want for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then reads the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of each word is simply evaluated by counting the occurrence . additionally , you can compare the wor@@ d@@ list using an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they are to be weigh@@ ted .
with this option , create a new , empty dictionary with no entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly added words automatically insert into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time .
the main area of the window for processing text pass@@ ag@@ ings is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are displayed as a tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated short@@ cut . if you have selected a text pass@@ book , you can only change its name .
add actions such as new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either by selecting the menu bar , toolbar or pop @-@ up menu .
the order of text passages or text passages can change by drag@@ ging with the mouse to the new position or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used otherwise the selected areas of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory .
the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used otherwise the selected areas of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory .
the currently active pro@@ position is spoken . if text is in the input field , it will be used otherwise the selected pro@@ positions of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory .
if this item is checked , a sliding tool bar is displayed with buttons for frequently used commands . the toolbar can be moved directly from the editing pane directly under the menu bar . clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag the toolbar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is checked , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; indicated , if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this item is checked , a sliding bar is displayed for text pass@@ ag@@ ings with entries . the bar is mounted by default via the editing window directly below the toolbar . clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag the toolbar can be moved to another location .
you probably have not entered the command for the voice output correctly or not completely . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the page General Settings and enter the command for the voice output on the card language version . ( see settings dialog for voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers for further details . )
Festival is a speech @-@ edition system from the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Malay@@ al@@ am are supported . the license allows to use the festival for free and without any restrictions .
to display an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder .
Free@@ TTS is a language generator written in &amp; Java . currently it only supports the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows to use Free@@ TTS free of charge and without any restrictions .
to display an example of the command line to set up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ TTS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ ett folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option must be switched on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of using Free@@ TTS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of phon@@ em@@ es to a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei so you need an additional program to disman@@ tle the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax would like to swal@@ low the last character of the text so that an additional character has to be added . therefore , the complete command is more complex than in the other examples :
( Cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BAR _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 - / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as default input must be turned on .
the voice output da@@ emon by &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
since the setting of the language generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a voice service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
to set up , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but this depends on the individual from your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application that allows people who cannot talk to output text by calcul@@ ator . a list of already spoken phrases can be saved , which the user can always re@@ charge .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; does not include a syn@@ thesizer . a voice syn@@ thesizer must be installed on the computer .
you will find more detailed user documentation with help : / k@@ mouth ( either enter this URL into the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or launch k@@ help@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; - the Sprach@@ ausgabe system von &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service that allows any application to read text about the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; is a partial system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( TTS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programm@@ ers ready to be equipped with their applications with TTS @-@ skills . users also offer interesting possibilities .
reading of texts ( or parts thereof ) in text editor &amp; works ; even if &amp; works ; in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications embedded .
the speech output is done via the program speech audi@@ ble pat@@ cher , which uses different background programs like e@@ Spe@@ ak , festival , &amp; etc .
allows creation of language editions on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; -@@ help program .

in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( htt@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you can find the list of htt@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ mail . the developers can also be found in IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # k@@ de @-@ div ) .
before you can use &amp; kt@@ ops , you need to install program speech and set it correctly . see also
when the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as no speaker is set up , the card card spokes@@ man will appear . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the card card will appear in general . see .
most TTS Syn@@ thesi@@ zers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those , which differ in volume or speed . you can also set up several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least set up a speaker before you use &amp; kt@@ ops ; use as the speed dis@@ pat@@ cher otherwise uses the default speaker .
different speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable with multiple printer drivers for the same printer .
if you click on the tab speaker in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the card card spokes@@ man will appear . this will also appear automatically when you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and no speaker is set up .
all the speakers already created will appear in this list . the top speakers will appear in the list . the top speaker is used for voice output if there is no speaker .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click this button to remove the speaker from the list .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click this button to change the settings . see below .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click this button to move the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ops .
select a type of tuning here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girl &apos;s voice to choose from .
when you click here , the new speaker will appear on the map board spokes@@ man . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ops . go back to the card tab General and check whether voice output is checked ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is checked for the TTS service from &amp; k@@ de ; start . see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ops . click on the map orders to create and manage text orders . see .
if you have set up at least one speaker , you can start the language output system of &amp; k@@ de ; click on the card in general to open this map . here you can set some general options .
select this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ops ; this starts the K@@ DE TTS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this starts the K@@ DE TTS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card card orders will be displayed and you can set up text orders and read the TTS @-@ System of &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
if kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is termin@@ ated , runs &amp; kt@@ ops ; further if the field is checked ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is checked .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr will appear automatically in the system area of the control bar , it dis@@ appears once the read is completed .
with buttons in this series , you can start , ab@@ ort , pause , and res@@ ume text applications .
the buttons in this series allow you to read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board or open a text file to read . you can also switch the speaker for an order .
click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings are taken on all sides .
the card card orders will only be displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the General tab of General and tick voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . first check whether &amp; kt@@ ops ; runs . then select the text that should be read , and select Tools in the main menu . after a short time the voice output should begin .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; he@@ aders and other invisible brands are also read .
in &amp; ate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the displayed text . check first , if &amp; kt@@ ops ; runs . then select the text that should be read , and select Tools in the main menu . then the voice output should begin .
this also works if &amp; works ; in other applications embedded , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; which noti@@ fies you about events you set . you can also read the text of this news by &amp; kt@@ ops .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up different types of messages . you can set up &amp; conversation ; for example , establish that you will be notified when a message appears in an IR@@ C channel , in which your nick@@ name appears . by &amp; kt@@ ops , you can then read the IR@@ C message text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry will appear in the Settings menu of this program . the settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application .
the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is included in the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ops , is a good example . it remo@@ ves the tags br and b from the messages sent by mail , and also the print@@ out / local / in@@ box , since it can be assumed in most cases as pres@@ upp@@ os@@ ed .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ops ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ops , filters are not required .
filters are processed in filters before being sent to the speech speech tool . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unci@@ ation to replace false spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker or to deal with certain short@@ com@@ ings of syn@@ thesi@@ zers and their voices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to understand the functioning of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works with a text . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it will be with@@ drawn from all other orders and will hold these orders . if the output of the Screen @-@ Reader is read , the retained orders will be res@@ umed .
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important messages like &amp; eg ; Proc@@ essor is subject to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these assign@@ ments will res@@ ume after issue of warning .
News have the next highest priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; read a long text on a website , you can talk to &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who just enters the room . &amp; k@@ de ; al@@ erts are also messages . read this .
the rest are simple text orders . each order that you initiate by the card card is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of an application that uses text applications . text applications are intended for the output of longer texts , which do not have any special ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in queu@@ es except for the output of Screen re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ops ; just one such pres@@ et , this issue will be hal@@ ted and stopped .
first , you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , messages and text messages as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filters process the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can be even further types of filters .
strings replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ops ; will be provided with pre@@ defined string plac@@ ards , which enable the creation of chat @-@ emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for reform@@ at@@ ting messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intel@@ li@@ gible form .
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to another format . included in the scope of delivery ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files to translate &amp; X@@ HTML ; included in SS@@ ML .
with speaker selection filters , you can send assign@@ ments depending on the content of the text or depending on the program , which has sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ops . for example , if you have set a female voice on the card card spokes@@ man , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . read Si@@ eh@@ e .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied to voice output . if the filter states that its rules are not true , it will pass the text unchanged to the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or &amp; k@@ de ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ops ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters that were set up on the page . editing through the filters is performed in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filter will be processed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the following setup di@@ alogs will be shown below .
for setting string offset filters , you must type a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern . if these patterns are found in the text , then the text is exchanged for the equivalent replacement text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name , it only needs to be distinguished from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column match and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Er@@ Set . the list is processed in the order from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . load a list from a file , the entries from the file are attached to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter is only applied if the spokes@@ person for the text order speaks one of the languages listed here . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ trl key when you click the mouse .
if a value is entered here , the filter is only applied if the text is from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separately by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID running programs will get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers have to leave you . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID Kop@@ et @-@ 34@@ 32 shows , you can only enter cop@@ ete .
the string offset filter is applied only to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter when matching . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the string substitu@@ tion filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s Word \ \ s . so the words must be limited by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . however , if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions installed , you can use it in the di@@ alogs add or edit as help to assemble these expressions . the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package k@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls .
XML ; conver@@ ters translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from a format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such transform@@ ations . however , it can only be applied to well formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility needs to be installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the environment variable PAT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient .
with the speaker selection filter , you can send text to a specific speaker that is set up on the card speaker , or to a speaker with specific features . for example , you can specify that text by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ops ; gives a text to the filters , there is a spokes@@ person for the text . the speaker is selected based on the spokes@@ person properties , which speci@@ fies the text to &amp; kt@@ ops ; sends , and the features of the speaker designed on the card board speaker . with the speaker selection filter you can over@@ write the selected spokes@@ man .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions installed , you can access it by clicking on the button to get help during input .
to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the properties of the speaker that you would like to use . if the text comp@@ lies with the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected to meet the desired requirements . click on the button on the right to view the dialog box .
use these buttons to save or load your subscri@@ ber settings or delete all settings .
the speaker selection filter is applied only to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter when applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with the program@@ mer can give their applications TTS @-@ abilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so you can use this syn@@ thesizer .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the voice output API by &amp; k@@ de ; see the full documentation for both AP@@ Is on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility website ( htt@@ p : / / accessi@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .

none of the mentioned language syn@@ thesi@@ zers support my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; Modi@@ fy filter , but when using the module for festival websites are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you have to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so that SAB@@ LE will work at all . you must also do that if you do not use this voice to read web pages . also ensure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found through the environment variable PAT@@ H .
certain signs or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause errors in the syn@@ thesizer , so that whole pro@@ positions are ski@@ pped or only ch@@ ew@@ ing wel@@ sh . what can I do about it ?
first of all , ensure that the string encoding option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , you may be able to fix it through a string set filter .

the syn@@ thesi@@ zers used by &amp; kt@@ ops have their own license , which you can find in the related documentation or on the websites concerned . there are also voices which have their own license .
if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the package with &amp; kt@@ ops . you can also download it in the kt@@ ts@@ d directory . in addition , you will find the source code from k@@ de@@ fraud under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .
contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages on the web page htt@@ p : / / espe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es@@ .html .
American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ bio .
KT@@ TS works with any voice syn@@ thesizer , which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console .
the list of the above languages may be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , drag the description of the syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . check also on the website of kt@@ ops ; , for information not included in this manual .
the speech tool &quot; speech audi@@ cher &quot; uses a custom@@ iz@@ able module architecture for voice syn@@ thesi@@ zers . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ops for the use of another syn@@ thesizer , contact the developer team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; but is not mandatory . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
to compile &amp; kt@@ ops , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including the packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; speech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher . &quot;
if you refer to the source text of &amp; kt@@ ops ; from the source code archive for k@@ de@@ fraud , or have downloaded the tar@@ ball current every night , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before you use &amp; kt@@ ops , check first if speech audi@@ ble is working properly with your voice syn@@ thesizer . you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf to do so .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of speech ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be developed in such a way that the set up of speech words is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is divided into individual sentences . the user can leave a sentence or paragraph , repeat , stop or ab@@ ort output .
if an application has text on &amp; kt@@ ops , you can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for output . for example , if you have set up a speaker , whose language is English and whose sex is female , it is used otherwise the best fitting speaker will be selected . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ops ; select a spokes@@ person , you will see them .
if you click Add @-@ on to add a spokes@@ man to the list or click Edit , the Map Editor Device will be displayed . for example , below is the setup of the module for Festival Interactive . details on the modules can be found below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival in PAT@@ H is included , you only have to enter a festival .
select the encoding for text that is passed to festival . for voices , the &amp; kt@@ ops ; known , this setting is automatically made . generally , Western languages are using ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders you set the volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select a few kno@@ bs and display this grey , the voice you selected does not allow these settings to be displayed .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n @-@ voices need to be loaded several seconds on account of their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded when starting K@@ TT@@ SD , so that the first movement is syn@@ thesi@@ zed faster than the first set .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet established a speaker ( or to click App@@ ly ) .
if this check box is selected , the t@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is displayed on the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr . otherwise , only the symbol kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not run , it appears in the system area when K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to stop reading or otherwise control the read .
here all orders in the queu@@ e are listed , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of pro@@ positions and the just processed pro@@ position . the Sp@@ okes@@ man ID corresponds to the column ID on the card card spokes@@ man .
with buttons in this row , you can proceed or go back in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sentences ) .
by clicking on the OK button , all changes in the settings ( also on the other card cards ) will be res@@ ized and t@@ t@@ sm@@ gr will be res@@ ized to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stream@@ er or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the Map Audio . see also .
here only text records are listed and managed . output of Screen Re@@ aders , war@@ nings and messages will not be displayed . for more information on the news types of &amp; kt@@ ops you will find in .
here you can choose the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , it was compiled ; either without support for the appropriate audio module or you can &apos;t load the necessary libraries .
if you want to use G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de for the audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the speech speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ nbsp ; % such as the double normal speaking speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be installed so@@ x .
click App@@ ly to take over the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ops .
the list of AL@@ SA tools includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out which device works with you . in doubt , select standard .
on this tab , you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ops ; processes four types of language orders :
the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it will be with@@ drawn to all other orders and holds these orders . after the output of the Screen @-@ Reader has been read , the retained orders are res@@ umed .
war@@ nings have the next higher priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; Proc@@ essor is subject to hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these assign@@ ments will res@@ ume after reading the warning .
News have the next priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that pron@@ oun@@ ces messages . if you leave &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a website , you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless welcome someone who just enters the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ops ; the audio output into the queu@@ e .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both intro@@ duc@@ tory sound and intro@@ duc@@ tory message are active , the intro@@ duc@@ tory sound is played before the intro@@ duc@@ tory message .
the settings on this map are only valid for normal text orders . for messages , al@@ erts and the output of Screen Re@@ aders , there are no special promotions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ops ; read K@@ Noti@@ fy messages , start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click noti@@ fications . the map notification will appear .
select this check box to enable the read of &amp; k@@ de ; dis@@ advant@@ es . if this setting is not checked , the other settings are disabled and reads ; reads no noti@@ fications .
if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ops ; not read .
use these buttons to add or delete events on the list . if you click the Add button , a dialog will appear where you can select the application and event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone mentioned your nick@@ name in an IR@@ C message .
all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ops .
use this drop down field to specify what &amp; kt@@ ops ; do when an event arrives . you have the following choices :
if you have selected Custom Text , enter the text you want . you can use the following wild@@ cards :
you can enter the properties of the desired speaker here . default cho@@ oses the speaker that is displayed in the list on the card Spe@@ aker as the top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is defined for a specific event of a specific application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application .
the Event All noti@@ fications for the application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can specify the noti@@ fications as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for the noti@@ fications in a file . the loaded events are merged with events in the list . if you want to start using an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except All Noti@@ fications are deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to highlight text for voice output . this standard contains trademarks for controlling voices , speaking speed , sound level , gender , voice and pitch .
currently , &amp; kt@@ ops ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following limitations exist :
you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) as this is the standard voice used to use the festival in the output of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ nbsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ ot@@ on@@ ously .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and set limits filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds sign text into individual pro@@ positions . this allows &amp; kt@@ ops to start earlier , since only the first set must be syn@@ thesi@@ zed , not the entire text order .
here you see the set limits filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ops , a set limit indicator filter is set up automatically as a default . you can change its settings or add additional set limits filters , but beginners will be advised .
the simpl@@ est way to set up the speaker selection by trying out . switch off the speaker selection and select text to read . switch the speaker selection again , change some properties and check how the choice of the speaker is changed . of course , you have to have more than one speaker set up , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; then start reading faster , since only the first sentence has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
you can then pause or ab@@ ort text messages on the map card , even if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal typ@@ ing indicator filter is set up automatically when you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything at this filter unless you know what you are doing .
set limits filters compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and add a tab@@ ulation sign ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the set limits ( tab characters are removed from the text automatically before filtering ) . note that the standard set limits filter preser@@ ves the character set .
S@@ BD filters are never used on &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ war@@ nings ) , war@@ nings , messages , or output of Screen re@@ aders .
if you have removed the normal set limits filter from failure , you can paste it again by loading the standard _ sb@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ops .
on the Map menu item selection , you can over@@ write the subscri@@ ber settings for the application . the card card is displayed if
use of the default speaker ( the top on the card spokes@@ man ) . in other words : no talk properties are specified .
use of the most appropriate speaker that has all the properties of a set @-@ up speaker . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , select &amp; kt@@ ops . otherwise choose &amp; kt@@ ops ; the speaker that is most likely to correspond to the original settings .
select the method to input the desired subscri@@ ber properties by clicking on one of the buttons .
select the properties of the desired speaker here . if this property does not play any role , do not enter anything .
select this check box if the property should have priority over other properties . you can also set several mark@@ ers here .
since the language is a critical factor in issu@@ ing the issue , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this feature . the only case you possibly want to specify the attribute language is ahead if you know that a particular application sends text in another language than the one in the working environment .
to use all the features in the area of Spe@@ aker , which is most likely to be deleted , click on the Def@@ ault Spe@@ aker and then use Spe@@ aker , which is most likely to follow the following .
in this case 0 is for the last text order in the queu@@ e . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number , the input 0 is required ) .
kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr down@@ stairs immediately when it is started . I compiled de@@ bug support , but I get no trace .
G@@ Stream@@ er has crashed and &amp; kt@@ ops . probably you have to register G@@ Stream@@ er . G@@ Stream@@ er 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command g@@ st @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not solved this may be a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stream@@ er . you can try upgra@@ ding or un@@ installing G@@ Stream@@ er .
the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application . if I get a text order , fre@@ eze &amp; kt@@ ops ; one . on the &amp; console ; appears a message that says : &apos; I to open PC@@ M .
on your system , the problem is that conflicts arise at AL@@ SA , which prevent a simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . information for possible solutions can be found on the AL@@ SA project website ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I have uploaded an additional voice for festival from the internet . I have installed it and can use it in the festival but t@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not show this voice .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / f@@ estiv@@ al@@ int / vocals . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developers .
on the audio card audio there is a setting speed . in order for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and can be found on the environment variable PAT@@ H . some syn@@ thesi@@ zer@@ modul@@ s such as festival Interactive also offer a setting for speed on the map for subscri@@ ber units . depending on the selected voice , it is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speech speed are ignored , if &amp; kt@@ ops ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because the HTML is converted into SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for conversion from &amp; HTML ; by &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite cour@@ ageous , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of &amp; html ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML trans@@ former filter , and set the speech speed up .
I do not manage to read websites with a female voice . I set up a female festival speaker but &amp; kt@@ ops . read the websites with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day SAB@@ LE GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . so that festival does not produce any mistakes , the x@@ s@@ l file thro@@ ws the X@@ s@@ l file to convert SS@@ ML to S@@ aber die GEN@@ DER @-@ Tags . the same goes for VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added an own string setup filter and now I can go into &amp; kt@@ ops ; no more set up or go back . on the tab job is displayed , the order is only from one set . what do I do wrong ?
pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( dot , question mark , excl@@ am@@ ation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) must not filter out . use a filter for the detection limit detection instead .
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )

some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts in the audio output . if your system counts , you cannot simultaneously play music and let a text read . &amp; kt@@ ats ; also freezes when you stop a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) website .
with Stand July 2005 a@@ Ko@@ de does not support any real breaks . if you stop a text order in &amp; kt@@ ops , the current set will still be read .
the audio program so@@ x is used for general setting of speaking speed , but otherwise it is not mandatory . Debian users can install so@@ x with the apt @-@ get install so@@ x command . the program is included in most &amp; Linux ; CDs already included .

before you use &amp; kt@@ ops , check first if your voice syn@@ thesizer works correctly . follow the instructions you have received with the syn@@ thesizer .
Festival is one of the best free TTS Syn@@ thesi@@ zers whose source code is revealed . the quality of the voices is generally good and there are several voices and languages supported .
you must install at least one language . help with this you will find in the instructions provided with festival . if you want to read web pages , you must install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you have to compile an extra module , so you need the source code of festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on .
the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / lib / vocals / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you must enter the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ N@@ SH _ di@@ phone . choose a Cyr@@ il@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , search for festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech language , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to a 8 @-@ bit Cyr@@ il@@ lic , such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA syn@@ thesizer . then , Festival takes over the lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no full voice output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from Di@@ phon files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . Festival generates this by &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce di@@ phone from German texts .
in this procedure , additional wr@@ apper code will be added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA will not be installed in &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA , but in the festival / lib / . manuals you will find under
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; Vo@@ ices . required is either Festival Version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival of
instructions can be found in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file in the package you have downloaded .

on some systems you need to edit the file / etc / f@@ estiv@@ al@@ .@@ sc@@ m . just add the lines for your installed German voices . replace the correct path in / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / . at the time of creating this manual , the German DE@@ 4 , de@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 voices do not work with I@@ MS German Festival .
this procedure uses special code to give the language of the festival with a Czech &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; obtain and install first festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and make sure both of them work .
extract the program with tar into a suitable folder and create the enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pedia . the exec@@ utable file festival must be located in your PAT@@ H .

EP@@ OS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener voice syn@@ thesizer for the Czech and Slovak language . it is a simple voice syn@@ thesizer with even sufficient voice quality .
start kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr . on the tab ator click Add . select the Czech or Slovak language and Epo@@ s TTS @-@ language syn@@ thesizer . if the EP@@ s programs are not in your PAT@@ H , enter the path to the programs on the map board speaker . in the input fields you can enter additional parameters for the programs . enter in a &amp; console ; Epo@@ s -@@ h or say -@@ h to get more information .
Free@@ TTS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener voice syn@@ thesizer , written in &amp; Java , i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; you can set neither pitch , volume or speaking speed .
the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ops ; with any voice syn@@ thesizer , which can be controlled in a &amp; console ; on the command line .
it is best to use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device .
this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center , which allows management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center .
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ controll@@ l@@ center ; create a simple interface for the user :
after installation , a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ controll@@ l@@ center will be displayed . the network settings module ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ controll@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to allow &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all shows and allows setting of network features .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices will be installed and set up for network hardware and other devices . if network devices are added later , drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files , according to the kernel version :
the network settings module is loaded when the network settings option is selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; index . when starting the module network settings , this will automatically detect the platform used on the system .
if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to select which the distribution and release are best . by selecting the setting non @-@ recur@@ ring issues , the definition can be made permanently .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , meaning the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . in system management mode , you can access system management mode at the right lower end of the module . it is required to enter the password .
in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three tab@@ s :
the Reiter Network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the Reiter Network interfaces , the following tasks can be performed :
the settings displayed on display can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... set up in the device dialog .
by default only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings dialog displays the dialog with further options .
the automatic mode calls the TCP / IP settings from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . the DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP information for each system start , so no further setting is required . in the selection list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system , can be selected .
with the choice manual , without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , the TCP / IP configuration can be made . in the IP address input field , the required TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field network mask the sub@@ net mask must be set .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface in boot . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the unit i@@ ste .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off depending on the need . switching off a switched network device is enabled by selecting from the list and clicking the interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off depending on the need . off @-@ off of an activated network device can be de@@ activated by selecting from the list and clicking the interface ....
speci@@ fies the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ net , which transm@@ its the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network where the gateway computer is located .
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain attack by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer requests htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS dis@@ sol@@ ves this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 45.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the host name resolution calcul@@ ator allows easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed , or changed .
clicking the button Add ... from batch calcul@@ ator to name resolution can be added to a DNS server . it will be added to the New nam@@ eser@@ ver dialog .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry is then inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... It will appear the Edit dialog .
the list of names known by name describes computer name @-@ to @-@ IP address links for TCP / IP Sub@@ system . it is primarily used when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks it can replace DNS servers .
usually the list contains some known hosts some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this still in the test version of IP should be replaced in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add .... The New Ali@@ as dialog will be added .
enter the name of the known machine and click the Add button . if the known machine has several alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias name .
select an entry of a particular known machine from the list and select Edit .... The Modi@@ fied Calcul@@ ator dialog will be displayed .
it can be performed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will refres@@ h the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the network settings are not immediately effective in the system . to enable the changes , it must be set in a &amp; console ; the following command must be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is sufficient when &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed .
the installation of the ready @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with a graphical interface such as a package or the installation tool of your distribution .
in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de does not suff@@ ice ; in addition , the development packages with libraries and other libraries are needed .
this is recommended only by experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information is given on basic network technology , in the second section , all configuration files are discussed by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf .
this section cannot replace previous knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC in a small ( home ) network is convey@@ ed .
currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found widespread distribution . IP@@ v@@ 6 expects that it is going through in the near future . therefore , this description is currently focuss@@ ed on the common IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is the knowledge of which IP address is attri@@ but@@ able to a network interface . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; work@@ station , the network administrator is the contact person who has a valid IP address or , if available , DH@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address cannot be chosen arbit@@ rar@@ ily !
when setting up a small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a field reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwar@@ ded on the Internet , so any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gat@@ ew@@ ays .
for smaller networks , addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 168.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 168.@@ 1.@@ 254 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net .

&amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; is an application that allows you to run other programs after a timet@@ able in the background . it is a graphical interface for the &amp; UNIX system program cr@@ on .
when starting &amp; k@@ cr@@ on , see a list of already set tasks and related environment variables . if you use &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; as root , this will appear for all users of the system as well as for system @-@ internal tasks . each folder can be opened and opened .
in case of a de@@ activated task , program name and parameter are not displayed and the description will be de@@ activated .
the environment variables appearing here use the otherwise existing environment variables for all tasks listed here except power . in a de@@ activated variable , the description will be de@@ activated as a description .
to create a new task , first select the task folder . then go to Edit New .... Altern@@ atively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the task folder and select New ... or press C@@ trl ; N in the appearing context menu .
enter the name of the program to start . you can either specify a relative or absolute path name . if you want to search the program first , click Select ....
choose the minute ( s ) to which the task should be executed . with &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; you can specify the minutes in five steps .
when you specify both Mon@@ thly Meeting ( s ) and the day of the week , the task will be executed at a suitable date as well as on a suitable day of the week . for example , if you select the 1st and 15th and Sunday , the program will be executed on the 1st and 15th of the chosen month regardless of the week of the week , and also on every Sunday of the months , no matter what date they fall .
as with the creation of new tasks , changes will only become active when the cr@@ ont@@ ab is saved .
to cut a task , first select the task to remove . then go to edit cut out .
alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the task and select blan@@ ks , or press C@@ trl ; X .
to copy a task , first select the task to be copied . then go to Edit Cop@@ ying .
alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the task and select Copy , or press C@@ trl ; C .

it appears the default k@@ de ; printing dialog . if you choose fl@@ aps , you can see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options available in the printing dialog .
prints the cr@@ ont@@ ab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who own advanced auth@@ oriz@@ ations .
cr@@ on , for example , Vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the command cr@@ ont@@ ab to modify the sched@@ ules of the users .
a PO@@ SIX compliant &amp; UNIX , for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands of &amp; UNIX , to learn time and date .
&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it provides the ability to store multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar which also provided dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective packaging .
before a tape can be used it must be done by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; how@@ l back the tape and reads the clamp details of the tape . det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; when not on the tape , you will be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted .
det@@ ects &amp; dat ; the pre @-@ spell , search for the appropriate index on your disk . if this is not found , you will be asked if the index is to be recre@@ ated .
when everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was incorporated . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the volume of the belt can now be searched by fl@@ aps of the entry for the tape .
before throwing the belt , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; can be seen by changing the symbol for the tape , that the integration for the tape has been resolved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
before a tape of &amp; k@@ dat ; can be used it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a band type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this process does not correspond to format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; . if your tape drive needs to be format@@ ted before use , this must happen before you can format the tape from &amp; k@@ dat ; flo@@ ppy disk drives usually do not require a format@@ ting of the tape , DAT disks do not .
after entering the band name and the capacity , the band continues ; with the format@@ ting of the tape . all data on the tape is lost ! once the format@@ ting process is finished , the tape is automatically mounted and ready for use .
before you hit the backup process , you must select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only backup this file or folder .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are saved .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right click on the local file tree and select Save As ...
once the backup is started , the dialog opens for backup . in this dialog you can review the selected files and change the settings for backup .
the dialog displays the progress of the backup process including data rate and time remaining .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the record for the drive . only the selected file or folder is checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right click in one of the archives and select the menu entry Check ....
once the check@@ out process is started , the dialog will appear for review . in this dialog you can review your selection and change the working folder for review .
if you have confirmed the settings for verification , the dialog will appear over@@ checking . this dialog displays the progress of the exam and the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can re@@ produce the restore , the files that should be recovered must be selected . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the entry for the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be recovered .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select restore ...
once the recovery process has been started , the dialog for restoration will appear . in this dialog you can review your selection and change the working folder for recovery .
if you have confirmed the restore settings , the dialog will be restored . this dialog displays the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it is necessary to recre@@ ate the band index@@ ed file using the band content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of tape :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured will be updated automatically according to the chosen working folder .
for all folders listed under backup files , only the files located in the same file system are stored as the folder . folders that are located on other fil@@ es@@ ystems you can separate separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independently from the others .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is used . only the files that have changed since then .
the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
this del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before calling lin@@ tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snap@@ shot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; lt ; and lt ; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can be set up using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . the following settings can be done :
the full path to the device node for tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the belt device .
this setting is active , transmitted and k@@ dat ; before the tape em@@ beds the command mt load to the drive . in some drives this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed .
if the option is switched on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; lock the ej@@ ection during the tape drive . possibly , this setting does not work on all tape drives .
if the option is switched on , the tape is automatically ej@@ ected when rele@@ asing . do not use this option for flo@@ ppy streaming .
if the option is switched on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you must notify &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape format , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only show one memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are as follows :
( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is the machine name : seconds , where the name is the full name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the epoch in which the tape was format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HOME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives that can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup band . this symbol is only active if a tape is involved .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system protocols . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system supports the various protocol files . moreover , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access for example to information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system regi@@ sters the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log enables experienced users to quickly access information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore tries to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files of certain programs can be fil@@ tered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . this includes among other things :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Samba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the scre@@ enshot below , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions available with which the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can be easily fil@@ tered and sorted . the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start try &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - is not displayed , and it opens up instead of a small news window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very likely not started with system administrator rights . the protocol files are usually found in the directory / var / log , for the normal user usually no enti@@ t@@ lement to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criterion or the input string . the list of the log lines is now automatically changed so that only log messages are displayed that match the selected filter . then a log line will only display the entry All . then a log line will only be displayed when in one of the columns the string of the filter sear@@ ch@@ word is included .
you can of course select another entry at this point . for example , the string of the filter search term will only be compared to the entries in the column process , and in the filter bar , select the name of a process , so it shows you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all log lines that were sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of the level error are displayed with a more con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous color as a protocol @-@ lines of the level indication . the colored representation of protocol lines can be turned off in a setup dialog .
if you want to display only certain process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the sam@@ ba server start . in this case , use filter bar .
in addition , you can switch the option to new rows in the main window &apos;s context menu , in order to display all the new protocol lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ org D@@ ort you will find further up @-@ to @-@ date information on the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion repository : k@@ system@@ log ; im &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and also named in the following ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the system V In@@ it quickly became the standard for the control of program start @-@ up of the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . and indeed because it is easier to use , more powerful and more flexible than traditional BSD inclusion .
I will not go further into historical aspects ( because I know nothing about it : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone could attempt to make a machine on System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and reform@@ at@@ ting . the &amp; Linux ; kernel looks first under / etc after an in@@ it file . that &apos;s why you must make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are located directly in / etc . this folder is named r@@ c.@@ d. D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d includes a whole lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for any system service that you want to start at the startup of the system or when switching to another run level . system services do not include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , however , does not include such things such as set@@ serial , which is only launched once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also use r@@ c.@@ serial to / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port .
the kernel searches for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one to find .
the default run level is entered in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . in the starting area , you should see a line like the following :
at this point , you can take a look at the second column and probably notice that the default Run@@ level 3 is 3 . if you want to change this , then you can edit / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab manually and change the 3 . if you have brought something through , then you will repair it by re@@ boot the system and exec@@ uting the following :
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you will probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to any of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simply : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it is an argument as start and stop accepted . you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line as follows :
this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script is inv@@ oked with the argument stop . if it includes an S , the script will start with the argument start .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server run@@ level that can run only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . moreover , I could also have a user -@@ Run@@ level , das &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or other hand @-@ held device is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run levels to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or change the position within a level by drag@@ ging it somewhere else . thereby , the entry is removed from its original Run@@ level ( or its position ) . this only happens if they pull out an entry from the area of availability system services .
note : entries are moved if you drag them into a new area . to simply copy them to a new Run@@ level , you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste it into the destination area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the sor@@ ti@@ ern@@ um@@ bers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service .
note : currently there is no way to restore records that were thrown into the tr@@ ash . so be careful .
you can use the tab@@ ulator button to activate the different working areas ( available system services , run@@ level 1 start , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one .
to move an entry to another run level , move it with cutting to the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and insert it into the desired run level with inser@@ ting ( with C@@ trl ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or name of an entry manually , press the Enter key to switch the Properties dialog . use the Tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HOME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . def@@ aults are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DIR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they are recovered by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ ners , and now the machine is constantly breaking new . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single @-@ user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default run level to a reasonable value ( 3 should be normal ) .
I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution , please check if all configuration files are available that are required by the respective system service ( and also if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) are simply termin@@ ated without notice if their configuration files are not present or false .
the importance of the &amp; Linux ; run@@ way varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you are using a different distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that they can be added to this manual .
this documentation is based on &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter Adap@@ tation by &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after you have made changes , you need to save it . either use the corresponding icon of the toolbar or the Save in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two card cards , user and user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with double click on the entry . it appears the user or group properties dialog .
some card cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only if you have limited space restrictions ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card card will be created where you can configure individual settings . other cards appear if Shadow passwords are installed , for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd as in BSD installations .
the password management board appears if Shadow passwords are installed , for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ wd as in BSD installations .
this card card only appears if for at least a built @-@ in fil@@ esystem space restriction ( quot@@ a ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ zable at the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , with the restriction entries in KB are :
these parameters can be individually set for each fil@@ esystem . the current file system is selected with the help of the field file system with space restriction .
the tab group provides information about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the standard group to which the user belongs can be found in the Pri@@ mary Group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field .
the dialog properties of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button of the toolbar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group works analog .
with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot@@ Manager , add , remove and change the boot password , change the time to boot the standard operating system , remove the standard operating system , remove , modify operating systems , remove , modify and more .
