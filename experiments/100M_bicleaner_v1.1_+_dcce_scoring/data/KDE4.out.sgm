<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part in place of the entire URL; translated.</seg>
<seg id="3">Babelfish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, translations do not make important decisions on the translation without checking the translation.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only websites on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated on the Babelfish page itself, where you can insert translated texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">Package & package; contains various modules for & conqueror; in spite of their small size they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some functions of & konqueror; by making them easier available.</seg>
<seg id="6">Further information about the use of & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual to & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & conqueror, select Settings extensions... Open the tab tools and select the desired modules.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard Settings modules from the package kde; addons. please note that you may need more modules on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, the & konqueror; contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click in & konqueror; click on Tools Cancel. then you can view the page, the & konqueror; to crash, or the list of crashes if available.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module view filter (also known as the folder filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras View Filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in & conqueror, select Tools DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed website. as default, the display begins with the root node of the document, for example: documentazione, all other nodes are subelements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; displays a further view of objects with the MIME type inode / directory on local files. it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the content of your local filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="14">The feature of & FSView; is to represent nested folder hierarchies with the help of a so-called Tree map. tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of sizes of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView, the size is the size of a file or folder, with the size of a folder defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files, even then easily identified, can be easily identified when it is far down in the folder hierarchy. therefore, & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX command you can be considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView, an entry in the Treemap depiction is a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful color and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle that is switched over View Mode can be either depth for the easy detection of the nesting depth or the illustration of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the respective file or folder. for each feature you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough room to display or whether the area of subordinate rectangles occur. furthermore, you can set the relative position of the lettering in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">In case of representation algorithms for stemaps, the rule should be observed that the surface is proportional to the size of the entry. at the sitemap in & FSView; this goal is not always maintained. it will be drawn up to the nesting of the entries, and this framework needs space, which then gets lost to the subordinate entries, if the rectangle is quadratic.</seg>
<seg id="20">As splitting the area of an entry for the subordinate entries occurs, the implementation remains up to the implementation. in this case, it is necessary for the label and to avoid space losses through frame always advantageous the areas to arise that are as square as possible. the best methods in this are lines, columns or recursive branches.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can set the minimum represented area for an entry on the menu entry View on area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn in the surface of the higher-level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally was & FSView; conceived as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widget developed for the application of KCachingind.</seg>
<seg id="23">The picture gallery can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Tools Gallery... or by Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "when you access the" "" "View menu" "" "you will open a dialog with which you can set the image of the gallery." ""</seg>

<seg id="34">Using the comment file check box, you can specify a comment file for capturing the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">For the thumbnails, you can set a different color depth than in the original pictures for the thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; -Settings provides you with easy access to the general & HTML; settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; -Settings can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras HTML Settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to help you connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digikam. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library gphoto2. of course, any media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digikam; together.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digikam; provides fast image editing with basic image editing tools. you can use them to view, comment and correct your photos. editing capabilities can be easily extended with KDE Image Plugins Interface (Manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digicomes; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional skills. it works completely in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using libraw, DNG-export and ICC color management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, like & eg; via the camera or lens, via which can be searched.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs is also & digials; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of end users. you should therefore report problems and improvement options.</seg>
<seg id="60">This opens a dialog with a signed link. if you use these links, your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system. all the information you need is already registered. follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digikam; is a project supported by a community. that is, the users and developers can help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam, then we would like to ask you about other users of & digikam; ask and hopefully soon answer questions of other users.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digipate; homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about & digikam; to learn.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to join & digicame; to participate, registration is in the developer mailing list. instructions for logging in the developer mailing list of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you start & digies; for the first time, you'll be asked where to store your pictures and database. you can enter a local, remote or remote folder. simply enter the path name or click the folder icon folder to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data retrieval is stored. this path remains the same for all folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you would like to add. & digikam; will be used in addition as an Albenbibliothek. settings digies set up collections</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder containing pictures as the base folder. & digikam; looks at any subfolder as an album. no image will be changed. during browsing the folders you will see a progress gauge like this:</seg>
<seg id="68">& digikam; dures recursively the library path in its entire depth. you cannot exclude sub-folders unless it iste in hidden folder. this allows you to insert out-of-the-board and digial; do this by inserting a dot before the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenspiel don't have photos as symbols. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can set up in & digikam; set up your digital camera. afterwards, you should learn how to use My albums and My keyword box to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, you can handle it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu aid menu.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the Roh Decoder settings and raw workflow sequences.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to help you connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digikam. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library gphoto2. of course, any media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digikam; together.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera then appears as a disk drive. the camera then appears as a disk drive. the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digikam; uses the program gPhoto2 to communicate with digital cameras. gPhoto2 is a free, distributable software collection for digital cameras supporting a steadily increasing number of more than 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widespread protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need of additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and transmissions via the serial port are slow, this connection is now deprecated. & digikam; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found at this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support so that the thumbnails can be read reliably by a few libgphoto2 camera operators to read the preview images. if the Exif support is not present in libgphoto2, you may not be able to see thumbnails or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things in & digies; is how easy its functionality can be expanded through modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (Manual) is an approach to develop a common modular structure for & digikam; Photo Album, Showigs and Gwenview to develop. the goal is to provide the modules for all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way, as it can be a user. their advantage is that it is much simpler, and digies; by writing a small module to add a function as the changes in & digikam; even perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the sidebars with & LMB; remove or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Moving and laying images works everywhere: you can put an image in another part of the Albenedim, above the horizontal dividing line or in another application window. the only restriction is that a picture cannot be stored in keywords, date list or searches.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, raw, movies and audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for fields which are currently displayed in the symbol view. so the filter on the filename only works if this ind icon is also displayed. which fields are displayed you can configure in the dialog of the AlbenSettings.</seg>
<seg id="85">The View & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view of your photo albums. all photos stored by & digikam are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted according to the folders in which they were stored on the hard drive, by the name of their collection in the Albenches or by the date on which the album was initially created.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. select Album Imports images to scan. you can also add a screenshot to an album. select Album Import screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there. in the then appearing menu you will need to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all the photos and move it to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection. to access the album properties, you need to right click on the album and select Edit properties in the pop-up menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album- Collections: are a method to mark your albums, so that you can be grouped under a shared name. the collection used by you will be used to sort your photos by selecting the collection from the toolbar or view albums By collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do this in the Settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The Album- Date: will be used if you sort your albums by date with View albums By date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The buttons Ältesters, average, New Year: these set the date on the oldest, the newest picture or the average of the album. for this, first try to calculate the average of the pictures from their EXIF information. if this fails, instead, the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first entered an album in & digikam, the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; this is meant to help you remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo on the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album symbol, you need to click the image with the right mouse button and set it in the context menu. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digikam; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the field My keyword list at the bottom of the main window. album collections have a different effect. the collection includes always all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window provides you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all pictures will be displayed in this album in the image window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can customize the size of this preview with the two magnifying buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album for the first time, you have to wait short while the preview images are generated. you can avoid this using the Tools menu View all preview images.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information on each image will be displayed below the respective preview. what information these are, can be changed by setting the digitised settings. select the albums page here and adjust the area preview pictures to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The preview pictures have help windows that appear. the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo. the screenshot above in the section introduction to the main window shows such a help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">The image editing shows your photos and allows you to organize a number of improvements to it. you can select all the features associated with & digies; you can choose between viewing the images, slide show or editing the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by using either F4 image editing... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit... Select. in the section digikam, image editing you can see a tutorial on how to edit your photos. with the editing, you can view your photos and change them.</seg>
<seg id="102">It can happen that & digikam; the functionality you need is not provided. you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the submenu of opening. for this, and how to customize them to your needs, you will find information in the & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after processing through other image manipulation programs, problems with the metadata contained in the picture may occur. some programs do not store these data with when you save the changed image. this information is lost from EXIF- and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">The simplest is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select Dreams. in the submenu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the filename of a photo, you can right click the preview and select F2 renaming from the context menu. note that you keep the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc.).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you delete a photo from & digikam, it is moved to the trash of & kde; shifted. F8 image Delete or Del If you prefer to really delete, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">The View & quot; My Datumslistequot; organizes your photos by means of the data. & digikam; use either the EXIF date or if it is not available, the date of the last modification of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month are shown in the image view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view so that you can only show the photos of the selected days.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keywords provided a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalogue your photos. tags are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found again by selecting this keyword or search.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Keywords can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your keywords logical. you can also easily fold parts of the tree & quot; My keyword section; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for fast access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. you can also use your keywords in other programs. furthermore, the keywords in the loss of the database are re-imported as soon as & nbsp; the images notice.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by clicking the right mouse button either on & quot; My key word; or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword. if you have clicked on an existing keyword, this will become the substitchword of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and deleting. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by dragging it to the desired position in the tree and lay down there. then a menu appears giving you the possibility to move the keyword. a keyword can only be in the tree at a time.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by clicking with the right mouse button and edit the keywords in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My keyword;</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album symbol, you need to click the image with the right mouse button and select the album in the pop-up menu. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">This can be done in two ways: once you've picked up the photos you want to use with a keyword, you can click on the appropriate keyword in the tree & quot; My keyword; alternatively, you can click with the right mouse button on the preview of the pictures and select the keyword from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can add a photo with any number of keywords. the photo is displayed once you select one of the keywords assigned to it. in this way you can give a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was made, one for the event where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have a photo with keyword, this is displayed under the preview of the image in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and select Remove From the Tags menu. the menu will show you only the keywords assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view shows a time-dependent histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection frame can be moved through this histogram. to select a timeframe, you only need to click on the lower rectangle of the box, which indicates the time unit. this will display all the associated images in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below you can enter a title and save your selection. this then appears in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Include all elements of the database: names, reviews, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and in the future even more.</seg>
<seg id="125">In the search box, a small lamp is the green when the search is found. if you click here the filter will be deleted and all pictures will be shown again. if the search has not found anything, then the lamp is red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left sidebar with binoculars. if you open this, you get a simple search box as described above. you can save this search here but as a live search which always filters what you typed as search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are satisfied with your selection, press OK and the search will be performed. the results will be used in the My search list in the main window. if you want to change your selection after searching, you just need to select the corresponding item from the View My search list and select an option in its pop-up menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">If you select to edit search, the search dialog will appear again with the previously entered search information. if you choose to edit an advanced search, the dialog for Advanced Search will appear. you can find more information in the Advanced search section.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Delete in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">Advanced Search provides an advanced search form with many search parameters, with which you can search in certain fields of & digikam; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Albendatenbank. an option can be added to this list with search group / delete the search group. each option can be linked to others via the logical operations All..., One..., No... or At least... you can create searches of type & quot; AND NIGHT.</seg>
<seg id="132">& nbsp; characterizes every image by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures. the lower the difference between two picture signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area in which you can drop every picture to find a similar one. using a swellerts the result selection can be enlarged or resized. if you push a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the inaccurate search in the left sidebar, then it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: hand-hand sketches: draw a fast sketch and & digitally; find the matching pictures. also here a swelling value can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive search tool based on the Marble mini program. you can press the mouse wheel in or out, or hold it and move it. press Ctrl; left mouse button to pull up a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below you can specify a name for your geo filter. this will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a Live Geofolder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digikam; provides a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, even raw files, together.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L Dem Lighting table from the context menu. the selection will be added to the light table and open its window. if you are back in the main window, you can quickly open the light table with L Tools.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview bar you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right area of the window. a small arrow will show you which copy in which window area is to be seen. if you select to synchronize from the toolbar and perform the zoo or imposition operations on one of the pictures, then they will be compared with the other picture. you can therefore compare the same area of the two pictures.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly select from a picture series. if you are using pairing from the toolbar, then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas to compare. now use the left mouse button on any thumbnail to display it in the right pane.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal deletion actions also work directly from the light table like e.g. F4 file Edit....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right sidebar of the main window are available for both thumbnails in the light table. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">In the lower end of each area you will find a built-in swivel function that you can see on the crossed arrows. to rotate the visible area of the picture, you need to click it and hold the & LMB. in the mode preview, then both pictures will show the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zoom works as well as in other views. simply use the zoom knob under the images or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom in and out into the image. this happens in both pictures when you are in the Preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital asset management - away from the modeword? digital asset management considers every part of the process after the image has been taken up to the final output and permanent storage. each of the photos absorbs, scans or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory management. most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient manner.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to back up your pictures, find, protect and use your pictures. in doing so, we focus on the procedures for digital photographers the & digikam; use. we look at downloading, renaming, converting, converting, grouping, backing, optimising, waiting and exporting image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digitale population management takes on, indexed, categorized, secures, searches, transforms, ready and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is stored in accordance with your definition data that provides information on or a documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to claim that if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer then you need to find a certain photo without inventory management. if you do not even know how many photos you have, then do not use & digikam;. the approach metadata both in a database and in image files guarantees very fast searching and secure archiving for which you can freely access other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you do anything in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you must decide whether you want to save them to a reserved drive, or on a network drive & etc.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. vacation pictures can be easily found across your memory location unless you were in one year to organize several times in the same place. if you make enough photos, then you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export is then a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning of photos, archiving, work sequences, constant supply of pictures to different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years, 95% archives and 5% work files will have and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or an derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata option to be stored in the settings page of the metadata in & digikam; this ensures that EXIF and IPTC data are written to the file. if you forget it, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate point in the Album File menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change which? this includes & digies; them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts, since you should choose to assign keywords, labelling and valuation to each photo. of course, you can choose all the images that need the same attribute and set the value. this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos at work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's talk with keywords, keywords as you often call in other programs or continue categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keyword, then & digikam; automatically insert the tree for you or insert the images in the right place. changing the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by dragging a sub-tree to another.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graph shows how different metadata overcomes. this is a very rough representation, as each block of metadata is in truth from many sections. filenames and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to inscriptions or comments, the third important tool for cataloguing your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to let your photos simply be seen, you want to share them with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a beautiful beach view. if you look at it closer then catch some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you this of the Allied & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! you begin to dream, associations, memories, the historical period of time is present again, you may even hear the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who look at your photos the title might be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer, to help him about the motive you are moving has to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength to work only with a label for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digikam, you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as labeling. if you export your images to web galleries, then these labels will be exported to your liking and / or the title of the web gallery system.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find a different city without navigation system? was it Earth not a boring planet from GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now starts with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to exploit the geolocation are countless and become deeper into the future. I am sure one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your journeys using pictures with geographic information. & digikam; can also export kml files that can be opened with GoogleEarth. you can also export the images to Gallery2, picasaweb, Flickr & etc.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a pun with copyright and describes practice the copyrights to use to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information in the setting page of & digikam; as information should be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should include your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to use the photographer's name, e.g. to protect the photographer's identity, then the name of a company or organization can be used.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title: associated with the author. this field contains the work name of the photographer. examples of this can be titles like: employed photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. as this is a note to the author's field, this must be completed as well.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for vendors): use the provider field to identify who the photo offers. this does not necessarily have to be the author. if the photographer is for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here that you provide the picture to others. if the picture is a stock photo, then here the group / agency that offers the picture is given here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, even though they do not provide protection against misuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calculator can delete or modify them. the solution for this problem is digital watermarks. for private persons this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and half professionals this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique for each image. in the near future, it will provide such a module for batch processing.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: record error, disk failure, electric shocks, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, desasterwork, lifetime, temperature, data size, widespread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on a fire. these kinds of losses are the same which can happen to you in traditional paper pictures or negatives. in this section we are dealing with problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTrack, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics which causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, these must be handled careful and you can't trust you for more than a few years. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are more difficult to get and much more expensive. there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & dollars; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors, even if you were just written. therefore, use a control mechanism to protect yourself. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control sums. despite this massive protection, they are aging through chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there is a convenient program called IsoBuster that causes miracle in CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux; but is not available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks, hard disks, flash media, USB drives etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical Media: Blu-ray Disks seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD. a dual layer Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost sixsmal the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB. everything that has been said about CDs and DVDs is of course also valid for the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Slowly burn with a good record on high-quality media in a non-propriate format. also, you should read the media with a description, date and author and then store it on a clean, dark dry and protected site. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Floppy manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves. their manufacturers' warranties include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard disks on this subject: Dismiserstudie</seg>
<seg id="187">In brief: disks hold the longest if you are operated in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. at lower temperature range, the error rate increases dramatically. electronic parts of the controller are the most common error cause, SMART cannot detect these errors. some of SMART errors indicate the imminent failure.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files, but these losses can normally be restored without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices account not much, it looks different for devices with computer chips and high-speed processes. these can cause severe damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause severe keyboards, complete data loss, hardware aging, damaged motherboards and other defects. protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against current peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs part of the energy source and yields the rest. it is normally available in the form of a connector bar. however, remember that not every connector bar also contains overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, you should take care that it meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also take care that it offers protection against lightning strike and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">As an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should be careful that even all peripheral devices connected to your system are also protected. some manufacturers provide overvoltage shooter that also includes a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of cable modems and television.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a laptop, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are designed specifically for notebooks and are therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection protects your system from smaller fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you in a complete outage. even an emergency of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in a break-free power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to the protection against overvoltages, these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power outage occurs. this gives you the possibility to save your data and run down the system. if you buy a USV then you should be sure that they are fulfilling the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. in addition, the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and and compare its safety in case of electricity disruptions with the cost to avoid this. a high quality overvoltage protection can cost you up to & euro; 20. this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can install it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">However, they are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollars; 500. in addition, you must send the data over the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a general securing solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services available on photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the perspective of data backup, the web solutions are very secure. data transmission errors are automatically cleared thanks to the TCP protocol, and with the large companies it contains a backup and a distributed memory.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer. all transfers are vulnerable to transmission errors. the ZFS and btrfs file system ensures at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred, not if this happened in your hardware. all of these disturbances remain undiscovered until you were destroyed one day. no one seems to have thought of it. no one seems to have thought of it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of data loss, since they generate interactions within the data streams. in normal filesystems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of bugs per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">It is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it is soon available for & Linux; and Windows is available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">This is still in alpha state. it uses the same protective mechanisms used by ZFS and is also available for & Linux; however, it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss in the notebook and 46% of the workstation systems. at Notebooks, the proportion of theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to a lower damage, such as theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; has been no longer sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source filesystems are less vulnerable to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the common file systems. you can find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the examination process during a sudden disruption during surgery is higher and an undefined status will be avoided. however, if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors from digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings removed from fundamental physical borders. this means that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all kinds of light sensors are not far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras operate in the direction of 10 megapixels. even though this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result, the optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have their limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions, you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard drive will get you today for 100 & euro; so do not make anyone responsible for data loss. so protect your data according to a plan and test this backup before you make anything dangerous like reinstalling your operating system, replacement of disks or resizing disks.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your fuses on an external SATA drive daily. if, then one day, a lightning strikes you luck if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget airborne disaster: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous for your data. they normally concern an entire room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, disaster prevention is always a non-local storage. bring your backups up the stairs to the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above is a frequent reason for data loss despite backing up the panic. if you have a backup which is not available immediately, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a full snapshot at two time points: the complete backup and the last differential lock.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. generates multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time on which such backup has been made. this backup comes to a versioning system closest to the exception that is only getaway and not continuous.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only copies the difference of files that have been really changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important images directly after saving them on your computer to a DVD or other optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure allows you enough time to discover and restore losses. at the same time you come for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. in the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata in the image file stored IPTC information, associated XMP files, original retained, memory, scalability, media, reviewing images and metadata, copying images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewing devices,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that is about the period of time you really are interested in because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re-evaluate during the time. unfortunately, there is no other way of making a certain vigilance. however, every 5-8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backward compatible. the less variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the issues of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by declarations in this document. use or switch to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone nowadays. so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, storage and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the technical expression for the ability to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have planned scalability with and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. for * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and shift it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg whether your new disk is detected by the system, but do not hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollars; dd if = / dev / sdc / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc, the new record is / dev / sdc & dollar; Parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the disk in MBit; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32, and reiserfs & dollars; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # alter the size of travel if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day does not exist any more software to read, then you can create it yourself. this task will be easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. you should therefore no longer use it.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been designed as an open source standard of GIF, but it can store much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per colour channel and full transparency. PNG can store gamma- and chromaticity data for improved color assignments on heterogeneous platforms.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with lossless compression algorithm (DEFLATE). it manages images in high quality, but requires very large files. with some cameras, you can save your images in this format. however, there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative File Format is a licensed and open source format that has been developed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been developed based on the TIFF / EP format and obligated to use metadata. a handful camera manufacturer makes DNG now available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will also use it sometime.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Bildresource blockquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a label technology that allows users to embed their data into a file itself. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive the original of your photo, mostly in the raw format. however, XMP adapts as it stores metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems when linking the metadata files and the image file, and as mentioned above, the raw format will be used. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything there.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a large range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include the work on architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI workgroups, annual conferences and workshops, standard links and educational efforts to achieve a broad acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the pictures are on the camera editing, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save it in your shell archive. this feature is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For fine-layered editing, you can use external programs. if you edit the images again with & digies; edit, then you should add the metadata once more. they may be cut off from the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the edited pictures for copyright with a digital watermark. only export them into web galleries, encode in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digikam; to add a photo to an album you will find a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for importing images to your Albendatenbank.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digicame; connect it to the computer, turn the camera to the display mode and turn it off. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">If you start the camera interface, it tries to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a skill indicator appears at the bottom end and the preview pictures of all photos on the camera are displayed. some cameras do not display thumbnails. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for file association settings for each file, photos, movies, music etc. are displayed on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before downloading the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the page bars properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and photo information that are stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer yet. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The Metadata tab displays the internal metadata such as Exif, manufacturer's notice, GPS, etc. of the image. this information is the same as the metadata header from the main window of & digikam; or image editing. note that these metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on their computer is the click on the button Download and then download the selection of all. this loads all photos from their camera into one album in & digikam;. when downloading, the photos are not deleted and we recommend to check if the pictures were safely downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all photos, you can only select the desired one with the default selection methods of & kde; select the download button and then download the selected. the selected button will be downloaded as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New is available. these images have not yet been downloaded from & digikam; downloaded. in this case, the new images are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, of course only the new pictures are downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">The list of existing albums is displayed in the My albums section. the list of existing albums is displayed in the My albums section. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After selecting the target album, press OK, and & nbsp; loads the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all at once by removing the Delete All. if you want to delete only a few, you will need to select it first and then delete the selected delete.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no way to restore photos that you have deleted from the camera. so you should carefully check if the photos were successfully deleted in a & digishot; album downloaded before you delete them from the camera. if you want to completely erase the camera, you should do this via the camera, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as filenames for the photos often not particularly meaningful names. the filenames are usually recycled after the photos are deleted from the camera. this can lead to duplicate filenames if you upload photos of different recording studios to the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time in which the picture was taken to integrate into the filenames.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for date-based captions. if you use this latter option, you will automatically create a folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options While the commit opens three more options that are executed before the photos are stored on the disk. the first two affect the data about the author in the section Standard Autonomty. if you select this, the corresponding entries are copied from the Exif information into the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date and time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you wish to use a different date format than the standard format, you can use the prefix photo% Y-%% d% H% H:% M:% S. switch on the option date & time. for further customization, you should read the help of the command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera filenames, you have the option to change the file names in lowercase letters. or in uppercase if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, the & digikam; used for a photo, is shown below the name that the camera provides in the preview. your settings for renaming will be saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& nbsp; can use all the information on the orientation of the camera to the time point of recording to perform an automatic spin during shutdown. not all cameras provide this information. in the section Page Metadata, you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">Automatic rotation is normally turned on, and if your camera does not supply this information, lets & digies; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off automatic turning, use the Advanced button and select the automatic turn in the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available, it can create scanned images in the target album. all images with the same date are loaded into the same album. not all cameras provide this information. in the section Meta data you can read which information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally off, and in this case it stores & digies; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to disable this option. use the Advanced Folder option and select the date-based underage option at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to download photos from your computer to their camera is the download button. select Upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, asks & digikam; you where the images should be uploaded. a folder selection dialog for the camera appears. select the folder you want and press OK to start uploading. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this refers to a position indicated in length and width grads and which can be displayed on a map. determining the data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers, it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to map an area through automatic recording of GPS data. environment planners, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this capability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have later forgotten where exactly the photo was made, you can open a browser that displays the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digishot; users wanting to locate the location of the photo, or just want to document this aspect, it is well to store the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields such as direction, saddle and map references. so the question is actually more about how the data comes into these fields? there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the correct hardware, via post-processing of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographical mapping (manual) and last about manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few who work with GPS receivers. either as card module or by transferring the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS Interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading of GPS data from one device can be done with gpsone or gpsbabel. however, you must store these data in gpx format as this is the only format supported by the module to the geographic mapping.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract and correlate the data of images and from the GPS. on the following page you can make the same as & Linux; make: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitudes or other data, then you can use this script that works with the ExiTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the characters provided by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show European road maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">The setting dialog is divided into eight pages. the settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be set to set-up preview or start editing. you set the default behavior of & digikam; set when you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically written to the corresponding IPTC data fields when the option is selected when downloading from the camera interfaces.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for fascia: this field should be the professional name of the photographer. this can be labels such as employed photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. as this is a more detailed description of the author, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for vendors: use this field to give the photo. this does not have to be the author if this is a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organisations should be registered here as this is the picture to others & quot; offerenquot;. if the image is a stock photo, then the group or agency that provides the image will be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the corresponding IPTC field. this ensures that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of & digikam;. these metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported in & digikam; imported without lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save image captions as embedded lettering (JFIF) in JPEG pictures: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the labels embedded in the pictures. this allows you to read your captions from other image viewers.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse cursor is in the main window above a file. depending on the chosen option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digicame; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digials; to display, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list. any file in a & digikam; album folder that has none of these extensions, von & digikam; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by pressing the button Update on the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">Some images have different sizes and the synchronous mode is then not available. some images have different sizes and the synchronous mode is then not available. the option & quot; In the whole image size ladenquot; you should only use on fast calculators. if you have one, then you can hereby obtain better view results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, the image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select them here. you can turn off the toolbar if you use the image editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or light color in the picture. these colors are set here. in the image processing, this view mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">Chroma-subsampling is meant that images are encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in color information. please refer to this article in Wikipedia for the closer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the setting png compression, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce image quality as PNG requires a lossless algorithm. the only effect is that the image data requires more time for extracting and unpacking. if you have a fast machine, you can set this value to a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option TIFF files compress you can switch the DEFLATE compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of TIFF images. it does not affect the image quality as the DEFLATE algorithm works loss-free.</seg>
<seg id="299">When you select loss-free JPEG-2000 files, you can save loss-free. even if you select the loss-related setting, the ratio between quality loss and file size is much better than normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata was not yet supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digikam, image editing was just an image viewer for photos. at present, it is very fast becoming a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard acceptance is that all green pixels are equal. if the straight-line green pixels of the CCD sensor react to sensitive to ultraviolet light, this difference creates a grid pattern in output. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimal loss of details. this option marks the image a bit soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if the white balance is not set. standard it is a solid color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images get more details in the top lights in four steps. for other cameras, this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is it the top lights, so the parts of your images are the burned-in, because of the inability of your camera to capture the top lights as a continuous white. use the setting continuous white in the settings. the setting colours dissolve some unusual results, since they display the top lights in various rosaries. lastly, you can try to reconstruct some parts of missing information from the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red. & nbsp; and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions out of the still unsaturated blue pixels. of course this is a question how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option to reconstruct the option, you get the option to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and can / should be adjusted individually for each picture.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value to your taste. you probably need to set it slightly higher than the standard 1. however, this can also be done later in the image options of the & digikam; image editing. to keep the time for the Demosaicing small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the sub-rohdata, which have many cameras and which provides a matrix of color pixel. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color structure.</seg>
<seg id="310">And Dcraw gives you three alternatives: bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD interpolation. after some tests it looks like this. VNG interpolation (variable number of gradient) was the first algorithm that was used by Dcraw.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses, you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for color correction, since it is done during the raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions like this should be returned. there is also LCMS and & digikam; information such as color information from one color space to translate to the other so that the colors are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions when an image is opened in the Image Processing / Image management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile folder View the folder, such as / usr / share / color / icc or / home / user / .color / icc, in which you save all your profiles.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles you have here the possibility & quot; standard squot; for your profiles to be deposited. everything can be changed when opening the raw file.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here only your pictures are color-managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">Not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which do not contain colortone mapping or gamma correction. currently, dcraw Gamma does not corrects for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you must perform the mapping of the mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options such as the Soft Proof profile, with which you can emulate how your image would be returned from one device. this is very useful before you print a picture since your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore can work very saturated. this could be manually corrected, rather than rely on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is pretty obvious which colour profile is intended for what it is intended for. unfortunately not in the models of Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is of course inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension leaves the style for the goal: F for an exact style, L for landscapes, N for neutral, P for portrait and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image plugin interface. it is an interface that is supported by a number of & kde; image viewer and image editing. by deploying this interface & digicomes; many modules support, which were written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the modules you want to use, and they are then loaded by & digikam; load these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Shortcuts.</seg>
<seg id="324">For more information (in English) via KIPI modules, you can get through the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusts the time between the picture transitions, usually 4-5 seconds. the other cross-fields turn the metadata on or off, which are displayed at the bottom of the pictures during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera properties show a list of all the currently supported cameras on the left. on the right top there is a button automatic detection that attempts to identify a camera connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure that the camera is properly connected, switched on and in the image display mode. among these are the port settings. currently, serial, USB and USB / FireWire mass storage is supported.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom you can set the path for USB- and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you have selected a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list. you need to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / Removable, on which you mount your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digies; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, put it in the display mode and turn it on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check out if & digikam; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera model and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this is displayed in the main window's cameras. if you own more than one camera, you can insert all of them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option confirmation dialog for moving &gt; pictures to the trashcan, you can set the conversation of & digikam; setting a photo in an album. in the deletion of a photos and deletion of an album you will find more details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right sidebar can be tacitly controlled by & digikam; apply if you use the option changes in the right sidebar without any queries. otherwise, you have to save changes with the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also disable the welcome screen of & digikam; disable it when starting. this accelerates the starting process of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="334">The setting to search for new photos forcing & digies; to search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos. this extends the starting time of & digikam;. if something from the base folder has been deleted, asks & digikam; you, if it is to delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be in & digikam; used to customize the main window to your taste. these settings can be selected in Settings Design from the toolbar. a preview of the available designs will be listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in plain text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digikam, you will find more information about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">You can use this to view your photos and to edit and improve. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of previewing and selecting the entry Display / Edit.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image editing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digikam; so you may not be part of your distribution. for more information on the KIPI modules, see the Image Processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window, the filename, current file number, enlargement factor and the current image size indicates.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently needed functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of the editing process change your photos. none of the functions will change the original photo before using File Save or button Save from the toolbar. note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should possibly make a copy of your image before changing it. you can save it using file Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the File Recovery menu or the button The button reproduce reproduce in the toolbar. you then lose any change you've done at the photo since the last saving.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually any action of image editing can be reversed or restored. the last action can be reversed by selecting or restoring reproductions from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should use the shortcut keys, Ctrl; -Z to undo and Ctrl; -Shift-Z to reproduce.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; press the Reproduction or restore button in the toolbar for a moment longer, you will receive a pop-up menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions will also be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, picture down or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes in the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save it.</seg>
<seg id="348">In the photo you can zoom in and out in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select a magnifying factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View full screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode. you come to the normal view in which you use the Esc key. normally, you can change this in the settings dialog by & digikam; change it. you can view it from the & digikam; main window. see the section for setting up image editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can select the image from the File menu and get the default & kde; print dialog. you can customize the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print single images or whole sets. whole picture preview pages can be printed from your selection. you just need to select the pictures with the standard methods and select from the menu album Export printer wizard. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The main window has a side bar at the right edge providing important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is available without the navigation arrows, even in image editing. it will display when one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicks on the same tab lets the sidebar appear or disappear again.</seg>
<seg id="355">The text is UTF-8 compatible. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the labelling is copied to the EXIF- and IPTC fields so that you can use other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are converted. if you want to use the IPTC label field in other applications, you should note these limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented on it, use either the Applicator button or simply switch to the next image, the labeling will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the Apply button, there is a button More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also write the metadata to the files. however, this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written into the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The appraisal section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate several images at the same time, select it and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the IPTC field. the encoding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view displays a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree and a selection box with previously used keyword keywords.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adjusted to the entered search word. you can limit the number of possibilities in search of a keyword quickly. this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is another relief when entering keywords in a picture series. if you have entered different keywords, they are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by marking the appropriate cross-fields in the tree. all keywords of a picture are stored in the keyword IPTC field.</seg>
<seg id="365">If you select multiple images in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree, this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not on the entire selection, if you want to provide a keyword, please refer to the keyword section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The side bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of images shown in the main window. normally, the left side bar is used with their album, date, keyword and search views. if one or more keyword filters are used from the right side, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all erect keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">If the keyword already exists, you can simply pull it out of the right sidebar and put it on the selection. then a dialog appears asking you if you want to put the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the images on a calendar tag. the keyword filter is on no keywords, which reduced the amount to three images. you have been selected with Ctrl + a and then a keyword from the right keyword tree has been selected and stored there. a dialog asks if this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at every start of the program. it can also be switched off under Settings Miscellaneous.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and find that it should be one or more, you can easily change this by double-clicking on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry after which is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or string, which is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">You can, for example, set an Advanced search on all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you just need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button grouping. the options then look like this:</seg>

<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was chiefly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why one uses a color-managed workflow is that the colors that have actually been photographed or scanned from your camera or scanner. with a color-managed workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are identical to those of your camera or scanner and the colours you print or publish in the web from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the topic comes to color administration, everyone wants to know which buttons it needs to press for the results it wants. unfortunately, color administration means that you make informed decisions at any point in the image processing workflows. the sense of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color administration. in addition, links with deeper information allow you to make your own informed decisions to make you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about colour management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image issues are by email or web, where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life easier for everyone, why should one use another colour gamut to think about colour management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB in comparison to the colors we can see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all the colours we can see, the hugely shaped region, and the colours in the sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindblooms excellent page and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I need to calmer my monitor if I chose to work only in sRGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in the sRGB colour space or not, you need to calmer your monitor, since sRGB indicates that your; onitor closes the circle. if you work as in the color space of sRGB, you either need to calliar your monitor to the sRGB-standard, use a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting a further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalize, Compare, Automatic setting and contrast extend from the Correct Automatic correction automatically try to make the best from your colors. you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scale the luminous values over the entire image so that the darkest point is black and the brightest spot as bright as possible without changing its shade. this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">Same: this method adjusts the brightness factor of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible. sometimes the same has very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only garbage. it is a very powerful operation, which causes either miracles in an image or it destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic balance: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright limit tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram area.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the widest possible range and a new jib of all values in between. this is only visible in balanced pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is somewhat limited with a color space with 8-bit per colour. so if you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can perform the white balance in the blank mode, which works in 16-bit mode, so your possibilities for correction will fail.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm of the copyrighted by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it via the menu entry colors white balance of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side both the original image and the preview of the target picture can be seen. the preview is dynamically adjusted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance, then it is enough to click on the thumbnail.</seg>
<seg id="398">Thumbnail preview features a red marker. the Luminancy of the pixel below this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">To the right, a histogram shows that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lighted images, most pixels have very small luminance values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment lets you improve the shading details of your photos or also dim down.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. in this way the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of presets. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The oversupply indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. They will get the combined result displayed in the white balance. this is displayed in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons save as and load exactly this. each setting of the white balance that you have set can save you with this in a text file and then load it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button sets all filter values back to their default values and their neutral white balance. note that also neutral settings will result in another photo than your original. if you save them your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image. 8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better for high-quality images. however, this encoding also requires more disk space, calculation time and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. colour mapping can be carried out by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed guidance on how to use color profiles allows you to consult the chapter color administration.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is to find color correction in the menu. this tool provides an integrated path to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously and allow you to use your settings so that you can use them for several photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner will always need the same corrections.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure sheets is the tool for gradation that you can find under color gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">Das & digikam; die Farbeffekte presents you four color effects, a solar process effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, solar-ization, also called Sabatier, was an effect that emerged if you switched off a partially developed pressure a short flash light and afterwards completed the development of the image. this had the effect that the brighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar energy. at about 50% intensity the picture shows what is chemically possible. a further increase creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photopaper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar process effect. the original image is the (1) and that processes the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simple, it embellifies many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted color film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and therewith a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make it a film of choice for nature photographers. Velvias strongly saturated colors are also some photographers, especially those that clear no landscapes, too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neonfilter simulates Neonlight on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neon light. in large images, the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and the luminosity of the photos. you can for experimenting the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your alignment can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result you use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">When you make a photo in poor lighting conditions, you can get the reverse issue: a too large saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation instead of increasing it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous thickness / contrast / gamma is the tool tuning correction based on the improvement of the exposure. even if the dialog for this tool works very complicated, you need only the range of sliders for the purposes described here. concrete the three sliders below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph, three sliders can be clicked into and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to move the knob and take care of how the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right side, the original and preview of the picture can be seen. the preview will be updated dynamically, based on the settings of the picture. on the left side, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box it is possible to set whether the histogram is represented with a linear or logarithmic Y-axis. for images of a digital camera, the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case the logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knobs: the uppermost for the dark notes, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle sounds, often called gamma values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three colour pinettes can be used in preview the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows, middle and light tones. in addition, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controls that can be used to interactively modify the output values as in the input values.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatic: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and Load: with these buttons, the set values can be stored in the filesystem and loaded later. to do this, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pettes, the input values are automatically readjusted for all shadows, medium and sun tones. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The oversupply indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only displayed in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">The left side shows half of the original and the target image. the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings. the following options are available on the right-hand side:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifier channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel that is changed by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box, there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for images recorded with a digital camera is mostly the linear mode of the most useful. for images with large areas of a constant color, the linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case logarithmic mode continues.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you shift a curve part to the right, for example the bright tones, you can see that these bright tones correspond to darker output tones and darker to darker the corresponding pixels.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red marking to see. if you want to change this selection to the area you want to change, a matching line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and Download: with these buttons, you can do this exactly. each curve that you have created can be saved in the filesystem and loaded later. the file format for this is Gimp cornering format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you create this method and the three color pipettes automatically the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and sun tones. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the original picture to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The oversupply indicator control controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels, you will see the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only displayed in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and sun tones have been set with the color pipette and applied to curves. the original picture is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of the & digies; image editing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photo.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the colors of the images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel blender of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first hint how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left area of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed as a comparison of your own tab.</seg>
<seg id="444">Viewing the target image features a red marker. if you position it in the image, a vertical line will appear in the histogram to display the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls for the module are right down: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you activate Luminance, the picture will retain the general brightness, even if you activate the appropriate color component. this is especially handy if you also enable the option Monochrome, since the channel mixer is then THE tool to generate great black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix Monochrome, the reduction of a color will result in a visible noise coming from the colour space. color brauschen consists of small noise artefacts that do not appear in the same place in the color channel and their sound pattern in each channel looks different. if that is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the color space first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save as and Shop buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any blender setting can be saved for later and then load. the file format used is the Gimp channel blender format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The oversupply indicator controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only displayed in the preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been readjusted. the option Luminancy Store is enabled. the original image is under (1) and the edited image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step, as color images can be easily converted on the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white file sighting with a green lens filter. this looks great, with all scene pictures and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange-filter: simulates a black / white filming with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange-filter.</seg>
<seg id="454">RotFilter: simulates a black / white file sighting with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate lunar phases during the day time. so similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white filming with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow gel filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: produces warm light and middle tones as it adds a bit of cold into the shade. this is very similar to the process of a print and redevelopment in a sepia oner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Using the & digicomes; apply tool texture you can apply decorative textures to an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can let it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: move this parameter to the right further increases the appearance of the depth or the three-dimensionality of the texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been applied on the photo below. the original image is (1) and the changed under (2). the parameter relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">Using the & digicomes; add tools frames can be added a decorative frame around an image.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. one possibility to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier to the scattering eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image. the picture with a coloured line, Niepce stranded it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), shkantet surround it with a nice three-dimensional frame which is ideal for a buttonfire effect and decorative insert a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: indicates the width of the frame in percentage. the range of value for the width is from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image decorated with the frame will be bigger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important to print the pictures, especially if you have used the tool to cut the aspect ratio before.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can insert simple a formatted text in an image at any position. this also works in several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply insert the text and place it with the mouse. use text direction, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it. you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button "OK." once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it cannot be changed anymore.</seg>
<seg id="469">"" "using the" "" "edit" "" "tool, you can apply a template to a template." ""</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image template can be used in image editing can be used to put templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template, there are no limitations regarding size and orientation. however, you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) to shrink the file size of the template. if you want to add your template of the & digikam; stencil database, simply send an e-mail in English to the & digikam; mailinglist digikam-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your stencil folder with the base folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you have copied the stencil files. these settings are marked for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the templates, a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the stencil folder. the selection of a folder automatically updates the templates preview toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below you will find three buttons with which you can change the magnifying factor and position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button increases the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Smaller: this button resizes the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you need to resize the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below. to do this, take the picture and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be automatically adjusted to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digikam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but produced especially in dark areas, grainy pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blur mask works at the contrast of the edges to let a picture look sharper. actually, it doesn't sharpen it a bit, it works more psycho-visual. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunst and it makes here a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitised images need correction of sharpness. this is because the digitization process needs to summarize colors with minimal differences to a color point. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally require more consequential sharpness than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">With JPEG images a camera is often used for internal sharpness. images in the raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a focal depth during reading the image. if you disable it, you will get control over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo using the sharpness tool. you can use the menu entry Corrigate sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should be careful with this because the results do not work very naturally: the sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but amplifies the noise. generally, the most useful technique for sharpening an image is refocusing. you can refocus it via the menu entry Corrigate. under refocus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the image a bit soft is much easier than to sharpen. use the tool to soften softwood with the menu entry Corrigate softeners and experiment with some settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog will show you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter is blurred masking is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. you can see a demonstration here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview help to edit the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should be tried first. an increase of the radius or the amount increase the effect. if you make the blur mask too strong, smokers and the impression of grates are produced near sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius shows how many pixels on each side of a channel are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. you should therefore sharpen images best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wiped image which is added to the original. this will set the strength of the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference in difference. thus, one can thereby define a minimum difference thus for a channeling of the filters. in this way, areas with a soft switching between the tones are excluded and hence beauty errors in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unsharp masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited picture the (2). blurred masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">Das & digikam; tool redireeren refocusses an image by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted depletion filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese filtration. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blur mask. refocus usually reaches better results than blurred. you can start it from the menu by refocusing colors in image editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folding is much better than the Gauß's attitude. the Gauß's folding has a very long tail, which leads to this the mathematical result also depends on the source pixies that are far from the original square pixel. in most cases, the FIR Wiener Inverse der Gauß's folding is even very strongly affected by the remote pixels. it causes unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular focal point: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should result in 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image should be very blurred but then pay attention to halo.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in the correlation can help reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0,99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filters: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad. an useful value is 0.03.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß's edge: this is the radius for the Gauß's sharpness. use this parameter if your blur is Gauß. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a value unequal to zero, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix Size: this value determines the size of the matrix. an increase in the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular focus or the gauge 'sharpness. note however that the module will be very slow when you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and Loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocussed parameters you have set will be stored for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to do all the trimming, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before changing the image. the reason for this is that many operations changes that are not immediately visible, but which leave uncomfortable artifacts later.</seg>
<seg id="507">When you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, blurred masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by blurred masking a larger neighborhood used than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, blurred masking must always create artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blurring. in practice, the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blur mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better in processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color image has to be corrected. this image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the field of field error correction, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator smoothness sets the sharpness of the area of the darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink tinting allows a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can set this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove not desired artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS lab in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings fine, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail conservation p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to an even smoothness over the picture. weighed higher values mainly smooth regions and let details be sharp. a value of 0,9 should obtain details so that no sharpening should be subsequently required.</seg>
<seg id="520">Directional dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value close to 1 is smoothed in one direction. if you have a film body or CCD noise, a high value will produce shaft-like patterns. JPEG artifacts are best removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor via alles. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value appropriate to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary when a lot of noise is occurring, because it is then difficult to appreciate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is going through. normally, here is 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle-graduation da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is choosen small, it should also be selected small. therefore, make sure that small angles make a long runtime. therefore, you should choose this value as greatest possible and acceptable to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrated step-width [0,1, 10]: integrated step-width in pixels. you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never greater than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Using linear interpolation: the more quality you get by selecting this option is only slight. it doubles however the runtime. we recommend it to allow it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons save as and load exactly this. each setting of image error corrections can be saved to a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors are corrected with little artefacts. the module is used on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you see, there is a peculiar black artefact in the foreground that caused by a bad film storage during the trip. the original image is below (1) to see and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digikam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts which occur e.g. from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information on sensor noise from digital cameras, you can check it in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grainy noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the details pane and the Advanced Settings window can remain in default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius checks the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time required for the filter per pixel and can blur the image. the area indicated by the radius is smoothed over the image and the color in it is smoothed and therefore smaller errors.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness of the pixel. this value sets the pixel pitch that the filter looks forward to ascertain light density changes. if it is increased, noise peaks are reset. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter picture details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubrication will resume.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, not the entire noise can be removed or diamond spikes can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG image file without losing any details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend either changing color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either changing color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamma-tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically more screwed up.</seg>
<seg id="541">Attenuation: controls the adjustment of the phase jitterabsorption. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of the luminance. when it is increased, the edges appear smoother when it is too high, noise and phase jitter appear at the edges. it can remove rough peaks and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are used exactly for this. all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be saved to the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction has been applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. fortunately, the solution to draw the image a bit soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use this tool to soften softwood with the menu entry Corrigate softeners and experiment with the smoothness. the preview window on the right side of the dialog displays the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digikam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your images. it is very well adapted to remove taste, movie grading, scratches, compression artefacts and local errors that appear in digital, original or subsequently digitalized images. the smoothing takes place along the image contours and thus preserves the content as it does the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and texture mapping. the texture mapping is performed using another tool, the image error correction. the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS lab in Caen / Frannecy and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts Reduce: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a low-loss compression algorithm, it generates some compression & quot; Artefaktequot; - small standards that can be seen in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">Each setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="551">The module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Minolta (tm) 700si camera on a Ilford (tm) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film-grading on the faces. the original image is under (1) and the corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of photo restoration. this time textures were applied to an old color photo that was read with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts caused by the scanner illumination and the photo paper. the original image is shown below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The Hotpixels tool allows hotpixels of photos to be removed with a CCD camera, eight have been removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are copyrighted by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high-quality raw-mode photos because many cameras with JPEG compression feature a built-in repression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot Pixelquot; and "quot; bright pixel quot; on a photo with a dark image subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file into the wizard with the Dark image button. the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important to record the dark image directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixel by CCD Defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the right darkpicture to the image to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixel. note that the wizard will remember the last dark image and automatically recharges it in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview help you to correct the result within the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are highlighted in all preview areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">The result is an average of the neighbour pixels. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line for a 1-dimensional interpolation.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square finish (2-dim) or a group of square bends (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, applied from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">Die & digikam; Vignetting Correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, especially the medium and large photo format, can often not illuminate the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignetting enquot; (shaded) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephots may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">Many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which allows the necessary shutter speed to keep the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also use center filters, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, since otherwise unsharpening effects are caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure ranges of today's film and gradation of digital cameras and film scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a centerfilter by applying an equivalent transformation to a raw image that was made without this filter. the tool Vignetting Correction is turning the transformation with a centric filter on a picture. the algorithm is copyrighted by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulators you can control the Vignetting Correction Filter and with three further exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light-strength attenuation at the point of greatest density the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which corresponds to an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1, or randomly a light intensity of 2, correspondingly, reduce the density to compensate for a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it to compensate for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the vivific correction reduces the brightness of pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the image with these options. you only have to adjust the exposure of the image, since you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want to fine re-adjust the exposure of the target image, let the values for luminosity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digikam; image editing from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetting correction applied to a picture. the original image (1) shows the vivities in the corners and (2) the corrected picture. a luminous and contrast correction was also carried out in the picture with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digium; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm developed by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. coloured distortions can not be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree covers the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar effect, but flattens on the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient fourth degree corrects the distant corners opposite to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometrical distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of distortion second degree. with negative values tonnenical distortions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of distortion fourth density. this value has a stronger effect on the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses the 'corners parameter' has the opposite callsign of the general.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size and thus leads to a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive image size decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brighten: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values they raise.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog box illustrates the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are stored and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tonnage or cushion-shaped correction should be performed prior to all cutting or size changes. the best way to reproduce this correction is the first. if you have to cut a picture and then perform a barrel-shaped correction, the effect would appear apparent to falsehood.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal help line. move the mouse cursor in the image preview to display the dotted lines. move it to an important place, such as the edge of the sea or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting picture will have black corners. you can remove them using the cutting tool in the Edit menu Edit from the image editing or via the zoom knob of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some motives, such as shots from the front, frames and paintings, is the perspective to correct all angles in the picture 90 degrees. note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the barrel-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate the infrared film of the GimpGuru.org website which is available under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 iinfrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters for movie grading and film sensitivity (ISO). enable the option Add movie gradation when you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO knob changes the amount of film grading and dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter mixes color channels for reproducing infrared film, especially the Green Channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos because colour information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filmezer applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the edited picture below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a type of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digishot; Filming Filming is an easy-to-use tool for reproducing film particles on your images. this is known by classic high-speed movies such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturers mix large silver grains of photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film body effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated image gets rid of a timeless ambiance from daily life. if you want to use this special, gallery-like, street photography, grainy view especially in your monochrome photos, you need to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">The regulator can calibrate ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although frequently higher values are needed, set to ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film production effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and the edited the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digium; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright-protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">Der & digikam; Filter of oil paintings gives your digital images a nice appearance like an oil painting. nature pictures and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">The top selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better for large images. flatten the smoothness or, from the other side, the hinges.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the editing is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 Pixel large picture is 1 and smoother 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The lines that define the outline in drawing are emphasized. pictures whose gradients are slowly changing are not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you have chosen to outline yourself. this would be good images to start with it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two regulators with a range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper regulator chooses the pen size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoother).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon label. the original image (1) and the changed picture (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">Der & digikam; Filter engraving shapes your image in 3-D, as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The filter engraving is a fast tool to reproduce your images with a 3-D effect. it works especially well in pictures with a simple structure, in which colour is not the most important of the contents. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey, monary landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the edited picture (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divide the image into cells and make it look like it is viewed through glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogous to the waveblocks 1 the image is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blurring effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom blur: wipes the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from a central point. this simulates the sharpness of a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blur: wipes the image through rotation of the pixels by a central point. this simulates the sharpness of a turning camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blur: wipes the image to create the effect of a non focused camera lens. the object seems to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion blur: wipes the image through horizontal motions of the pixels. this simulates the sharpness of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photograph, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softening blurring: wipes the image softly into the dark and strongly in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton Effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or to add a warm and subtle light.</seg>
<seg id="620">Shaking blur: wipes the image through random displacement of pixels and thus simulates the sharpness of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blurring: finds the colour basins in the picture and wipes it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divides the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it, by filling with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make regentropes on your picture. this gives natural your pictures a wet appearance. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drops. because the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes change the optical effect of drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can keep an area free of regentropfen with the & digikam. use the selection tool to choose the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you then start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of regentropfen.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the Regentropfen Filters. the original picture (1) shows a quiet sunset and the edited picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it into the correct orientation by mirrors or turning. you can find the tools in the Transformation View or Transform mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo blowing is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom in a picture when the limits of resolution are reached? how can you reinvent or guess the missing information? the CImg algorithm used here makes a good job here. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose to change the size in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool to change size uses a linear interpolation method to approximate pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality then try the tool to inflate.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a type of interpolation, e.g. Spline interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo inflates was developed by IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS labs in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the tab New size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary when a lot of noise is found, because it is then difficult to appreciate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons save as and loading are used exactly for this purpose. each stamping for photo can be saved as a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Blown photo is very fast for what it does, but it can take a long time and load a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo inflating by enlarging a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged image (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear standard magnification.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photo is not only a frequently performed operation but also a frequently underestimated tool to put together a picture. to trim a photo you just have to create the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you'll see this rectangle while moving the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut off. this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by dragging at the corners of the rectangle. create a new rectangle by simply dragging with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the edit, use the knob The trimming button of the editing pane in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the File Save or File Save button under the File menu to save the newly added photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="644">Cut into the tool After the aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as a portrait format or landscape format. in the high format, the greater value of the height and in the cross-format of the width is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">This means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimetres, inches or any other physical size. for example, you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog, there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in the dialog you can use the Max. ratio knob the area to cut to the greatest possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool to trim the aspect ratio stores its settings dependent on the image orientation (horizontal or vertical). if you use the cutting tool the next time, these settings are saved as default values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are saved in the EXIF tables so that the EXIF data will reflect the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the support help enable you to hide aids, so that you can put your pictures better together. these aids are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic divisions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third rule, harmonic triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle into a similarly harmonical triangles at the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden centre: the golden centre is a division of different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaf leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all kinds of things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it has been used with the ancient Egyptians and Greeks used to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division at all times when you put your images, buildings and even photos together to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number derives from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the resulting divider is 1: 1,618 the golden centre. a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides more liquid auxiliary lines when you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos. compared to the third rule, the golden spiral generates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition results the viewer's gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">A further rule are the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. this rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. that can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles also derive from the golden spiral discussed above. their vertices are the middle points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles are not equal angles. diagonal to these lines can place a static object dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use golden triangles to break your frame, create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can not achieve otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options horizontal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast the auxiliary lines can be invisible. this way you can customize the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate a picture to any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">When you make a photo, it's easy for you to keep the camera vertical or horizontally. this creates an image in which things rotate around a corner. you can do this with the digital camera; image editing and the tool free rotation. choose Transform Free Rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slider angle. the values on this slider are specified in degrees. with the Preferences button, you can set the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown right above.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the cursor in the picture preview to position the two lines. after you have moved it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After filming a picture you will find undesired triangular holes in the corners. one way to fix this is to use the function transformieren trimming from image editing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the Automatically cut. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The Anti-aliasing option smoothes the image a bit after rotation. however, note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectival transformations are performed around a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview is then automatically recomputed. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation into pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation into pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left at the top: displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: displays the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Corner right down: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image is slightly dirty. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adaptations generate a double the strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective you get unwanted triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean this is to cut the picture with transformer cutting from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The shifting tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite. this is no turning, the image becomes distorted. in other words, a rectangle becomes transformed into a parallelogram. you can start this module by transforms scissors.</seg>
<seg id="679">Scissors your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. you can scrub horizontally and vertically at the same time. if you click presets, the angle will be reset to zero. a preview of the effect will show you and the new dimensions of the target picture are displayed right from the preview area.</seg>
<seg id="680">For your help, a vertical and a horizontal line appears. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the locking tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have carried out the shear, the picture becomes a bit blurred. for a single shear this effect is usually negligible, but two chings generate twice as much interruption and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shear, the image has triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate these is to cut the image with transformer cutting from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digikam; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. therefore the available formats depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries are compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependency of other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF below.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digikam; shows only files in formats that know. this is based on file expansion and a comparison of this with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the list, you can change this list of file extensions the & digikam; accept more information about this.</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you to select even the format to be used. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in the Wikipedia. & digikam; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the use of data compression methods on digital images. redundant information is reduced in order to save image data to a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. in general, there are better, smoother results than JPEG at the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also save losses as specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw image format, you can read from Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful manuals in English. you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter by & digikam; you can find further information on how to use modules with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="690">& digikam; Supports the loading of raw images only with the program dcraw, which is in & digikam; all supported cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coffin. the table below shows a short list of raw formats that of & digikam; supported:</seg>

<seg id="699">If you change steps 4 and 5, what you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good, then you can carry out the first four Justifications with the module white balance.</seg>
<seg id="700">Many tools you need for photo editing are included in & digikam; your description follows here.</seg>
<seg id="701">All image editing tools such as sharpening, softness, noise suppression, refocus, blurred masking, & etc;. use a single dialog box that displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image. below you see & quot; Texture user quot; in this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="702">(1): this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current picture. to the left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area. these modes are:</seg>
<seg id="703">Vertically parts without duplicates. the left area displays the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="704">The upper area displays the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="705">The left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter.</seg>

<seg id="707">"" "" "" "mouse over" "" "style: shows preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original." ""</seg>
<seg id="708">(2): there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over- and sub-exposure. the colors used can be adjusted in the general setup page.</seg>
<seg id="709">(3): the frame to select the preview. you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and click on the part of the image from which you want to see the preview. the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately.</seg>
<seg id="710">(5): in the lower left corner: here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values. all settings from the last use of the module are noted.</seg>
<seg id="711">The sidebar properties displays the essential information about the selected image and is largely self-explanatory. it is grouped in the following sections:</seg>

<seg id="725">Graphs are used in science, in particular in computer science, in particular in computer science. so far there was no modern & GUI; program to visualize graphs. the programs, which & graphviz; contains, are according to the program author obsolete & X11; - or & tcltk; -programs with just a few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kgraphiviewer; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kprintviewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; graphs. the & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. & kgraphiviz; displays graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & works; and & konqueror; (so that a change of the graph is in & unique; the graph is recomputed and in & kgraphiviewer; represented)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graphs in & ate; to open or to open the graphs in & kgraphiviewer; in a & unique; component to open</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems starting from about 1000 knots and a hack to show more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Further required software: & kgraphikiosk; is a & kde; program, which presupposes the & graphviz; -tool & dot; for displaying the graphs requires:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in a separate sub-window. in the beginning, if you start & kgraphiviewer, the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot. in this case, the toolbar contains only the symbol file and the (empty) list contains all open files. click the first icon to open the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="733">After selecting one or more & dot files, the main window looks like in the lower screen shot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special keys, left and right with pressed & Alt; key);</seg>
<seg id="736">Zoom is limited by factor 10 in both directions. below you can see the maximum size reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the file is just changed in & kgraphiviewer, the loaded file has been modified by another program, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph should be reloaded or whether you want to ignore the change. if you want to change your decision later, you can also make your decision later. if you want to change your decision later, you can change the menu item Settings kgraphiviewer; set up..., see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">When you open a graph file outside a running & kgraphiviewer; instance, & eg; in the file browser or at the command line, you have the choice whether you want to open a new & kgraphiviewer; instance, or want to display the graphs to be loaded in a sub-window of the current instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option you can save your choice permanently, but these can also be changed retroactively with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">At program start you can open all graphs of your last session again. once again, you can save your choice both as well as change later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how the graph is to be divided into several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you use multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph, which come on one side, will be adjusted to this page. the aspect ratio is ignored. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled from the respective sections of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with a graph distributed on several pages without header and with another font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Renewable Load page gives the option to specify the behavior if a file has been modified on hard disk, & eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically reload or ignore changes) or ask the program each time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The page Open gives the option to specify the behavior of & kgraphiviewer; set when a graph is opened outside a current session. you can set a default behavior in this case (open the graphs in a new window or in a sub-window of the already running session) or determine that each time is asked.</seg>
<seg id="747">The site administration page gives the possibility to specify the startup behavior of & kgraphiviewer; you can set a default behavior (open or not) or determine the last session files, or decide to be asked at every start.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, which normally appears at a click in the main window with the & RMBn; opens up further options:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose between different & graphviz; select layout algorithms. the entries as described on the & graphviz website are:</seg>
<seg id="750">& dot; -Algorithm, the standard for directed graphs. it produces hierarchical or layered representations of directed graphs. the algorithm places the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge cuts as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for non-erized graphs. it produces representations according to the springspring model. the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used, which is synonymous with statistical multiple-dimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & fdp; algorithm creates a springspring model for non-executed graphs. it uses the Fruchterman-pure gold heuristics, and includes a multi-grid solver to treat large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & circo; algorithm arranges the nodes circular in accordance with the description of Six and Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command that is executed by a shell. the command should output the graphite file as parameters, and output the calculated layout of the graph to stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command you can give & eg; the & graphviz; change the graphs with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Determines the type of graphs (directed or executed) and turns the standard algorithm for the respective type (dot; for directed, & neato; for non-finished graphs).</seg>

<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and store new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan pictures: use the Kooka interface to read pictures of a scanner that supports the Sane project or another source such as video streams. to do this you have to have Kooka and Sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you open the images to scan the images, a dialog will appear which allows you to choose between all available sources on your computer. select the source from which you want to pick the image. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that the Kooka window appears in order to select the default value ducrat to select your image accordingly. view the preview and adjust the range to your needs before using the button scanning the image. the estimated file size will be displayed in the right, lower corner. in the Kooka manual you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure the window is completely displayed, because some settings may not be displayed otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="778">After you have pushed the button scanning, you must wait until the scan is completed and the window for setting the options of the image appears. please remember that the type BMP is not compressed and therefore creates very large files. you also need to select the folder & # 160; select or create by saving the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">You can create screenshots after selecting the Import &gt; Screen Delete menu. a window appears in which you can set the different screen photomodi:</seg>

<seg id="797">The module export to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time you are guided through the process of generating a token. this is used for your authentication. it is thus quasi your ID to Flickr. a browser is started so that you can log in to Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After the successful login, the module can send photos to Flickr's website. the following page will be presented after a successful login.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after you have pushed Yes, you will get the dialog for uploading photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">When the module exports to Flickr for the second time, you will be greeted with the following dialog showing the current permissions that the module displays. at present, the module does not support other authorizations. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The Add Photos button should be pressed once you have set all other options. with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. clicking the OK button starts uploading photos to Flickr Server.</seg>
<seg id="803">The keywords field can be filled with a list of words separated by comma. these are added to the image as keywords during loading.</seg>

<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographic localization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. the geographical data is stored in the EXIF keyword of the image and the localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization provides tools to locate images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, length and width are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographical data, you need a GPS Track as an XML file in gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization correlated. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu. the above-looking dialog appears then. to load a possible correlation of time and localization, you need to load a trace file with GPX file. of course, this file contains data that were taken at the same places at the same time as the pictures of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded an automatic correlation is done which shows coordinates in red. GPS Track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT. this can be done with the time zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for maximum time deviation gives an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time. lies the deviation below, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you do not have track data from a location for pictures you can manually edit the gpx file and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all pictures in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options Interpolishing and difference in minutes can be used if you have no matching data. if you know that in reality a location is located in a great time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button correlate to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place. as the dialog is the coordinates of a call to the next you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set with the displayed map. select the respective region and enlarge sie.Add this again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the height must always be selected manually. the card can be changed between card mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside of the KIPI module there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the images. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums in a gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that should be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to enable the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted. you only need to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML. the albums are not displayed hierarchically. with the three buttons on the right, you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the section below will display the Albenpreview and the text that will appear in the top of the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="824">The rider's appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this rider is largely self-explanatory. the option for each image to create a page creates a gallery in which each image also gets its own page. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer, & eg; kickshow, displayed</seg>
<seg id="825">The tab Album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be stored with all your associated images. for this purpose, select a folder on which you have write permission. a subfolder containing the name KIPIHTMLExport, which contains everything, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG File format, the EXIF information of your original pictures will also be stored in the new pictures.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth, you can change the default color depth. naturally, it also influences the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The thumbnails allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumbnails, which are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window indicates the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">When the module has created the pages the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the programs to see if errors occurred while generating. the web browser is automatically started at the end to preview the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL tool for viewing images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI picture viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rotations, zooms or moves. the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse clicks. it has been developed for fast image detection and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start a picture is displayed in full screen mode. this can be changed in a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossfree module is a tool to change images without compromising your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the below actions, without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of lossless storage is that the file size increases since no compression of the color information takes place. this can also be found in PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool for connecting your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing these, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team under kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI-Module Metadata Editor does not currently have any documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the kDE-imaging @ kde.org mailinglist of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">The Import function of the metadata module allows you to copy data from one image to another. select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function. this will then open the file selection dialog with which you want to select the target image, so the image to which you want to copy the metadata. the data will be copied once you have clicked the button OK.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not write to any target format. JPEG is supported while writing. please look at exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG encoder module is a tool to convert a number of pictures into a MPEG video in the form of a slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG encoder module can be used to convert selected images to MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the packages MjpegTools and ImageMagick. between the individual images you can insert a basic image transition. you can also add an audio file in MP2 or WAV of the slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are scaled automatically to the correct size for the selected video format. in addition, you can select a background color for the slideshow. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first select the images that should be packed into the MPEG Slideshow. after that you can start using Tools MPEG Diaschau to start the module.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected by you are then listed under Image Files in the Portfolio. there you can also modify the images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you're happy with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from different formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to play the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step you should specify the time in seconds that a picture is displayed. the speed of the image transition is specified below. a low value generates very sudden, a high contrast very smooth image change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in case of doubt, you should let it black. you can specify the name and path of the generated file in the name of the MPEG output file. keep in mind as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file with the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. depending on the speed of your computer you can start drinking a coffee quickly or quietly and enjoy the slideshow when you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If an indication appears that encoders or tools are missing, you can customize the paths to programs of MjpegTools and ImageMagick Packages via the Settings button on the right.</seg>
<seg id="852">The Print Assist allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g: useful to improve you or print directly with the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original fake of Him is: do not expect from dcraw that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the raw file to convert and start the module. the Raw image converter window will then appear in mode for a single image. with the Preview button you can preview the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings for the white balance are to be used. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected to allow you to use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename remains the same, and only the extension is adapted accordingly. JPEG uses a loss-related algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image Format, TIFF, maintains all the information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you plan to edit your images often or otherwise use it later, you should not choose the JPEG format since it allows only a limited number of operations before the image quality is worsened. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is contained in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file in the exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start converting the conversion with the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch Processing Mode allows you to convert different images at once. so use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing on a single image which is the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, you have the possibility to overwrite the existing file automatically. this is helpful if it was created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion is progressing.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used for renaming all pictures of an album. you can set the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can zoom or enlarge the image.</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): resizing in two dimensions. the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to customize your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: not proportional scale change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Preparation: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, edge and background color, is adapted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your favorite e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the pictures to be sent before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the picture window will be displayed with the images you selected. click the Add images to add more images to a file selection dialog. for the last selected image, a preview will be displayed on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag and drop images to the picture list to add a list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">Removing pictures will remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">Once you have selected all the images, you can use the button OK to open the New message window of your e-mail client. you just have to add the addresses and the subject area. the images you have selected are attached as an attachment.</seg>
<seg id="877">Do not make sure to send too many pictures at once. most e-mail accounts have limitations to the size of emails to be sent. it may be a good idea to send several mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration will be saved and re-used whenever you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you choose Thunderbird, you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail Service, you must first install the Gmail agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in a attached file, the comments to the pictures are added to a text file and attached to the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the File Format File menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and do not need to change the photo quality. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG with image file format and the original files in JPEG format are then the original-exifdata will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not be closed automatically so that you can preview the status messages, in search of errors. your e-mail program will be started automatically at the end.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the Advanced Diaschau module, a window will appear with questions like your slideshow. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL-transitions option in the presentation enables very elegant image transitions using OpenGL. however, you have to have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The File Name option ensures that the filename of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an infinite loop. you can then manually interrupt it with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option pictures randomly selects that the images are displayed in a random order. so it is not used the order of pictures in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The time distance between the images can be set between the images. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect.</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select. by chance, every transition between the pictures selects another effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slide show, you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to switch you.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and next image and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">On the left lower edge of the screen you can see the current filename, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">If you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team under kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module uses the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of submenus, as background for your KDE working surface.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your pictures and videos with comments, you can use & kphotoalbum; through these browses, see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the picture, now in each group, so in people, places and in group keywords entries are present.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you can see the categories for which you have entered information as you have provided your pictures and videos with annotations. additionally, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you press the mouse over the entry, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">When you select another person, only the images shown on which both persons are visible. by this method of selection, you can restrict the number of images shown by a few thousand images on a few single images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the people, places and other settings, you can display thumbnails to view the images of your range.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the image, each person has the same icon in front of her name. you can use & kphotoalbum; however, you can save your own preview image for each person. this also applies to places, keywords and other categories that you have defined by yourself. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">In order to display images in addition to the names, select the button located on the right side of the toolbar. in the appearing context menu you can select which view you want to use for the current category separately. this has the advantage that you can display symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you do not have suitable pictures for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">You must, however, define which image to be displayed for each individual person. in order to do this, you need to select the image view window (described in more detail) and then select a categories editor, as shown in the picture. here you can customize the image for the corresponding person. in the view window, you can customize the magnification factor according to your wishes and selecting which part of the picture to be displayed or edited.</seg>
<seg id="906">If you access the Find entry in the main window, a dialog will show you that the dialog for setting the image properties is very similar. you can view this dialog once more.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the field labeling or description, the descriptions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to be searched; the date can either be a part of the total date, i.e. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the bottom part of the window, you can browse all images according to certain names as you can see in the picture. here, after pictures, on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum;. if you do not like to read manuals, but prefer to try different functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and take a look at the quick entry, the screenshots and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and in the first dialogue, select the demo, if you start & kphotoalbum; for the first time, or select the menu entry kphotoalbum; then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of & kphotoalbum; try it.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a related HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar is shown here:. as the name implies, this bar displays date-statistics on the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can display several different time units. each bar indicates another unit. you can switch between the units of years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can preview the displayed entries from the database (if you select a date, the first picture of this date will be displayed in the preview window) and also the timeline displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the Preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select an area of timeline by holding down the mouse button and dragging the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, so the time data. if you select an area, you will only display images of this time period in the preview view. you can abort the selection by clicking on a bar of timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides you two ways to create HTML websites with your images. the one is available in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other available as a module (see). in the following part of the user manual, the in & kphotoalbum; integrated version, which you can create via the menu File HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages, you need to make some adjustments. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and goal. in the following, each section is described more detailed.</seg>
<seg id="919">First enter the title of the title and a description that will contain the HTML file later. on kphotoalbum; HTML sample pages see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & kphotoalbum; export file should be created which is visible on the overview page. more information about the export files can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Lastly, you can choose which information to be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid information displayed to the viewer without notice. for example, that all images are from a party. please note that & kphotoalbum; currently all images are exported. you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from particular viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can define how the HTML pages should look like. most of the settings are unique, which is why they are not specifically addressed.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the pictures. by doing so, those who view your website and own a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no longer download images that have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you have set. so it can browse your images with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission time. if it wants to get a picture bigger it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, set the different folders and the URL where your site is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">It is best to select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you need to select the main folder in which all your images are stored. this folder will be stored and automatically added next time. this allows you to select a folder or a KDE supported protocol for all future images, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After creating your images, you can check if these are all visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser, after the pages are created, started. the URL you set here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not in the final destination folder, you will need to manually copy them to it. so that the import function, see, correctly works, you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder where all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings that have just been described have moved all three to base folders or URLs. a subfolder is created in this folder whose name you specify in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; you may want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures. however, if you have already spent a lot of time to add image information, people on the pictures, recording location, etc., then you need to do with & kphotoalbum; do not make this work even more.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum, you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file. these can import others into your database. the image properties are imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim -files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are saved with the file or if the file is only a link to pictures. the advantage of storing all images in the file is that you have all the pictures together and that you can pass on this file so independently. the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can either export a .kim file directly from the File menu... or along with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches for the images in two ways. first, it searches the images that are located in the .kim file folder. if the corresponding images are not found, the images of the URL you specified when creating HTML files will be searched. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting images is described, which you can export via the File Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim -files. there are three choices available:</seg>
<seg id="938">With the Automatically option to copy near the .kim file, you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatisch option to copy near the .kim file, copy & kphotoalbum; the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal zip files. as most images are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worth to compress the files. if you want this, simply select the option Export file.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is maximum picture size. if you send photos to your friends, you may not want to send the pictures in full size because the .kim file would otherwise be very large. for example, you can limit the size by saying that each image should be maximum 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File menu item... select, & kphotoalbum; import the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard for importing consists of four steps. first you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folders the import pictures are to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalize the category people of the file to be imported (if you are a domain), while this category is in your database persons. therefore, you will be asked in the third dialog box, which categories of imported file to be imported and which categories they are in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. for example, see the image.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse and view images: if you look at images, you often want to jump inside different picture groups and see a picture with your friend on it, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will take the various steps of (1) Setting the information about your images, through (2) browsing and viewing, up to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum has been started as a program to manage your images. however, it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual you talk about pictures, but often this includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; saves all of its information in the index.xml file in the top folder of its images. it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, such as normal backup tools, copy to a floppy or revisions in CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; notices the folder in which your images are stored and use it again in future starts. if you want to read another folder tree with pictures, you can start & kphotoalbum; for example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the menu entry Settings kphotoalbum; set up... you can go to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of the user manual, the various settings options will be explained.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols with which you can access settings of previewing and options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available which you can invoke by pressing the F1 button and a click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It is described as you can define different properties for each image, e.g. people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as items, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">You can see the dialog which is used to edit existing groups. for each group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section, sub-categories were already mentioned. in the Options dialog you can set up complete member groups, e.g. all members of a group at once in a group, instead of explaining all groups of a member as stated in the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the list below you can select the settings you want to set up. in the left side of the window you can select the category you want to configure. in the left side of the window you will find a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub-categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; shares its modular system with other graphic applications, such as digies and Gwenview. this modular system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image plugin Interface. more information can be found on the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called over the menu modules. the modules can and are not described in this manual as they are not part of & kphotoalbum; but most modules have a help page that you can access via the modules itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are shared by multiple applications together, it may be that the modules were tested with & kphotoalbum; therefore, you should always test new modules with the demo database before you use it on your own imagery & kphotoalbum; Demo database, you can either use the command line with the command &gt; kphotoalbum -Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu Help. don't say I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications using the modules via KIPI are very different, making it possible that some modules with & kphotoalbum; do not work. this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & photoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications order their images in albums: this is an album simply a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this type of order does not support, it simulates the order according to albums, so that you can use the features with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">Thus simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album, which is simply the current view, so all images that show you the picture preview currently.</seg>
<seg id="963">Next to the current album, & kphotoalbum; the modules also have a list of albums. here's & kphotoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s Browser shows the content of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category you specified in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. for example, if you use the category people, for example, will do & kphotoalbum; so do so, so if you would have selected individuals and pass it on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the settings dialog and select the modules you want to load them.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start & kphotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, you'll see a menu and a toolbar at the top. currently, you will see the window with which you can browse your image database. currently, it does not contain a lot of information, as you do not have any information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to see each image with annotations. this includes information about the persons depicted on the picture, etc. you can set each image individually or for a larger number of images at the same time. if, for example, on all images Jesper is pictured and all pictures were taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for searching and browsing, as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these remarks if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">You can see three lists with a text field by specifying persons, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; since you will always use them when you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is to shift the images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and on all 50 images the same 5-10 people are depicted, you can, so that the names used are moved upwards, the persons can find and assign more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetically sorted list, click on the icon for sorting by date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected annotations for each image individually, you may want to edit all the selected images and add these images with annotations. in this case simply click on the above and back buttons, which are located below the thumbnail on the right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have taken several images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item More added entries at once with a comment.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the United States. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as a supergroup. to show you that it is a supergroup, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the comment dialogs it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over- or sub-category. in addition, you can also simply drag an entry to a category and place it there to make it an sub-category of this entry.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the comment catalogue by clicking and Move the boxes that form the top edge of the boxes. you can also make a separate window from a frame by dragging it out of the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adjusted the appearance of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings, click the Options... which gives you the opportunity to save the current structure and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also hide a frame completely. if you want to see this window again later, use the Options... button and then hide the window. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the images in the browser, you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected images, or any pictures if you have not set a filter. you can see the size of thumbnails by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image will be set up as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this is displayed in the image viewer. if you haven't opened a window with a viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the image preview. simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and press either the Remove button or select Delete Select from the Edit menu. now the window will be displayed you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can use & kphotoalbum; namely images also use without you to have stored on the hard drive. of course, you must have the images stored somewhere, so & kphotoalbum; you can view the view from & kphotoalbum; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images in which the right upper corner is cut off are not stored on the hard drive. however, for the images 5-9, however, the thumbnails are present, so that & kphotoalbum; you can view the preview of these images. however, you can't view these pictures with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see, this function requires that you copy files from the folders and then copy them into. & kphotoalbum; if you want to avoid annoying your images, please buy a larger hard drive to store all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the Pictures menu you will find a submenu with the name privacy. if you want a little more privacy, filter the pictures so that in the end those are left you want to make for others inaccessible and click on current view locks in the menu privacy. alternatively, you can also select all the images that your little sister can see, and select the menu entry All except up-to-date view.</seg>
<seg id="990">This allows you to specify which images to be hidden in the case of the case. if you give the laptop now your little sister, simply select the item entry images, eliminating all the images that you have locked. if you want to get the pictures again click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to set a password that must be entered for blocking the images. to set up this password, simply select password in the privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure. on the one hand, all images on the hard disk and on the other can access the password as unencrypted text or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection is only to those who are using & kphotoalbum; not very familiar to repel the view of private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you all have your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours to describe it is natural that you want to look at them sometime. for this reason, & photoalbum; through an image _ and video viewer. this can start from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. he of course shows the image, but additional all the information you have entered into the image, such as who is on the image, when and where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the info box on the upper part of the image you want to see, you can simply drag and drop them with the mouse. you can also configure which information to display and whether information should be displayed at all. all of these options are available after right-clicking on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">If you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Helene. as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have loaded several images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and image. you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos1 and the end. these functions are also accessible from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as slide show. & kphotoalbum; then loads a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer's & kphotoalbum; it is possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode the viewer uses the full screen on the screen. simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer, you can pull in the picture and zoom out. to zoom up, you can simply pull up a rectangle with the mouse. the minus key zoomizes into the middle of the image. shows how a zoom rectangle is selected and shows the result of zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the dot button you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. with the co-key, the zooms set, so that every pixel on the screen matches a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work with videos that are in and out with the plus and minus key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the turn functions from the context menu, you can rotate the image. this does not work for videos. you can make notes to the current image with the menu item notes from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at images it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture. in the moment you can view this Cancel and configuration dialog of the image to enter this name. however, you will probably prefer to mark only the image and view more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper. to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark it as well or poorly while you view one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to see pictures with features while viewing them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a characteristic by pressing the corresponding letter. in view a picture where features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">As soon as you have set features on your pictures, these are available in your browser. so if you have all the pictures you edit, print or whatever you have selected, just add all of your notes. this is described in. you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in preview view. if you want to display categories in the preview view, then you can add features to the images by simply press the characters for the attribute after selecting the image. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. for this case, you allow & photoalbum; to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The mixture is not stored with the image but in the database. in the way you can undo your painted afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In order to view the painting mode of & kphotoalbum, select on the painting from the context menu. to exit the painting, simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler, you need to use the program & Povray; not completely master, but the documentation to & Povray; should you absolutely have read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wiremodell- views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects simultaneously. but not the object of an already selected object, since all objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the object tree, select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu item in the Insert menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following pop-up menu will be displayed to enable you to select the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">Deleting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button context menu, you can remove previously selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to apply these changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message is displayed with an error description. then you can correct the input errors and click again on users or reject the changes with Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; enter the user documentation in the Setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object by means of help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this property. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can preview a preview in the Properties tab.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Click Preview in Featured View and a small sample of the scene is rendered using the selected texture. as default, the entire texture is rendered, even if you want to render a part of the texture (for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), tick local.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screen shot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and thereby change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the location for shifts. you can change the shift through dragging with the mouse inside the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a level of visibility as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher-level object or as absolute value. objects are displayed only when they are selected or their level of visibility is smaller or equal to the visibility stage selected in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window arrangement, or if you need another arrangement, you can set them arbitrarily. you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different configurations.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window over or under a present view, drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then displays the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the tap to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange several views on one another, drag the starter in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the map line at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement is hovering views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to view a view from anchoring, drag the tap on the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing left in the connector bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the connector bar. to prevent closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them at any point.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can be saved with View window order... Save. it will display a dialog in which you can save the window order under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render them. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 up to date. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on the Rendering icon in the toolbar or select the scene from the View menu.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert any number of render modes from a fast preview to full pictures of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or in the View Render Modi menu, the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but useful is a name that lets you recognize the features of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the picture, select the check box section and enter the image section for rendering to the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination field quality, you can select the properties that & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diffuser Reflexions illumination. a detailed description of render properties can be found in the user manual page & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel, different errors can arise. these images often have a Moirè pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called Anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of this error. in general, pictures with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you turn on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one ray per pixel. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as a standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling the adjacent pixels with one. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively, because every pixel is split again and again and adaptively because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray pursues a ray of pixels. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixel passes the predetermined threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 will be charged, at a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays each pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the predetermined threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels that are separately pursued and checked for further classification. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is to reduce the creation of noise for the beam process called Jittering. if you switch jittering, alter & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for the quality of the rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; the diffuse light reflexion is calculated. it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding rays hit no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly completed, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray, select the menu item import... and select a file in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently, & kpovmodeler; Not yet the full command set of & Povray;. if error messages or warnings appear when importing error messages or warnings, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; import, write this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this adds the source code of the object to the opened text file in the editor. to import objects to the scene, simply mark the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">Copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can add source code for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on the help in the Properties tab, open & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation to the displayed object. place the path to your document and the version. support the versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (e.g. elevation field data) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files not located in the folder of the scene, you also need to enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in camera view and in the window type identifier.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object beginning of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotation.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time to render. for some objects such as the sphere, you can set the level of detail separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross High level of detail for extended projections, all wire-model views are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions to the perspective and vertical projections. this property provides a better approach to projections, but requires more time to renew.</seg>
<seg id="1068">If you cross a wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is represented in a chess board pattern from two selectable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the floor, a floor below the objects is rendered. the floor is represented in a chess board pattern from two selectable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">When activating edge smoothing, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used for rendering the scenes. you can set the values for depth and threshold value. you can find more details about the parameters in the section Render-Modi.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can modify existing window orders or create new window orders. the window orders section explains how to create and store window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The combination field Standard window arrangement: displays all existing window orders. & kpovmodeler; uses the chosen window arrangement when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing window orders displays all existing window orders. you can create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Remove button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name displays all views for the selected window arrangement. new views can be created with the Add button and deleting selected views with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with new column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with Unten anchor the window under the existing window, with card card you will get a map view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you would like to start without more detailed knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should create the ultimate yet simple scene, among beginners very popular: a ball on a plane.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result, you only get a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules can be applied for rendering, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">When you do not insert any light sources, your entire scene is in the dark, and you only get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything error-free, see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following pre-set window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar. please read the documentation so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols often, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; start with a simple scene. to follow this guide you first need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu item Edit Delete.</seg>
<seg id="1085">This is the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera. this is the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you can see the contents of the view properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation to & Povray; see more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera is in view of control points with which you can change the target point of the camera. simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you press the Applicator or the Enter key, the wire-model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result they see the scene from the camera's point of view.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. for example, you could insert a header (inserting end body Quader) and the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome method of solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually provides a simpler way. you can use an infinite plane as ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the layer in the object tree, change the name and then press the Applicator button or the Enter key. in the object tree the new name is immediately displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire-model-view now also indicates the level even though at the moment only as a finite plane. if you render the scene, the plane stretches up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look at the object tree exactly, you will find that you can fold the entry for the bottom if you click on the symbol + in front of the object. in this case you will see the different parameters of the object. in this case, you will find only the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and displacement. select one of these options, also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line, just to get to know some of these parameters. select Shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the bottom to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something Simple at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog opens where you can select how the object should be inserted. please choose the first object. the pigment will then be shown in the object tree. you can change the name in the property-view (Name = Soil Pigment), with a click on the button preview see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigment just shows a matte black material because you can still enter settings for the pigment. keep in mind that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview. now, give you the colors for the pigment.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you see no color on the header and the ball in the preview, just click on the Applicer button and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your image now with a click on the symbol, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, these are not the colors that you have expected. here are still more settings necessary. in the color list you need to enter two new attributes, called Monochrome. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more often, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, select single-colored and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should you already be able to perform, as you should have understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; the ball can be created just as simple as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In view of the object properties, you can instantly change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget the input button or the button Apply), so the ball has contact with the ground. otherwise, the ball would float above the ground, as you have shifted the ground around one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, rendering now results in a strange result: as before, the ball surface appears like a matte black material. set a suitable material in the next step.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball you can assign a material now. as already with the floor, give the sphere a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select first object and change the name for example in sphere pigment. click on the sphere Pigment, then select Unicoloured and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screenshots and click Apply or press Enter.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings gloss effect and reflection results in partial good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metallic: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what possibilities you & kpovmodeler; offers. hopefully, you've learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracycing is a render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you track a scene raytracen, the renderer shoots hypothetical rays from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) through each pixel in the scene. the render is calculated, as this ray is reflected by the objects, and how atmospheric effects such as fog are affecting.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a light source you can also see nothing, the image is simply black. obviously, every scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog you can select a file you previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this submenu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it is stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and a disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Recovers the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage are discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you have not saved any saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last one-hand commands. this menu entry can only be selected if you have used edit catchy.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window order and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting up & kpovmodeler; here you can change the appearance, shortcuts and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the shortcut shortcut. you can use this option pre-set short commands for & kpovmodeler; change commands or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up the toolbar. you can use this option tool symbols for & kpovmodeler; add and remove commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump-map is a way to prefuse rough surfaces without having to model each bump on the surface individually and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is customary to use the same file for both dump map and textured map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that can be used as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of this base body. these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture mapping is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis, by applying a picture file as color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a web browser in which you can select images for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very easy. the file browser lists files that you can click on & LMBn, or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set whether any image should be displayed in a separate window, or whether all images should always use the same window.</seg>

Select.</seg>
<seg id="1182">You may set up existing multi-media buttons so that they work as & Amarok; thus make your keyboard to & Amarok; control center.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many general functions which are mostly found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browser, player, playlist, playlists browsers and scripts. an example call for the DCOP function break could be & zb; look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command-line options of Qt and & kde; in addition, Amarok has some own command-line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script can't be executed because of a lack of dependency. please check in your script if all the required modules are present and use the dialog so that the user will know why a script is not running.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Korundum' rescue LoadError error = 'Korundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings V3.4 is required for this script.' 'kdialog --sorry' # {error} '' exit end</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as a basis for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Using DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command, which should be included in each KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages enable the execution of external programs and commands. for this purpose, the function exec () is used. this way dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends notifications to all running scripts. for this purpose, strings are written to the default input of the script. for this reason, scripts should continuously monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events. of course, a script can ignore events even if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Switch the script to display the setup dialog. to save and load the setup data, each script must take care of itself. if a script is started, Amarok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signalizes that a new piece is sucked. the script could now & b; with DCOP functions, ask for more information about the new piece (for example the metadata or the piece length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume Change newVolume Shows a change in volume. the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Customizclicked: submenu itemagraptor Contains the path to the selected files of the playlist, when a custom menu entry can be clicked. to add an entry, the DCOP function dcop Amarok script will use dcop Amarok script removecustomize MenuItem (submenu itemtitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; terminated, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to handle e.g. cleanup work. this includes storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amarok's script management can also install script packages that the user and zb; downloaded from a webserver. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which can optionally be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2). we recommend an archive name such as e.g. myskript.amarokscript.tar.bz2 so that the user can clearly see the archive as Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the populating amarokscript. for this reason, you should appoint your script packets correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules to be loaded should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file permissions:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can download it on www.kde-apps.org and add the link to the Wiki scripts page of & Amarok; for your entry on kde-apps you should use the category amarok; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & Amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use.</seg>

<seg id="1243">Amarok needs only the package kdelibs and no other KDE packages. you need to have kdelibs installed (including the included programs, because & Amarok; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a little guide on how to compile kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some features such as the OSD assume that your window manager keeps the relevant standards from freedesktop.org. Gnome will therefore work, but fluxbox will cause difficulties. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt because these provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably one of your files will make a mistake in the day lib library. you can locate the file by clicking in ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the taglib developer under bugs.kde.org and also hang up the broken file that caused the crash.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Most of the times it is because Taglib is crashes when reading the meta information from this file. please report this error to the taglib developer under bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for it in & Amarok; is more sophisticated.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure that all libraries used by & Amarok have been compiled with the same compiler version. if for example & Amarok; with GCC 3.4, taglib, but with GCC 3.3.X, this leads to crash when editing the meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd, turn off autom. switch off if inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least do not use at least no value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace via email (the email will open automatically during a crash). if this is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good backtrace, the bug is guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 in the meta-info, but don't identify them as Unicode. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>

<seg id="1326">Creating a playlist is very simple. drag items from the collection browser to the playlist. if you are happy with the playlist, then the tree view will only store the remaining matching entries. if you are satisfied with the playlist, you can save it with the help of the button Playlist. you will find this button on the toolbar of the playlist window.</seg>
<seg id="1327">If you have your own playlists, you can add these playlists to the playlist. if the playlist is in the folders of your collection, and you have the option to import playlists, you'll find different ways to load the playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1331">& Amarok; presupposes the installation of some software packages. the required packages are listed below. plus, some additional packages are listed, making work with & Amarok; more enjoyable.</seg>
<seg id="1332">If you install these packages via a package management system (such as RPM or apt), you also need to install the development versions of these packages!</seg>
<seg id="1333">& Amarok; is a versatile multimedia player. it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. like any normal multimedia player also has & Amarok; a player window with the most important functions. additionally, & Amarok; however, a playlist that is superior to all others. the playlist window contains several browsers with which you can capture and browse your entire music collection.</seg>
<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how all the functions of & Amarok are used, including creating a collection and a playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The Player window is your one-click & Amarok; control center. at the top of the window is a runtime display showing the current piece or the current running stream. directly below is the area, the game time, bit rate and sampling rate of the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1336">The player window also includes a selection of audio analyzers, even under the running text display. you can switch through the available Analyzer by clicking the left mouse button on the area.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press d on your keyboard and the current analyzer is displayed in an independent, larger window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Under the running text display are also the buttons PL and EQ. the button PL is activated or disables the playlists window while the EQ button is used to set up EQ.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons, the volume control and the play-position slider. use the sliders to adjust the play position or volume. with the playback buttons, you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or last item.</seg>
<seg id="1340">The use of the built-in Equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 presets from classic to techno, and you can easily create your own default settings.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To view the equalizer use Tools Equalizer from the main menu or click on the EQ button in the player window. once you select the equalizer check box, the Equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The playlist of & Amarok; is the most advanced playlist of all for & kde; available multimedia players. it has many features that do not exist in any other player. but don't let the abundance of functions deter you, they are all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlists window can be divided into two main areas, on the left hand side is the navigation area. in the navigation area, you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist, such as the context browser. on the right there is the playlist itself. the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users performance strong enough.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context browser displays different information regarding the current piece. its appearance can be adapted with the help of context browser designs. the context browser contains three subwindows: music, text and interpreter. these three subwindows are later examined in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & Amarok, you might notice that the startup window has fallen away. the information presented there is now divided into other parts of & Amarok; additionally, the information can be collected in the statistics window (Extras Statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The subwindow music displays information about the just running piece, as well as the interpreters and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this subwindow shows information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, artist and the album. among them you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz icon. click on this icon to track the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">You can find more information on the current piece under the MusicBrainz icon. see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time and its rating.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To display cover pictures in the context browser, the cover pictures need to be stored in the same folder as the current piece. the images may have any names, but pictures with the word front in the name are preferred. the context browser will also display cover pictures embedded either with the cover administration or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, suggested pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the recommended pieces are the favorite pieces of this interpreter. this section shows the five highest scores of the current interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set which information to be displayed in the music subwindow. click with the right mouse button somewhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, the interpreter's albums, lists all albums of the current interpreter you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will be opened and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately. you can also right click on it and then select one of the options to add the piece or album to the playlist from the pop-up menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">This feature is very flexible and it is possible to download text for writing scripts. once you click on the text subwindow, try & Amarok; to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if there is no text script running, you can choose which should be started.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics. the changed version is then stored in & Amarok; s collection database. there is no running text script necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The search button opens a search on google.com after the lyrics for the running piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping interpreter - only grouped the top level, each piece is shown directly below the interpreter. albums or genres are omitted.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Interpret / Album - In addition, the pieces are sorted by interpreter and there will be another distribution according to the respective album. if you want to see compositions or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Various interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping interpreter / year - album - Sort by interpreter and then after the year of the album in descending order (the latest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the standard 0 - album name is related.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabetically among each other. the interpreter is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping Genre / Interpret - your pieces will be shown first by genre and below by interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping Genre / Interpret / Album - This setting works just like the above, but is additionally sorted according to album below the interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons, you can customize and combine the grouping according to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically record your collection once you change something to the selected folders. if you own a lot of pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">A search filter is located directly under the toolbar. it acts in the list view as well as in the tree view. hints for using this filter can be found in the list of the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The search filter is a selection field, with which help you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection. you can also select different time windows from the last 24 hours to a year. you can of course select your entire collection, whereby the filter is practically switched off.</seg>
<seg id="1368">Clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser gives you the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This empties the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order into playback.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Attach to playlist - Adds the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on an entry you will have the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Tune the pieces in queue - this function adds the selected pieces to the queue. this will be played next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as a playlist... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist. you'll be asked for a name under which the list should be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Transferred to media player - Adds the pieces to the media player to transfer the pieces to the media player. see the section on Media Player Browser for more details.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this interpreter / burn to CD - The selected pieces are sent to K3b and burned as a data or as an audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for pieces)... - Opens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(n) Move files to the bin... - Create a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Highlight as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation, which prompts it to appear among different interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Undo compilation mark - Changes a record marked as a compilation album back into a normal album. after that the album will no longer be displayed under Various interprets but again among the corresponding interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlists browser makes handling of many playlists quite simple. among other things, he also contains Intelligent Playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlists browser contains the smart playlists. they use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists at runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with the pieces in your collection that has never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even self-created playlists are possible. click Intelligent playlist to open the dialog to create a new Smart playlist. there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The Media Player subwindow is used for the connection of & Amarok; with your portable media player (such as iPod). for example, to be included in / mnt / ipod. if & Amarok; started, you will find the pieces on your iPod by interpreter sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the performer list. if you're done, click Apply. this will upload the pieces to your iPod. when the transmission is complete, quit & Amarok; and solve the drive binding for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">The tool bar is a search area with which you can search for a file. the search is useful in folders with very many files, because in the file list all files are hidden which do not meet your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">For example tar: / home / mike / musik.tar.gz enter and press Enter, you can click on music in the file musik.tar.gz. now you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, the attachment of files can be difficult by simply falling down. in this case the holding holding of the Shift key can be helpful: by doing so, dropped files are automatically inserted at the end of the list, and not at the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">You can change the order by simply dragging the entries with the mouse to the desired position. as soon as you enter the letter there is only the pieces that contain the letters. to reset the filter, press the back button until the text field is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter by spaces separate search terms, & Amarok; search for entries containing all search terms. for example, if you enter one two three, the search will find all entries containing one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">For example, one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces are found containing one or two or three (or a combination thereof).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries that contain spaces, then fill the keyword with geese-feet: Mike Oldfield. this will be sought after entries which Mike Oldfield contain, but not by entries such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a specific search column, you can also search for larger or smaller ones. for example: rating: &gt; 50. this looks for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term, make a minus sign before the search term: -something looks for pieces that do not contain anything.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variants according to your needs. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 comment: bathroom. this is looking for all the pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield, or have a higher rating than 50 and not contain the comment bath.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the playback sequence of entries by holding the Ctrl key, and then clicking with the right mouse button in the desired order on the entries. then the entries will be marked with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The playlist of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window. it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist. on the left you will find the Add button to add the playlist to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons will follow feedback and restore. this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In the middle of the toolbar you find a unique, magnifying analyzer. the refresh rate can be set with a click of right mouse button on the Analyzer.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last button on toolbar is menu. it opens the same menu as that which you get in the player window over the right mouse button. through this menu you can set up & Amarok; 's configuration.</seg>
<seg id="1400">There are many other available buttons for the toolbar, for example playback controls and volume control. you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and set up Toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist. it displays the title of the current piece, the number of pieces and the total play time of all pieces. in addition, the status for random mode and retrieval is displayed. the status for random mode and retrieval can be easily changed by clicking the mouse twice in the corresponding display area.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also hide the status bar. to do this, disable the Status bar option in the General settings.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The context menu can be accessed by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window, or by clicking the playlist in the playlist. through this menu you can access the settings of & Amarok;</seg>
<seg id="1404">A click on this entry will open the window visualization plug-ins. there you can select the visualizations of & Amarok;</seg>
<seg id="1405">Behind this entry there is a submenu with links to this document and other information about & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1406">The Cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover pictures. you can start it by selecting actions cover administration in the collection browser.</seg>
<seg id="1407">The cover administration contains a list view of all albums in your collection. you can view all albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the interpreter on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1408">With the View menu, you can choose what to display in the cover administration. select:</seg>
<seg id="1409">The queue administration received your great suit in & Amarok; 1.3. with this feature you have even more control over the playlist. after you've set a piece into the queue, the playlist appears next to the title. this number represents the order in which & Amarok; the plays will play: 1 is played first, 2 as second, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1410">To manage the queue, open over Tools queue administration. if you want to add a copy of the queue, select the play in the playlist and then click +. you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist. then you can change the order of the pieces in the queue administration.</seg>
<seg id="1411">There are three types of dynamic playlists, two of which are already given (the details to set up these follow later).</seg>
<seg id="1412">Fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add other random items while playing.</seg>
<seg id="1413">Add pieces based on Last.fm's recommendations (formerly: Audioscrobbler). this mode requires that already some pieces in your playlist are located. you do not need a Last.fm profile to do this dynamic playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1414">Double click on the playlist you want, drag them to the playlists window or right-click on them and then select Load. this way your current playlist will be replaced by the new one.</seg>
<seg id="1415">The two pre-set modes of Random Mix and Playlists mix immediately fill your playlist and you can add at least one piece of your collection. the suggested pieces will be added to the next piece of play, so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1416">If you want to keep the current playlist, activate the last possible dynamic mode: settings Dynamic Mode. this will use your existing playlist as starting point. using the same menu entry, dynamic mode can be deactivated again.</seg>
<seg id="1417">The New button replenishes the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode. editing the playlist opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the settings.</seg>

<seg id="1473">A previously selected DVD video can be converted. this dialog appears usually after reading a DVD in the table, but can also be used anywhere. it contains information about the read video, encoding settings, and even ways to change the size and cut black edges.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Displays information about the pickled medium. this information is displayed in the table of contents and includes properties of the medium such as size and title length of the CD or DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Displays a list of the toolbar of & k3b; when an entry is checked, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">If this is checked, a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & k3b; and its activities. if this is not checked, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The folder view switches on or off. the folder view contains an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives. if the contents view is enabled, their contents will be displayed in the table. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info, locks and unlocking of the disk or ejecting the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The content view enables selecting and dragging files into the project view. the contents view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs, provided a drive has been selected with an appropriate CD / DVD in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The header is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the header bar has no real function, it only looks pretty and separates the project view from the remaining views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog window to change the button assignments for & k3b;. after selecting one of the available commands in the top part, you can adjust the mapping settings below.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This will start the k3b; setup wizard. this allows you to set the correct permissions for burning CDs and DVDs. for this, system administrator rights are required, so you have to enter the password for the system administrator (root) when starting the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Open the settings of & k3b; here, general program settings can be made. almost all functions of & k3b; should work on startup. this dialog is meant for personalization and fine tuning of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; applications also, equipped with a & DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface parts of the functionality can, for example, be controlled via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP, you can either use the dcop command line, or the somewhat more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical in functionality, so rather your taste and type of task is crucial to which of the included programs you give preference.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you use the dcop command line program. in order to use the & DCOP, you must first make sure that & k3b; started. then enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; features that have all & kde; -program common, supports & k3b; mainly two more parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & k3b; provides functions like copyCD, formatand other features to create new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">Void BICOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () void bocopyCd () void burnCd () void burnCd () void burnCd () void burnDvdImage ()</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can create a project using the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project using # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject Through using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the K3bProjectinterface listed above and the powerful K3bDataProjectinterface, which can only be used on data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString name, QString CARD) void addUrl (cString:: list urls, QString) void renameItem (QString path, QString newname) void setSize (QString id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, multiple folders and then inserts files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT addUrl / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; a reader for & kde;. with it can easily be read audio CD; s can be read and stored into mp3 or OGG files. also other formats are possible, depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; compression data in WAV files on hard disk) and by many encoders that code these WAV files (compressed). currently, lame for MP3, oggenc for OGGs and FLAC (lossless compression) are supported by default (These encoder packages still need to be added from the Linux distribution). more encoders can be added to the program (if installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD; read out and saved into WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these WAV files (usually one per caption) compress into the mp3 or OGG format or other formats like the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoders must be installed. however, all of these programs are usually not necessary to compile anything yourself. however, only the encoder packages are installed which are needed. if, for example, flac is not used, the installation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format should be used? the chapter Which codiers gives a small introduction about encoder, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word for copying protected audio CD; s: as already said, & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia for reading the audio data from the & CD; this program is not intended to bypass any copier protection. if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device manages the protection, it is not possible to bypass the mechanisms of copier protection. avoid the purchase of copier protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While set-up only needs to be done (the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found), the daily handling for reading a & CD is explained. this leads (hopefully) to understand the slim approach of the user interface, which you frequently stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which encoder programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; retrieve information from the freedb from the Internet or can work completely without a network, with everything manually recorded.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a brief list of the commands of the main window. on the page step by step example you will find more information about how this program is used as well as screen shots with descriptions of the tabs for configuring the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Starts the CDDB query on CD data according to the installation of request in the CDDB tab. (this can be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Starts reading and - if an encoder is configured in the encoding settings tab, the encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of encoders available so that the selection can be read with a different encoder than the default. it must be noted that the encoder has previously been configured in the Settings dialog tab in the Setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager so that an already read file is selected to code instead of a complete & CD; read and code.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the Setup dialog to configure the type of notifications (such as protocols, pipses) for program events (such as reading & CD; terminated).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog by & kaudiocreator; with different card cards (such as encoder, to set the encoder). here you have to go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoders and compression rates and helps you choose the right encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is needed. besides FLAC there are also others like 'shorts' or 'monkey' that may be available for this distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information by compression according to their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG may have an easy advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bitrate differences are less important as both encoders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame is nevertheless provided free with most distributions, but there are open license issues</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ High to very high sound quality (at high bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly lower quality at lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music should be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playdevices is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special auto stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium' = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard' = This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has already quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256' = 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. always requires 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all songs of a title. good enough for the music of youngsters, portable devices and car levels. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overdone for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is manually entered or fetched through the program from the freedb over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can hand / use with & kaudiocreator; and the encoding program to generate the folder and file name as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD; titles to the keywords (English: tag) when MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameters must be added by & kaudiocreator; the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs that you can download / type the information instead of typing yourself into the computer. it is important to note that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note from the Uebersetzers: therewith the author is meant) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be hurt.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; actively select a check box (sending an address). for the use of freedb it can be used with another (counterfeit) address than the one in the system. in this type of configuration, it seems, the e-mail address is not used when calling the data from the server (This can only know the programmer who checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; to use freedb, the geographically closest mirror server should be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and compares the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit at freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which program is used to save pieces from the & CD; to save into WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know it more accurately, search in the source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this has not yet been done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the read WAV files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. the first opening contains predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the tab to set up the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab itself.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoder package must be installed from the Linux distribution in question before the encoder can be used. this is also required for the predefined encoder. more information about encoders can be found in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a encoder, you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device description of the & CD; / DVD drive, write and read reviews on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio codiers of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flac & etc;). try to invoke both programs with a command line in a terminal. this could give a hint on what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check the envelope of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, all understood, but are still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and use our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bit rate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. for example, a suitable package for lame can be found with a search engine as it is considered as non-free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can do of course.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is and that you own write permission to copy it (eg by trying to copy something inside the conqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section deals with the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; something that is probably done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure to read a & CD; what must be repeated for each recording & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoder to be used to compression the music (lame) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps).</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not be able to change it every time you read a & CD; change once the matching settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is handed over to the reading program so it can read the & CD; -data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your disk. if this does not work or if more than a & CD; / DVD drive exists, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the entries of the device descriptions for CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The Map tab General Settings. here's not much to do. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything will be left / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only for incomplete information can be selected, so that you will be informed if information about the creation of keywords (tags) are missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are convenient and release the & CD; data automatically via the Internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the Internet while reading the & CD, so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second drop down box is simpler, a & CD; entry found, starts immediately the reading of the & CD; this is associated with low risk when you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag entries, they can easily be changed. the directory or filename is changed with Konqueror &gt; rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, keep in mind: if you want to manually enter everything manually, disable the selection fields and freedb will not be used if you download the database first. however, this is over 620 MB large, consider this twice whether this is worthwhile. to freedb in offline mode, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following card card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for querying the & CD; information from freedb server over the Internet. how do the system know which data to get the CD? read the section on freedb. set everything as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we haven't downloaded the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to freedb.org and look for a mirror server near you. on this way the load is distributed between the hosts. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equivalent to the server, as many firewalls will boot the protocol 8880 by default, perhaps there is more luck with the 80 protocol, since the protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we don't want to add & CD; data to the freedb server must be sent. the first check box should deactivate.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of pieces simultaneously: excuse, is there a reason why more than one at the same time with only an existing drive? parallelit reading and encoding? the author does not know, so simply try yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; ejection after reading the last piece: tick this to the & CD; discard at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined folders for temporary files: if you tick this, then / must be specified the path / folder where the WAV files are stored. if the field is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. don't forget to use this folder if you want to make something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Just type as it is on the screen shot. the command is a little long, under circumstances something needs to be left to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme' defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is average about 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the '--id3v1-only' entry for restricting the generation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags may also be deleted if required. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tag for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as shown in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of WAV files to be encoded simultaneously: with a dual core or Quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine, you can try to code more than one WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is it, we just have the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; terminated. this configuration is used as standard for any reading of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music smart, you never need to change them again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This section describes how the process of reading the & CD; the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, has been described and set up in the previous section. first, a connection to the Internet is set up, as we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freedb needs to be picked up.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not yet contained in freedb, the screenshots look a bit different from the data for a & CD; therefore you will learn the & CD; manually enter data instead of retrieving it from the internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Do not try the & CD; to find this example. it's a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this has not happened yet, then the & CD must now be inserted into the drive defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in the screenshot. this only if the & CD; as an audio CD; could be identified and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen then search in the Frequently Asked Questions and Answers according to the Help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully picked up by the freedb, all titles of the pieces are already filled and the name of the artist and the album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; a window will pop up, and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of freedb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for Settings), you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button on the toolbar. if you do not have a local database, but retrieve the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD-Editor - Input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Current title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must no longer be entered in the input field 'Current title' unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The bottom comment field can be used for the individual comments of inidividual per piece, the commentary field of the album is used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from the freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the next screen shot. however, it is always a good idea to verify the content of the CD editor, so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name, but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and on just 28 characters for the comment area. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least for what & kaudiocreator; maximum allowed. this option is set up on the encoding settings tab; take a look at the 'Default Settings' section.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later at any time using the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all coding or file formats. see the help of the encoder to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">For more information go to freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or rap, for example, are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After selecting 'OK' you come back to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor will appear again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data that we have collected for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are displayed above the list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that it has a check mark before each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected are read out. simply click on the line switches the selection of the piece, or press the All pieces selected at the bottom of the screen to choose all the pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">If by clicking on the button selection read out the reading process, this window will appear for confirmation. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what runs out.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab jobs to switch on the order window. it is located in the left upper half of the window, directly below the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window for controlling the orders. the first piece is just read on the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message can be seen if you are trying to work with a encoder that you have not yet installed. pieces that have not been successfully coded are marked with a red 'X' in the job list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we have typed here in the example. have you checked if you have write access to the folders for the temporary files and the destination folders?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The job 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3. this allows reading and encoding in parallel. note the status message in the bottom part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program does not have a configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and encoding. in case of weak machines, the result is unclear. the used machine with a AMD64 does not seem to have problem with simultaneous reading and encoding (of however two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read while another piece is encoded and a third order is in the queue of the encoding. after the last piece is encoded, a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiocreator, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you need the encoder of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1609">This section is aimed at people who compile from source files, and not intended for users who use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help, as the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running, then the following is right for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls for many different programs has many variants of settings. best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings. it displays screenshots of the different card-cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hi, still reading? even if only the help menu was clicked on after the first-time start of the program, without any indication of how to go on from this somehow empty screen (especially if there is no audio CD; in the drive), or from the unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What is it about? who reads this, probably already started the program. it should look something like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no email. the author cannot maintain this manual. it is the first version for a manual to & kaudiocreator; thought. whoever wants to add or change something useful, may it do. and if you read this, he has left this section and is therefore agreeing with this proposal.</seg>
<seg id="1615">Strange when you managed to get the source file from & kde; get SVN, then you don't need these Informations, but...</seg>
<seg id="1616">& kmid; ist der MIDI- und Karaokespieler von & kde;. besides others, he has a real-time graphic and Karaoke-real-time highlighting of texts also some features that others & UNIX; -MIDI players do not have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so should work on all systems with OSS and & kde; support also supports & Linux; Ultrasound project driver needed for GUS cards. ALSA is included as soon as it supports a sequencer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color, so it's easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical representation of the activity of any MIDI channel by highlighting the pressed keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & Drop so that you can drag in & kde; any MIDI file from a & conqueror; window to kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files (song events or text properties). kmid will automatically detect the process used.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Seat support. if you stop & kde; finish playing a song, kmid starts with the same song next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizers, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select Open... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog, which allows you to select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also allow a file from a & conqueror; window to the & kmid; window will drop. this also works with multiple songs simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the knob playing in the toolbar, select the listing from the menu item or press the space key.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece starts automatically once you pull it to the & kmid; (in several pieces you will be added to a collection and then played one after one.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once and kmid, play a piece, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and navigating with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click on the arrows left and right of the tempo display and so change the playback speed. to get back the original tempo, double click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the button bar acts like a pressure on the button Pause or selecting the menu item Pause in the menu item, so breaks the playback. press the space key while no piece is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music. some pieces use text properties, others use lyrics and others use both. some pieces have no text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid, you can set which events to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically retrieved that a song is used, so you will automatically adjust the karaoke text. however, you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set an event type, select the menu items or song events from the Settings menu. the same function also includes the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you summarize. these are played by the series. in this section you will see how you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find this in the menu collection under the point organizing.... Click here to New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specifying the name for the new collection.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the winnings in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection will not be stored. remember that if you add lots of pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, you must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song with the Add button. it will again appear the file dialog, which allows you to select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the Automatically add to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When Automatically add to the collection, a piece will be added automatically to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If Automatically add to the collection is not activated, when opening a piece, the temporary collection is activated and emptied. this collection will then be added to the remaining items.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To delete a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the series after the submenu sequence order from the menu collections, the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the drop down list above karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump a song further, select the Next song button, the next song from the menu item or press the button arrow on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song, select the Previous piece, the item Previous piece from the menu item or press the button arrow on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to be deleted and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter, since it is not saved when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers, which are not general-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map combines general MIDI events in events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI-map that converts all events of the Change patch to Bright Piano events in the Change patch to Trumpet type, making it possible to sound a trumpet when originally playing a piano.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have one sound card, you do not need MIDI-Map because all sound cards GM-compatible (incl. Awe and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI-Maps, so you have to edit the appropriate file manually (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that stores all the required realizations for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except for the keymap section that may appear as often as desired. however, the requirement for this is that each occurrence has a different textid (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define keymap "Name of keymap"... END Define keymap "A further keymap..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see Define is used to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an email so that I in future versions of & kmid; support can provide support for devices that are not general-MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section describes how the patches of General MIDI are displayed to your specific keyboard. general usage is as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you can't change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to set all the sounds that this instrument need to set to tone with number M. if your keyboard is not supported for example (GM Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to a gun shot.</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 (Win shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term Trommel Patch the patch is meant to represent another percussionist instrument (drum, cymbals, maracas & etc.) and not the one with which the sound means the pitch of the always same drum (like some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is needed to indicate how tones are displayed on a certain channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the order of rows is very important, as well as their presence. so you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and every instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to map sounds on the percussions-channel. take a look at the keymaps provided.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to another. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channel, just make it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for Keyboards, which have the percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI to Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">Midi devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel, which is shown on the channel N. if you use the keymap option, the keymap will be used with the name name for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which will try to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x will always be used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful, for example, to always use the percussions-patch on the percussions-channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The pitch value for pitch ratio indicates in which ratio pitch-Bender events are multiplied. so if a MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender event with the value n, it is converted to the formula n * (r / 4096) and then passed on. the value 4096 is used to avoid decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM shows that a keyboard, which is supposed to play a pitch-bender event with the value 4096, should play a tone higher. unfortunately, some keyboards try to play two tones up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI-Map, simply open the dialog MIDI Settings. you can find this in the Settings menu, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you see which sounds are played straight.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel. for each channel there is a drop down list where you can choose an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button doesn't illuminate green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (up to now) two different views to display the played sounds. view the View menu under the View menu view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The tempo LCD shows the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the bigger the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so if you find, for example, a song is too fast to follow the lyrics, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, & etc. thus, the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I cannot force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc. you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; that happens because it was compiled without AWE support. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's home page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree, therefore support & kmid; Drag & Drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, choose all the files and drag them to the & kmid; -windows.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Before, select Automatically add the Automatically add to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key on the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to recover the default tempo you can double click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & kde; -desktop a & conqueror; windows with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a MIDI file) or I want to play a file, just switch to the & konqueror; window and drag the desired file into the window of & kmid; draw.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection, turn off the Automatically add to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection. open files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. first you just want to play the first file. so set the Automatically add to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then you decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection of all three files. how do you do it?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, it animates me to program on & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; Malaga (Spain). I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; Ed. at the moment I am in the third year, so I do not have much free time for my hobbies, but I try to take a bit of time.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; have, or even if you want to make me happy, write me an email: Larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really make me a great pleasure if you send me a postcard from your home or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. all those who send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will record with friends of & kmid; but before you send a MIDI file, you should contact me as I might already have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have & kmid; completely written in my free time and won't get money from anybody. I would like to emphasize that I only want to programmer because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or e-mails).</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it's not the same whether you use a FM radio device or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, you must compile & kmid; compile with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you had a sound card, except that you can't hear music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the & kde; -mailing lists or send an error message directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& KMPlayer; is a simple interface for MPlayer, Phono and ffmpeg. the program is used to play video files supported by MPlayer or Phonon supported formats, as well as to play DVD s, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & kappname; was not finished yet as & kde; installed on this computer.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help please check the page The KDE website for new versions, or send the question to The & kde; send a user mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is a window with the playlist. and finally there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is shown in it.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred links under the menu bookmarks, but these are single entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category Continuous Playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy. if you ancake an entry, his group and all its sub-groups are copied to the current category and playback starts with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', television and permanent playlist can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files. of course you can only do this if & KMPlayer; not running. the various files in the directory ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer /, can be changed by an editor, but also by the application itself.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you need to select the playlist from the menu item and select either the editing mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without equal to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Due to the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer, some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation of starting and loading can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and change [General Options] No intro = 0 default option to '1'. if the option is not present, it can be easily inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & KMPlayer; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during boot doesn't need to be short, it will automatically terminate by opening another source. this would be disruptive in the end-animation, so the user can end the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of an animation can be the display of a favorite photos: & lt; smilgt; & lt; bodygt; & lt; img dur = "Save" src = "file: / / / home / Koos / mum.gif" fit = "meet" / gt; / smilgt; In the source package of & KMPlayer; are supported in the directory / some examples of SMIL supported by & KMPlayer;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the configuration dialog by & KMPlayer; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the 'Console' button in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here is the output of mplayer obvious.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this playback device in the configuration dialog by & KMPlayer; all must be configured by manual editing of ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc, just like setting the backend by mimetype. here is an example of how a 'flash' is played with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played within & KMPlayer; it can even be added to the specific field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">For the & KMPlayer to play 'flash' in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer; module as a service provider for the Mime type application / x-shockwave-flash in the Setup dialog file assignments of KDE will be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; can be started in a console application and search for error messages concerning loading the browser module library. the stolen process is called knpplayer. if there are no errors, the backend output is within & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu to check).</seg>
<seg id="1726">Thus always a given backend for a particular Mime type is taken (of course only if this has been determined), this must be done by manual change of file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, Phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play from TV cards, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be looked, the device will need to be used and the TV channels need to be used. for this, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To configure VDR (video data recorders) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog is included in the settings under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there, ports should be detected from which one is selected. the encoding to be used must be figured out (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a dvb included in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of KMPlayer can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this way of playing video equipment among Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the videoforlinux expansion must be functional for the X server. for the XFree86 Server it must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config)</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally by KMPlayer for the sources use different names. at the time of the emergence of this documentation, this is dvdnavsource, dvdsource, exitsource, introfaty, pipesource, tvScanner, TVSource, urlsource, vcdsource and vcd source.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Is there evidence that I can make my CDROM drive quieter when I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom can be used as root after connecting the device. it is absolutely certain that / dev / cdrom can be found on the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine starts only slowly, why does my CPU have to be checked for its performance every time?</seg>

<seg id="1751">If there is only a good night view to & latex; given, it is not the ultimate book about it. around & latex; to be able to master correctly, good books should be used e.g. H. Kopka / P. W. Daly, A Guide to & latex;: document Preparation for Beginners and Advanced Users, 3rd Edition, 1999 dafÃ ¼ r.</seg>
<seg id="1752">Just as other markers include & latex; an introduction to which the general characteristics such as paper format, page numbering and text size are specified as well as a body with the text. the introduction contains at least the command\\ begin {document} and must be closed again with the command\\ end {document}.</seg>
<seg id="1753">The Quickstep wizard by & Kile; is a useful function for fast creation of a document in & tile; the selection of the wizard (menu) provides some possibilities for the creation of the document.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Document Classes: this includes the type of document to be created: article (article), book [book], report [report], article (DIN) [scrreprt], book (DIN) [scrbook], projector [beamer], foil [prosper] or user defined.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Encoding: this is set to set the encoding. modern systems increasingly use UTF-8 encoding as standard. UTF-8X should be used (for correct processing of the & latex; -documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the most commonly used add-on packages for & latex; for embedding it only needs to be balanced in the check box.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Article (DIN), Book (DIN), Report (DIN), Cover (DIN): the documentation classes of KOMA-Script (to comply with German DIN provisions).</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users don't need to worry about this. it's just a brief description of the functions and further information about this will be given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& Kile; provides - just like other source editors - highlighting the used commands, settings and elements (as well as the unsuitable). by & Cile, it is very likely that any mathematical environment is not closed. however, you may have noticed it through the modest appearance of output file. however, it will save you by highlighting your time and time.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With the automatic completion of the environment, when entering a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) of & Kile; automatically generates a blank line (for input of the text) and the corresponding line to the lieutenant of the command (e.g.\\ end {command}). this function can be set in the menu settings tile; set up... LaTeX commands are disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually subdivided into some elements. & latex; allows the subdivision of the document to the following elements (part is the highest and subparagraph the lowest element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files can be very helpful when creating your own & latex. as soon as a DVI-file has been created, jumps and tile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI; viewer to the corresponding line in & latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is besides PDF the usual output of & tex; or & latex;. there are many tools for viewing, conversion and printing of DVI; -files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using reverse search, the elements of the DVI; file are linked with the editor and as soon as on an element in the DVI; file clicked, the exact opposite is displayed. as soon as on a section in the & latex; source code was clicked, the corresponding location is displayed in the DVI; viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used in working with multiple files. with a master document, working with other .tex files is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be configured for project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick-build: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (unless there are no errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File Monitoring: in this mode, the DVI; file is carried out on transitional datasheets and there is no call to & eyepiece; after quick installation.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the editing tool bar, the three large selection fields should be highlighted. the selection fields were developed for fast introduction of common elements into the document. the first selection field is for fast structure of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... The available & latex commands for subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection panel Further is for the introduction of items such as keywords, joint notes or references. the available possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command a name for a section, an image or other element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Cover: used for reference to a specified term (selection Ã ¼ ber a selection field possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote, a selection list is displayed with literature entries. for & bibtex, this only works if the file belongs to a project. for editing & bibtex; files are necessary editors. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files can be written in & Kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop-down box with the name GrÃ ¶ rø e is used for setting the fonts. it can be set the font sizes for the main text, the joints notes, etc. the following font sizes are available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & Kile, there are two selection options: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and stating the settings. 2. the document can be written from scratch.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets after the command\\ Documentation contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] specifies the font size. if the font size is not set at the beginning, this can also be done in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the source code above has been entered, the source code needs to be compiled. the simplest way to do this is the use of the MenÃ ¼ s Bauen or Knopfs Schnellbau.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved before compiling. & Cile; ensures storage automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compiling of the document is missing, it should be searched for error in the log file. when using quick-build, & eyepiece should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (environment environment) is a text which is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font size of 12 is created and only a few sachets shall have a different font size. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ loose and\\ end {environment} is then possible to embed the naming of the font nuclei within the surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are only included within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no limit (number) for the changes in an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the legibility and user-friendliness of the document. for example, certain fonts, grease pressure, cursive printing, submissions, etc. can be added. these commands either end with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the italic printing and is available until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in one set can be displayed using\\ emph {word} italic.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quota: creates a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ begin {quota} and ends with\\ end {quota}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Once the background was presented to write the source text with the & latex, then a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & casile is followed.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once a bit of text was entered in the wizard, a few adjustments should be carried out for the better readability of the document. for this, a quote, a few places in the grease and cursive pressure and a poem for the application should come to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document is viewed, the editor-view or Ctrl E can be returned to the editor (for internal viewer). with an external viewer, the windows must be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI file is created, the document can be printed or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a device independent file format. these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output like printer, & PostScript; / PDF converters or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI; file are the same steps as for creating the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI, the document can then be printed using file printing (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows converting the DVI; file to other formats. once the DVI output is created from the & latex; source code, the conversion can begin using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The prediction search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; provides a corresponding setting for all & latex files. to do so, just set up Modern in Settings tile... Tools will be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To execute the search search, the mouse pointer has to be positioned on a line of the source text and clicked on prediction search. the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI; viewer is then done.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; -document the corresponding & latex; -document of & Kile; open and sprinkled to the appropriate line. to do this & Kile; in & eyepiece; set as a text editor (configure the eyepiece... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If using fast-mounting the & DVI; viewer does not open, an error can occur. if an error occurs, it will be summarized in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file persists the source code in source code. in the editor, the pop-up LaTeX errors and layouts can be used between the errors. the log file always specifies the line in which the error appears. to view the faulty line, it must be clicked on the error in the logging and & Kile; jumps to the erroneous line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">As soon as the respective button is clicked on the toolbar, a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document. the preset options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting blank document, a document can either be rewritten from scratch or the wizard can be used for fast creation of a new document. for more information, see the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">FAQ users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be opened or a new file will be created.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template using the File New, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in settings tile... Settings can be set in general.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is substituted by entering document class. typically, it will be used as follows:\\ Documentation [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The simplest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated instructions in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps have been completed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, your own template can then be selected rather than the default.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files will be created. if a simple way to create a template, you should search for one on the Internet and follow the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Kile; used & works; as an internal editor. & works; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and originating from many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;). many adjustments for & works; can be made directly from & Kile.</seg>

<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as & tile; although & works; already outstanding features, have been added in & Cile; important functions for writing a & latex; source text added; special commands for their selection. under editing, the following commands for selecting text are included:</seg>
<seg id="1817">Choose a complete paragraph (group of lines that contain a blank line on both sides). this extended meaning does not include a text with common lines (as in other text editors). this extended meaning includes tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Select the word under the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning, since this command also includes latex; commands with a return line (\\) and an additional star (*) in the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete a part of the document, it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Delete key. & Kile; provides the key element Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. & Kile; provides with own commands for a faster possibility. under Edit Remove the following commands to delete the text include:</seg>

<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not recognized. but this setting here will be extended by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates a regular backup copy, so that during a power failure or crash the next start of the program can restore the document from this backup. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in one's own view (or documentation in a tab), which makes it possible to preview the documentation, preview and source code at the same time.</seg>

<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, debugging has been completely redeveloped. support for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) Debugger has been set, as well as support for the DBG debugger. instead, a Debugger plugin concept has been implemented that allows various implementations via plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only one plugin is available, support for use of & gubed; inquantaplus; insert.</seg>
<seg id="1975">Using the debugger for a project starts with selecting a suitable debugger plug-in in the project settings. with the Options button next to the debugger-Plugin selection field, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>

<seg id="1977">A view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed. normally appears in the left Dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view where all stops, with line numbers and conditions are listed. normally appears in the lower Dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view that displays the output (as shown in HTML) of the debugger. normally appears in the lower Dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported features of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">This action will make the connection to debugger if required, or it tells the plugin to listen to debug demands. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened, which uses a debugger, so that in the normal case you don't have to pay attention to it.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to Debugging session Start the session. closes the connection to debugger or terminates the listening to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP request to the server to launch a debug request. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Initiates the debugger to start executing the script and to send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution will continue. if it happens before a request is started, the script starts with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Initiates debugger to start executing the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, the execution continues. if it happens before a request is made, the execution starts once a request is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger executes the next instruction in the script without entering the functions or include cludes.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger executes the next instruction in the script, whereby if possible in functions and cludes errors will be corrected.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to skip the statement and go to the next as if there were not the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog in which a variable or an expression can be entered that should be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog, a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable is set.</seg>

<seg id="1996">This document describes how to create TagXML files, then the & descriptionrc; and also toolbar. short, a & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog, the & quantaplus; for the tag shows. the & descriptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. tool slides allow a fast insertion of tags into a document without danger of a writer.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but folder. they contain only the descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folders carry the name of the descriptive language and version, so present. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declares whether they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information when working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains nothing else than only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when used & lt; attr &gt; an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only valid for the type class. the name of the base class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the tag has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tag can be added to any other day. (only family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text into the dialog. this text is defined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is an element type element.</seg>

<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, an interface and a method name. the arguments passed to the method can be empty or% tagname%, which means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag which grouped the elements of a list. it can only occur for an attribute description. it is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of the attribute text of a tags within a dialog. this tag can only occur for each attribute in a dialog only once (e.g. for each & lt; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in dialog (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; tag). this element is empty.</seg>

<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements that end a day. this element is a only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files need to begin with a & XML; declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be tidy and closed properly.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces influence nothing, but pay attention & lt; sign. these should be replaced by & lt;, especially in elements such as & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; will not cause any leg departure, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog is in the top of the & quantaplus; to start window and select TagXML.. another dialog will appear whose simple instructions are to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, the check only takes place when loading the TagXML files in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">The following is an example of a family 1 tagXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this tagXML file will be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following one example for a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file a & PHP; overload function is described. the filename of this TagXML file will be overload.tag.</seg>

<seg id="2026">An action can be set with Settings actions... created. click New Action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">This action assigned keyboard shortcut. by clicking the Custom button, a shortcut can be assigned; with Keiner, the current keyboard shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be entered a text in the detailed settings and when executing the action this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful type of action. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that can change the document or use as input (or parts of the document).</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line, such as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. In this way, try & quantaplus; the script in the following places: $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we replace the current document URL. in case of a local document file: / removed from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus; if by & quantaplus; only one instance runs, the text will be attached to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document or path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above mentioned methods, a script can receive input from & quantaplus; input to the default input. in the selection field input can be specified, which is to send to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is normally only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can also be redirected. there are two types of output: normal output, written to the standard output; error messages, to the standard error output. it can be specified, which is to be set with the text written on the default output, setting the selection field output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the Markup language it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create an own toolbar for each group. in the given case, there are not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the markup.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a tool bar is added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts the edit mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all required fields and add the tag to the right tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and, if the tag has attributes and you plan their use, activate dialog "Edit Tag" when available so that an input is possible when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? replace it before we have difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action is better represented, we will & kiconedit; use. select from the & Menu;, Graphics More programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses standard 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol does not only help you remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day starts, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually considered as loose, starte, further interpreted), or should at least, a message to the user will be signaled that clicking this symbol is a & lt; startgt; tag in the current document will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it has to be connected with the action. this is done via the menu with Settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. next to the text field is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the saved icon is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags, so there is still some, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; functions to the toolbar, or it should be divided to a better overview by some separators into several groups. open the toolbar settings dialog via Settings tool slides. make sure that the desired toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separator (at the top left) for my toolbar. after selecting the element to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to give you a quick way to access the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separator support grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar may believe that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by copying all symbols to make sure everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Back up into the right folders. after NeweXML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please adjust their & descriptionrc; so that their toolbar (s) will be loaded (s) when a file is opened by the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like. that's why this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository check if someone has done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to search for an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE Configuration File [Tree] Doc dir = pfad, relative to this file, for example & PHP; 4.2 Documentation Section 1 = Section1.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.2.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.3.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.html tag1 = func2.html tag1 = func2.html tag1 = tag1.html tag1 = tag2.html tag3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can now see in the & PHP; documentation:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level elements Top Element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = introduction.html... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolders in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the depth of the box (except for reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">You notice that the Table of Contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folders will be displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing, but pay attention & lt; sign. these should be replaced by & amp; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resources will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file which is used to create context sensitive help. for example, if writing a & PHP; script will display the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. by selecting the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context help, the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file links.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of context elements separated by a line (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local and global usage.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure they are good and worth being shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, such as which documentation was used to the & quantaplus; -repository for use by the & quantaplus; community. you will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the failing resources (DTEP packages, toolbar with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by e-mail to friends, partners or else who are sent. at different points you can send an email menu item, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, send tool bar toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded to our main archive, from where all the other & quantaplus; users can download them. the contributions are checked and only available if our team has them as correct and useful for publishing. to contribute to a lonely contribution we recommend to sign the resources, for what it requires a GPG / PGP key. this will ensure the origin of the resources, both for our team and for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading you will be asked for their private GPG key after their passphrase (the passphrase is not stored), or in the event you have several keys, you can choose one. in the New Resource dialog you have to fill out the input fields (URL previewing can be empty) and click OK to start uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the DTEP DDTD menu (DTEP), toolbar working toolbar, and started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, still before installation, examine & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing. in case of problems it warns and it can then be canceled. please note the warning messages carefully. if the integrity is given and the resource is properly signed, a message appears with the indication of the author of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages currently not by & quantaplus; but creation can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in the tagXML format. there is the simpler way to automatically convert a DTD into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD Load and Converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description which should be used. after that, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Destination directory: the newly created & DTEP; is written in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Definitionszeile: the string that appears in the! doctype tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of DTEP after conversion: if enabled, brings & quantaplus; after conversion the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. in order to understand these and get full benefit from & quantaplus, one must first familiarize them with these fundamental concepts.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the working area is divided into three areas: global, locally and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, the & quantaplus; utilizes, available. from Toolbar to actions is all that is marked as global, in the shared folder structure of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators to secure different toolbar, actions and patterns in the global tree, which then are available to everyone in a multi-user environment.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and tool slides. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a particular project. this can be anything from & CSS; patterns up to toolbar with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply said this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which emounds the joint use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the building views, the card spreaders with information and the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the map line with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document matching entries, such as close the current, other or all the trays, reload, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the editor area guide to another context menu with regard to the edited document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / copy / paste), editing the tags located under the mouse pointer, using the word under the mouse-cursor or opening the file, when the string is labeled a file under the mouse-cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the upper end of the editor window are the toolbar of the editor. at present & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as a standard for which a set of tool slides will be shown. in the course of further expansion by & quantaplus; the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbar is really easy. if you want to insert a single tag, e.g. & lt; paste it into your document, then click the icon that represents the tag. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (like anchor), you can fill different fields in a dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The building mannerves (QIT;) allow to navigate in the information to & quantaplus; to navigate, open and roam. in the representation of card spreaders are available for files, project, pattern templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view displays all files in the project and allows managing files in the project by right mouse click. actions like addition, removing, uploading or deleting the files from the storage media can be done with the context menu displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: images, program parts, an entire website & etc. there are all options open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on what context they are used. the category depends on the & quantaplus; workspace. global templates are always available, local templates only available for the corresponding user and templates in projects can only be used in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of integration in Global, Local and Project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the available information into a script. further functions are available via the right mouse button, such as starting, editing or sending an email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, you display the internal structure of the active document. by clicking an element, the cursor in the document is set to the position of the element. by clicking an element, a list of commands will pop up with reference to navigation and refresher of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears under the other tree views. with it, manageable attributes and namespaces can change. the application system, which is aligned to the content, enables the change of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation of the web-technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be appended, edited and viewed project-specific documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two card riders at the bottom of the window, via the useful information can be reached: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab shows information about each in Quanta running script. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to the DTD are shown.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the Markup of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts executed, give all error messages (as there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; Toolbar is extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they will display the corresponding command. the chocolate side of the toolbar is the option of defining your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as compressed Tar archive via & kmail;. if you receive a toolbar in an email, you can back up and load them in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the & quantaplus files on your system. for this, autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, enter. / configure --help.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems starting from & quantaplus, you should check if your path is the & kde; 3 bin folder contains. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in PATH before their bin folder is located. the same goes for & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During the effort to create the best & html; editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what would be, if & quantaplus; a standalone, expandable Markup Language editor? well, this would make him the absolutely amazing web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer for pure & html; limited, is & quantaplus; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive Web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML, then & quantaplus, then the appropriate & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above claim must be held that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; developer community based. & quantaplus; follows, in good application of free software, the idea of Why develop what someone else has developed? thanks to the & kde; -rumours is not only this all possible, but it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. using self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation can increase almost every task.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More information in detail is help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; enter, or khelpcenter help: / Quanta run).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and managed by Eric Laffoon sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not located on it, where the oldest entry is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use. if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts the special characters contained in the clipboard there, so that they are displayed correctly and are not misunderstood by the browser as a form of formatting.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Convert the text from the clipboard in & URL; writing which is the correct way to include special characters and whitespace in & URL; s. primarily for inserting & URL; s into the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Activates the block selection. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; script error messages are out!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a type grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window in which you see the display of script functions and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Switching off the problem reporter at the lower edge of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated once you change to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the toolbar at the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmark with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with the entries Previous or Next, depending on the cursor position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard disk. & quantaplus; -Projects are saved with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Displays a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this enables, for example, to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub-folder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Loads the files in your project on the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; from and if you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO Slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings such as & quantaplus; the project manages. in the chapter & quantaplus; -Projects you will find the details explained.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project toolbar. these are stored in project Dir / Toolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this only creates the name. actions must be set using Settings actions... Added. Toolbar will be saved by toolbar working toolbar, or you'll be asked when prompting whether you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. this doesn't delete it from the disk. if you haven't saved the toolbar, you'll be asked if you want to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team so that the toolbar is present in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows uploading toolbar icons to the main server, wherever anyone can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load a & DTD; which you or anyone else has made and convert to the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP are to be refreshed without the whole & DTEP; if this is global and a write permission in the global KDE folder is not present, the load fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded toolbar. if the standard (HTML;) Toolbar is loaded, there is a submenu standard in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags menu, followed by & DTD; -specific sub-menus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or deactivates the intelligent insertion of tags. currently, this works only with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent pasting means that & quantaplus; inserting using tool bar is denied whenever this day contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu, the available plugins are listed under the above listed menu items. click on it. click on an activated plug-in disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Chooses the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on the original; version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Selects the type of line end identification. very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms for development. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document by means of the selected & DTD; using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, changeover sometimes may need time or cause unpleasant graphics. it is recommended by card-card mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode, which corresponds to the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu contains an entry for each open sub-window. with the selection of an entry the corresponding subwindow will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Enables displaying the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog influence each application using the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Sets the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of & works; you will find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears in which you delete entries from the toolbar, or which can change the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help according to the context of the mouse-pointer but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find here the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should best be filled from top to bottom, as for example after completing the project name the whole directory structure is completed for the rest of the project. all these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift; F7 Project Properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for entering the project, for example foo. when entering the name, file is filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase letters and without spaces with the extension hoj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can find the server address of the machine you want to access, except you edit local data. either a name (hostname.examples) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If one leaves this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocol are used. depending on the setting of the remote host an adaptation could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a shared collection of files for different projects is used, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder in which the toolbar can be saved for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a shared collection of files for different projects is used, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local filesystem into the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static webcontent that you want to download and change. with server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Get attached if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project are to be included. if a project is started from scratch, not hook.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders within the main folder are displayed and you can make an accurate selection of coupons.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the root folder. you can select the desired files by hook or, by removing the tick, clips from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project project properties in the menu room in the subwindow profiles or Shift; F7 can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (placeholders), which will be ignored for project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to the top, including files listed in .cvsignore, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view that is loaded when opening the project. it can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows the debugger to be selected. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger plugin can be set with the Options button. in the case the debugging is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the subwindow profiles, high-loading profiles (see in) can be set as well as display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by showing a separate tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the Team configuration window, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration window, you can turn event actions and add, change or delete event actions. event actions are executed when a previously defined event occurs, such as the backup of a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default open & quantaplus; the last project that was opened.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select project... from the menu project or the icon project open from the toolbar. the dialog project will be displayed and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quantaplus; closed, the project file is stored automatically. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when & quantaplus; changed files will be found. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project manager gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behave similarly, but the entries are missing open and open with... in the right mouse button context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removal of the current profile. if only one profile is present, the button will be terminated to prevent removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password is kept in the core memory and forgot at program end. this option is useful when frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather unsafe password on the disk save option does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many upload profiles can be created to upload the project (or parts of the project) to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the server name for which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least, you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally this does not have to be changed unless the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your threshold, this is either a time saving function or a danger. use it at your discretion. the password is stored on the disk, so that it cannot be read easily, but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is just one set of files and toolbar. there can be many views in a project, i.e. by simply changing the view, various files and toolbar can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved, opened or deleted from the project or project toolbar, accessible through Settings tool toolbar project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has most to do. this helps not only increase productivity, but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus; to its own working method.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, Toolbar is in & quantaplus; the best way to customize the toolbar menu. use and Adding differ. adding tool slides will be discussed below in the Add tool section section.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and symbols can be set either using context menu (right-click on the toolbar), in which a new toolbar can be created, other actions such as the toolbar can be removed, naming toolbar or toolbar can be set, which can be specified in the dialog where you can specify which actions on this or other toolbar should be visible.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, additionally the entries will remove action and action will be displayed that are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbar and actions on them can set up Toolbar settings in the menu... and set Settings actions.. set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially document skeletons, code Schnitzel and files for linking. & quantaplus; used templates basically like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or link any directory available to the system. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the restrictions you imagine for the filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions presented at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are usually inserted in documents using links (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the templates tree under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be written by any text document. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. normally, more specialized documents can be created in appropriate subfolders. one makes a simple framework for the purpose and organizes the work in a corresponding way to be efficient. some examples can be found in the templates tree under global templates. see in for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template but the same text area. you can contain anything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl basis. some examples can be found in the preview room under global templates. see in for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for whole websites. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure for loading (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and choose File As template Save As Local Template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this has been done, note that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As template save selection as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can simply be dragged with drag and drop on the tree view template.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied to a template folder. all file management functions can be used, such as drag and drop or paste over the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder right in the file tree or in the project file tree view and create a site template, enter a name for the template, but of course it can be stored in the project folder, but of course it can be stored as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very target-oriented approach. you can pretend header lines and footers or link them dynamically with & PHP; create, paste or link them with them. in addition, you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates. each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder, right-click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection field with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is completed as soon as parent attributes are inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is activated by default and fits all except the tribal folders in the template menu. if a root folder is set so, it would basically disable templates in this path, unless they were explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder the pale would appear with something like text-building block. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a regular folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">This could be general headers or footers for all templates for a specific project and allows copying contents templates into a folder with special headers / footers to equip a whole presentation with matching headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (pointing to right mouse button press) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and paste templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; provides two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & source text editor, which is accessible via the View menu. the first mode replaces the editor window in two parts: the editor window and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -Page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and switch back to source code editor when changes are made in the VPL; editor in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor in a document containing & PHP; a small green icon displays the default of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; editor. to edit & PHP; it is still necessary to edit the source text editor. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that the changes are visible in the source text editor as well as in the VPL; editor is synchronously running. pressing F9 is enabled by this mode, while this mode is already active, the push button is enabled by the active cursor from a window to another, whereby the position in the document is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; editor and the source text editor can be set up via Settings Quanta.... After selection of VPL, you can choose between synchronization after a click or automatically. in general, the recommendation: a small chip for fast calculator and a big span for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Assuming you want to change the title of the website, it is possible to select document properties. this allows the editing of invisible tags when working with the VPL; Editor is also called when a new document is created with the VPL; this is used to reduce the manual encoding. this allows you to change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags permit the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click into the list enables the modification of the content, e.g. keyword on the column name and keyword keyword on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in the browser. you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list. a change over the list is just as possible with the meta elements. editing of CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file-open button and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursor is possible like in a word processor, by moving with the arrows. under rare circumstances the cursor behaves peculiarly. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted by typing and deleting by means of a back button or removeable key.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way about the toolbar, as in the source text editor. it is important to note that inserting tags before already existing identical tags is not removed, e.g. when a anchor tag is inserted with text, any other surrounding anchor tag must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbar objects such as the Tables Wizard or the Lists Wizard are disabled. they will later work in & VPL; in this release the tables or lists toolbar can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for examining style sheets. unlike other style sheets, search for certain elements is possible and the style sheet version can be followed.</seg>

<seg id="2274">On systems with a readline library installed, you can use the arrow keys to scroll down the previously executed commands.</seg>
<seg id="2275">Multiple commands require more than one argument. quotes can be used to commit composite expressions as an argument. & eg;: with the command "break & quot; * _ BAR _ @ quot;" as argument, a stop is set in a file named "break & quot; * _ BAR _ @ quot;."</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for comparing. so why & kdiff3;? let me explain briefly why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me only showed me the changed lines, but I couldn't see what had changed within these lines. and there was no evidence of the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a little nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could be differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparative windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function related & kdiff3; almost into a fully-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Even 3-way merge is fully supported. this is useful if two people work independently from one piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; helps you with comparing and merging complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in folder merging:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently have to check code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visible. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more annoyance, if somebody changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is the same, and the other is different in one line, the color displays which file is different. red color means that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but in different folders, you can make the typing work easier by typing only the filename of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 Ordner1 Ordner2 -o Zielfolder kdiff3 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 Ordner2 -o Zielonne</seg>
<seg id="2294">Open dialog allows manual inserting of filenames, selecting a file browser (file...) or selecting a last opened file from the drop-down list. the Open dialog will notice your selection and display it next time. you don't have to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Selecting a folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparison or merge of folders is initiated. if a file is selected for A, but for B and C, a folder, then uses & kdiff3; the file name from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When merging is checked, the input field is active for the target and can be edited. however, it is not necessary to immediately specify a output file. you can do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The set-up button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before starting with comparing / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison begins immediately. in open dialog you do not need to select files, you can simply close the dialogue with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which thought is behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to figure out how similar these functions are, this would be a relatively large effort. you would need to create two corresponding files, load them in & kdiff3; then you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you can do nothing from & kdiff3; only the drop down of text into a comparative window will be supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program than cut and paste (instead of copy and paste). in such a case your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Each Info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse rest for a while over the line.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is recognized, you can see the color which file is different. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files. this is good to see in the next section (merging).</seg>
<seg id="2306">When differences were found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (for C / C + + e.g., white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line separating the summarization column from the text is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines. if the line breaks are enabled, the line will be dotted with dotted lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparative windows) also has an info line with the inscription output:, the filename and [changing] when you edited the result. usually it contains text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the buttons Springe to next dissolved / unresolved conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparative windows are used, each difference is also a conflict which needs to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows, the group belonging to the group will be highlighted in all windows and the first row of the group will be displayed. (this will also be a jump in the position in the windows where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible.) This group will then be highlighted with the color background color for current area and each on the left appears a black bar.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic merge or by manual editing; then in these lines the text & lt; No row is displayed in the queue; this is only a wildcard in the event that you change your opinion and perhaps again choose another source. this text does not appear in the final stored file, nor in a marker that you might want to copy and paste somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; context flickr; however, appears in the clipboard when you copy such text from the result window. carefully go with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if selecting the sources ignoring the options, ignoring ignoring C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments will also be treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigates mainly with the image runs and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, page on, page starting, beginning, end, Strg-start and Ctrl-end, Siw as you can also use it from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the Auction tab, you can also use the other buttons for editing. with the Insert button, you can switch between insertion and overwrite mode. (default is the insertion mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group (as already explained in the section summarizing and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons to navigate with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous difference (Ctrl-below / Ctrl-picture Abwärts) or to the next / previous conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marker to the clipboard, you need to copy the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). if this is checked, whatever you mark, will be copied automatically to the clipboard and manually copying the manual copy. be careful with this option, because you could inadvertently override the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix variants use a line-feed character\, and Win32-based systems use carrion return + line-feed\\ r\. KDiff3 does not retain the line end of the source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also not using binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the last used files will be saved automatically at the end and restored next time. (menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3 set up...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a font with a fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use it.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">When you activate this option, differences are displayed in italics. if the chosen typeface does not support this representation, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be rendered to be rendered. on these systems the button presets automatically adjusts an odd color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is enabled, the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tabulator button. otherwise, a tabulator character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When you press Enter or Return, the return of the preceding line will be automatically used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is checked, each selection will be copied automatically to the clipboard. the manual copy to the clipboard is then deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line type you prefer to save. the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">Only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. the second step compares each line. in this step, white characters are ignored. even when merging, white characters are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) store a dump trace '\\ r' and a newline '\' at the end of a line, others store only a newline '\'. usually ignored & kdiff3; the car return mark, but then may be treated with different sizes in page-to-page comparison, but then like a white mark. during merging this option must be disabled. in default this is disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the first part of the analysis, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. in the result the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default this option is disabled. changes in comments will be treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The option is enabled in default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slow with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic skipping mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before going forward to the next unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Solves all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as a source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful if white characters are less important in many files. if you need this only from time to time, then use better the Select A / B / C functions for all unsolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the Automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments, if the options are ignoring or ignoring C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are dealt with in the chapter to scan folders and execute a merge. look for details under documentation for directory comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already an older version exists, the original version will be the suffix .orig. if such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further securing.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapts the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current running program. you must quit & kdiff3; stop and restart, so that the change is active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is positioned globally across the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Using the drop down boxes for coding appears a brief indication of what the local code is. (this cannot be changed here and has for you purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Customize the file encoding for source files. this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the encoding is individually adjustable for each file, even files with different encoding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">When you edit a file, you can specify which encoding should be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, you might not work with your codec. (for example, your files could be a 16 bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option, you can set the encoding of the output of pre-processing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Switch off this to suppress highlighting changes in white characters in the text or summary column. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignoring C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color coded text column. but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files. after selecting A & lt; -GT; B, A & lt; -GT; C, next to the normal yet another oversight column with the required information is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you would like to use the space available on the screen for long lines. simply hide the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes consider the differences and then decide abruptly to merge the files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the filename of the last source file as preset names for output file. (if this function is used to restart merging, then the name of the last used output file is maintained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own pre-processor that corresponds exactly to your needs. you can use this function for example to cut annoying parts or to correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is handed over to this external command first. if a normal pre-processing command is specified (see above), then the output of the command is used only at line balance. you can write your own pre-processor, which corresponds exactly to your needs. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility when setting the diff results. however, an external program is required, and most users do not want to program themselves. the good news is, however, that in most cases sed or perl is completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command for line synchronization to convert the input into uppercase: SED's /\\ (. *\\)\\\ U\\ 1 / '. *\\ 1 in the translation string refers to the found text in the first clamp pair. the\\ U converts the found text in uppercase.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated strings (info: / cvs / Keyword substitution). all follow the same pattern $keyword generated text $. now, the\\ _ BAR _ Log\ $\\\ _ BAR _ Author\\ _ BAR _ Log\ $\\\ $\\ $\\\\ _ BAR _ Author\\\\ _ BAR _ Author\\\\ _ BAR _ Author\\\\ _ BAR _ Author\\\\ _ BAR _ Author\\\\ _ BAR _ Author\\\\ _ BAR _ Author\\\\ _ BAR _ Author\\\\\\\ $\\\\ _ BAR _ Author\\\\ _ BAR _ Author\\\\\\\ $\\\\ _ BAR _ Author\\\\ _ BAR _ Author\\\\\\\ $\\\\ _ BAR _ Author\\\\\\\ $\\\\ _ BAR _ Author\\\\\\\ $\\\\ _ BAR _ Author\\\\\\\ $\\\\ _ BAR _ Author\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\ $\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you may begin to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example of a further pre-processing command for line balance. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and each hit is replaced by nothing, thus quasi deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you may want to perform several compositions at one time. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the compositions from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something else like perl -p -e's / REGEXP / replace / SCHALTER 'However, perl needs some details different. where sed\\ (and\\) needs, perl needs only (and) without the preceded'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor will be retained for the display and merging. the other operations only change the data that the line alignment algorithm looks.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases if you use a normal preprocessor, the line-like preprocessor sees the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with each function, the text changes or hidden differences, you may inadvertently not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge entire folders recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a suggestion for each object to merge; you can customize the suggestion before starting,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and show the simulated changes without really performing it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging single files. you just need to specify folder in the command line or in the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as the base. if no destination folder is specified, & kdiff3; folder 3 as the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, not the merging. to start merging, you need to select the appropriate menu entry or press the F7 key. (see more details.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folders, you will find a small message window of the current progress. if you abort the scanning of the folder, only the files will be listed, which have been compared to that time.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is complete, displays & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found during the scan is presented here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually worked together. you can fold up a folder by double-clicking on the + / -, or double-clicking on the object, or by folding the arrow keys to the left / right. the directory menu contains two functions All subdirectories fold up and all subdirectories with which you can open or fold all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double-click a file, the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case the connection pipe action cannot be selected automatically. if the merge is started, you will be informed about problems of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As seen in the above picture, the colours red, green, yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C.</seg>
<seg id="2376">However, with identical entries, the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical when their entire content is identical. then folders have the same color. with folders the age is insignificant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf again, which is only green, then yellow and later when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical but not B: copy B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if a folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode to synchronize is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified, and if the option synchronizes directories, then chooses & kdiff3; then select & kdiff3; then select the necessary action to make sure both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible filenames for output file only B; copied directly after merging & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and the option Select new file instead of merge (uncertain), then examined & kdiff3; when the files are different, but the same date will appear error: files are different, but the date is identical.. Solange such errors are not eliminated, the merging of the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During merging, a file is processed after the other. the status column shows ready when the merge was successful, and according to other messages, if something unexpected occurred. if the merge is complete, you should make a final check and check if the status is all right everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If the file comparison method is selected in the Setup dialog, KDiff3 will display further columns. these contain the number of unresolved, deleted, not white and white conflicts. (the column for dissolved conflicts will only be shown if three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (file or Odner), or all entries at once. if you have selected all together-time actions (even in all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you do not specify a destination folder, then in the Three-Folder merge mode C is used as the target, in the two-folder merge, B is selected as the target and when synchronizing A and / or B is used as the target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check whether all entries should be in the destination folder, also in the folder structure. there are some options that could be skipped by the specified entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the shortcut). to put only the current item: select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If inconsistent file types still exist invalid merging actions, a message appears that indicates the faulty elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialogue window appears with the options through, simulate and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you want to see what would happen without the really changes made. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then performs certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merging a single file), then a merging window will open (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When finished with a file, select / continue directory merge or continue or press F7. if you haven't saved yet, a corresponding dialog will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2398">At the end of the list you will see some error messages that should help you identify the cause of the problem. if you continue merging the merge (F7 key), you can choose to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in other ways before proceeding with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been combined individually, the entries (in the current session) will not meet again. even if the merge operation has been skipped or not saved, these entries are considered to be completed. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (Set up Settings - &gt; KDiff3...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files matching the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree. separate the pattern with a semicolon;. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. (eg. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders don't have to match that pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match that pattern are not displayed in the element tree. more than one pattern can be entered, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. presetting is * .orig. * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match that pattern are not displayed in the element tree. more than one pattern can be entered, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. presetting is * .orig. * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignores files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autotcally created files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder-specific can be set with a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some filesystems, files have a default attribute. in other filesystems a precurs. a file is marked as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the Elementbau or not. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">Links to files: when the option is turned off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Links to folders: when the option is turned off, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is turned on, the links will be treated like normal folders and recursively searched. (note that & kdiff3; not checked for possible recursions. a link to a folder containing a link to itself would result in an infinite loop and & kdiff3; crashes down.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistic columns. (the number of dissolved, unresolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files containing no text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders using a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the changeldate and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you some degree of security. please use caution. this option is turned off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to confidentiality of the change date. there is no real comparison instead. the files are considered identical if they are equal to size. this can be useful, for example, when copying the modification date. please use caution. this option is turned off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates the synchronize mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified. in this mode the suggestions for merging will be selected in such a way that both folders are identical. also, the results of merging files are saved in both folders. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging the newer file, it is suggested as an action. (this is considered insecure, because it will assume the knowledge that the other file has not been modified too. you should check this in any case.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, then the original version will rename and receive the extension .orig. If an old backup file exists with the .original extension, this will also be deleted without further backup. this also concerns the normal merging of individual files, not only the merge whole folder. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the folder merge-view remains visible to merging individual files; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want it, you can switch the option directory & text window to switch main window in the window menu and switch between the two views through change between directory & text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge. to do so, use the current file merge from the merge menu. once you save the result, the status will be reset and the file will not be merged once you start the folder merge.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status will be lost if you re-read the directory again: directory -Menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO Slaves. KDiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open that are located on local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive to a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. a few things should be noted:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative to und. or.. contain. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, idle &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the filesystem on the server, sometimes by the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows. then a file is always assumed as a link destination. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit the permissions or modification date. therefore, the permissions or the modification date deviate from the original. (note the option of confidentiality of the size.) (This is only possible for local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is currently as a difference viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP begins always the built-in difference viewer. to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button on the differences viewer and then select In KDiff3Part view from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally it requires & kdiff3; two complete input files. however, if it is used as a part, it takes a patch file in unified format. then it removes & kdiff3; the name of the original files from the patch file. then start & kdiff3; then start & kdiff3; the program patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror, you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - KDiff3Part. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; running as part, it only supports comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools named KDiff and KDiff2 (now there are compliments) are already available. furthermore, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff3 from the Diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I've been using GPL programs for quite a long time and learned a lot by getting into the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this way or are going to go that way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You probably compiled the program from the sources and probably didn't tell the configure script to KDE. configure the configure script in / usr / local, but then KDE can't find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). see the README file for more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are first treated as identical; however, if only a non-white mark is different, the line is considered not identical. iF custom lines Appear next to each other, this actually is coincidence but this place is more often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">This important information is lost if the result is simply saved by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C. however, this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this has been too large so far. you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; No src swept; appeared and the text cannot be deleted. what does this mean and how can that be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses already many colors to emphasize differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and misses the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">You can find a list of the latest changes under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog, or changelLog in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system with & kde; use the following command in the base folder of the & kdiff3; distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir returns the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">As & kdiff3; autoconf and automake, you should not have problems with compiling. should nevertheless occur, please report on the & kde; -mailing lists of it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift Delete) copy into the clipboard and erase the selected text. paste (Ctrl-V or Shift-Insert) insert the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position or replace the current marking.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only show differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you must renew the folder with the Update function after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">This also means that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder when merging. if the destination folder does not already contain these files, they are missing after the merge. (the behavior will probably be modified in a later program version.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if the lines are already present), they will be removed by clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default this option is disabled. differences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a mini preview of all virtual desktops. it is quite practical to see the running programs on the desktop, change their size, stop them or move them. this works both inside a working area and at several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual desktops as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; the movement is possible both inside a working area and on other desktops.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: when clicking on the empty Background of & Kpager, the context menu has only the two entries to set up... and Finish. if however, click on an application within & Kpager; however, the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minimise, maximize, on Desktop and Finish. the commands effect the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is checked, window within the & padstack; s can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other desktops.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is checked, in & Kpager; the names of virtual desktops appear.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Cross this field lets the & Kpager; view the numbers of virtual desktop. if it is displayed together with name, the names are provided with ordinal numbers, & eg; 1st working area.</seg>
<seg id="2459">When this field is checked, the background of each desktop will also be displayed as background in & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is checked, the running programs are displayed as small windows in the & Kpager; otherwise, only the empty areas of work will be displayed to facilitate their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon displays the window with its default icon and Pixmap shows a small view of the actual program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; main window can be determined: classical lets & Kpager; in a 2xn grid, appear, as from pager applications in some other window managers; horizontal displays all virtual workspaces in a horizontal and vertical line, which is very good for representation at the side of the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size that can display and move windows as symbols or with their contents.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right click inside & Kpager; and then set up selector selections... allows the dialog to appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently, this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor, such as & kedit; or vi. if you don't have a write permission for the file, you need to login as root or turn to your system administrator.</seg>
<seg id="2467">Da & Kpager; part of the package kdebase, you need a functioning installation of the KDE base packages.</seg>

<seg id="2480">& kmag; is a screen lupe. you can use & kmag to enlarge a part of the screen, as if you read a magnifying glass for small print or accurate viewing of a photo. this application is interesting for different users: this includes artists, web designers and people with visual impairment. this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for use of & kmag.</seg>
<seg id="2481">& kmag; is a very powerful application that constantly extends to new functions. it is optimized for use on high-performance computers.</seg>
<seg id="2482">If you start & kmag, a window appears as shown above. the main window of & kmag; displays the enlarged area of the screen. in the following, this window is called magnifying window. the image, which is displayed in the magnification window, is an enlarged area of the screen and is described below as a selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In the default setting & kmag; the area around the mouse pointer as a mobile magnifying glass. alternatively, you can & kmag; for this cause a selected screen area in the magnification window (drop down mode) or the setting of the mouse cursor at the edge of the screen (eg; on the left edge of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">Would you like to avoid that the mouse pointer is displayed in the enlarged window, select the mouse cursor position. please note that & kmag; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse pointer. this is always the default kde; / Qt; mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the drop down mode, you can customize the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse cursor to the magnification window and hold the left mouse button pressed, so you can capture and move the contents of the magnifier window. this also works with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you add the & Shift key in addition, press the & MMB, you can move the selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">With this combination you can change the size of the selection window. note that the top left corner of the selection window stays tight and only the bottom right corner is to move.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& kmag; has a lot of functions. you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer, save it into a file, copy it to the clipboard (to insert it later into other applications), rotate the image and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Starts or stops the update of the ad. stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Select the update rate (Very low, Gering, Medium, High, Very High). the higher the update rate, the more CPU time is needed.</seg>

<seg id="2497">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click once the mouse pointer persists for a while in the same place. it is meant to help people suffering from the RSI Syndrome (Repetitive-Strain-Injury Syndrome) and any mouse click pain.</seg>
<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click once the mouse pointer persists for a while in the same place. it is meant to help people who suffer from the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and those of any mouse click pain. furthermore, it can emulate pulling with the mouse. however, this requires a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can bypass the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you may also suffer from pain caused by using your computer, you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear: even if & kmousetool; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse, it is against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic aids: the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">Using & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click once you break the motion shortly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the intelligent move is activated, power & kmousetool; a pause after pressing the mouse button. move now the mouse, wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button. in this way, you can execute the dragging with pressed mouse button. the intelligent move requires a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This weighttime must be petrified after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; a mouse click executes.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intelligentes shift on, the shooting range is active (1 / 10 s) active. here the time is set, the & kmousetool; after shut down the mouse button wait until it lets the mouse button again if there is no moving of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">This function activates, generates a slow moving to the right and back, followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click. these movements are stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt, when it is started, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound is delayed, you can & kde; move to shorten response time. go to the & kcontrolcenter;, go to Sound & Multimedia, choose Sound System and here the tab General. there is a slider sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool will start; at any start of & kde; start. this function is currently only available under & kde; please consult the respective documentation for GNOME or other window environments to find out how to start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Set all settings to the values set when opening the dialog. if you have already pressed the Applicator button, the settings will be reset to the stand after the last push of the user.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with the presets. in particular, the intelligent move should first be switched off. if you have become accustomed to the automatic mouse click, you can later add the intelligent move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times by & kde; to reduce sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should make yourself aware of which places a mouse click remains without effect: clicking on the neutral elements of windows or in places in the browser window that do not represent a link does not lead to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually quite simple. the trick is that you not only clean the mouse ball, but also the rollers that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to take the mouse ball out. as this happens, mouse to mouse is different. however, it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rollers. these are located at the sides of the hole into which the ball was inserted. the dirt and dirt can be easily scratched with a flat blade or a finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system breaks the execution of & kmousetool; if you use the intelligent move in this case, that means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; using a different window manager and moving a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you yourself perform a mouse click. this will reset the status of & kmousetool; and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cursor in another position.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor wherever you want it. however, drag the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop when you want to make a keyboard input. thus, a accidental move of the mouse & eg can cause unwanted reactions. secure zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the front lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with intelligent shifting, but I do not manage to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent move is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very probably possible to mark this way to copy it to the clipboard or to execute any other action you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the intelligent move if you just start using it & kmousetool; instead, select text instead: hold a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key while dragging the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouseclick. this will each time, if & kmousetool; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click. then you know exactly when when intelligent shifting begins the shooting time. later you can use the intelligent move even without the audible mouseclick. but this requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; to be able to use, the XTest extension needs to be installed for & X Window; that should be already the case on most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and is set up correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse pointer persists. this program was developed for people suffering from the RSI syndrome and causes pain.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured to allow a specific time waiting for a drag process to start before the mouse button is released. in this way also the drag and drop can be done with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2532">On the first page of the assistant (left screenshot), enter the command, which will be used later for the speech output of text. for more details, please refer to the description of the catalogue of information.</seg>
<seg id="2533">On the second page, select the default text passbook book. from the text passages you can often choose text passages without having to type them. the text passages can of course be edited.</seg>
<seg id="2534">On the third page (right screen shot) you determine the dictionary for the word reproduction. & kmouth; read the KDE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word. in addition, you can synchronize the wordlists with an OpenOffice.org dictionary, so that only properly speaking words can be added to the word.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The main window of & kmouth; is clear and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard input of your propositions (the lower white field in the screenshot) and a disk space of the already spoken phrases (the upper white field in the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2536">If you have kmouth; correctly set up, you can input the phrases you want to hear in the input field. each spoken set is appended to the expiration memory. you can choose from it phrases which are to be spoken again.</seg>

<seg id="2547">The Wortergänzung side contains a list of dictionaries for the word reproduction. in the main window next to the input field shows & kmouth; a selection field, if this list contains more than one dictionary. with this drop-down box, you can choose the currently used dictionary for word reproduction.</seg>
<seg id="2548">With buttons on the right of the page you can delete or add dictionaries, change the order of books or export them to a file. below the list, you can set the name and the dictionary in the input field the language for the dictionary.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Select the language you want for this source; & kmouth; then reads the & kde; documentation. the frequency of each word is simply evaluated by counting the occurrence. additionally, you can compare the wordlist using an OpenOffice.org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary.</seg>

<seg id="2553">In the lower part you can edit a selected entry. if you have selected a text passage, you can change the text passage or the associated shortcut. if you have selected a text passbook, you can only change its name.</seg>
<seg id="2554">Add actions such as new text passages or books, or delete selected text passages and books, either by selecting the menu bar, toolbar or pop-up menu.</seg>
<seg id="2555">The order of text passages or text passages can change by dragging with the mouse to the new position or with the arrow keys and the & Alt; button.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced capabilities of & ktops; for normal work with & ktops, filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Filters are processed in filters before being sent to the speech speech tool. they are useful for improving the pronunciation to replace false spoken words or abbreviations, select a suitable language and speaker or to deal with certain shortcomings of synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">"" "to understand the functioning of filters, it is important to know how the program" "" "speech-patcher" "" "works with a text." ""</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of Screen Readers has the highest priority. it will be withdrawn from all other orders and will hold these orders. if the output of the Screen-Reader is read, the retained orders will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important messages like & eg; Processor is subject to hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these assignments will resume after issue of warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the next highest priority. a message breaks normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you & eg; read a long text on a website, you can talk to & kmouth; someone who just enters the room. & kde; alerts are also messages. read this.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. each order that you initiate by the card card is a text order. KSayit is an example of an application that uses text applications. text applications are intended for the output of longer texts, which do not have any special urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queues except for the output of Screen readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktops; just one such preset, this issue will be halted and stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First, you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text messages as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters process the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future there can be even further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Strings replace parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & ktops; will be provided with predefined string placards, which enable the creation of chat-emoticons such as: -) by text or for reformatting messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better intelligible form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; converters use an XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from a format to another format. included in the scope of delivery; are some XSLT files to translate & XHTML; included in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With speaker selection filters, you can send assignments depending on the content of the text or depending on the program, which has sent the text to & ktops. for example, if you have set a female voice on the card card spokesman, you can read text from KDE messages about it. read Siehe.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters has adjustable rules, according to which it is applied to voice output. if the filter states that its rules are not true, it will pass the text unchanged to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text order, a message, warning or & kde; notification to & ktops; sent, it is processed by all activated filters that were set up on the page. editing through the filters is performed in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of normal filters. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and is not used. filter will be processed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter, and the following setup dialogs will be shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For setting string offset filters, you must type a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern. if these patterns are found in the text, then the text is exchanged for the equivalent replacement text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name, it only needs to be distinguished from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column match and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column ErSet. the list is processed in the order from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons, you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. load a list from a file, the entries from the file are attached to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is entered here, the filter is only applied if the spokesperson for the text order speaks one of the languages listed here. you can also select multiple languages if you press the & Ctrl key when you click the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter is only applied if the text is from one of the specified applications. you can enter multiple programs separately by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID running programs will get you with the program qdbus;. the & DBus; numbers have to leave you. if for example & qdbus; the application ID Kopet-3432 shows, you can only enter copete.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string offset filter is applied only to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Diesen Filter when matching. if all input fields are empty, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When comparing words, the string substitution filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s Word\\ s. so the words must be limited by separators (spaces) on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions. however, if you have installed the & kde; editor & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; expressions installed, you can use it in the dialogs add or edit as help to assemble these expressions. the & kde; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; expressions can be found in the package kdeutils.</seg>
<seg id="2649">XML; converters translate & XML; using XSLT files from a format to another format. XSLT (XML; Style Language - Transforms) is a W3C standard for such transformations. however, it can only be applied to well formed XML. the xsltproc utility needs to be installed on your system.</seg>
<seg id="2650">Enter the path for the xsltproc program. if xsltproc is accessible via the environment variable PATH, xsltproc is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2651">With the speaker selection filter, you can send text to a specific speaker that is set up on the card speaker, or to a speaker with specific features. for example, you can specify that text by kmail should be read by a female voice. see.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & ktops; gives a text to the filters, there is a spokesperson for the text. the speaker is selected based on the spokesperson properties, which specifies the text to & ktops; sends, and the features of the speaker designed on the card board speaker. with the speaker selection filter you can overwrite the selected spokesman.</seg>
<seg id="2653">If a value is entered here, the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression. is installed on your system of & kde; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; expressions installed, you can access it by clicking on the button to get help during input.</seg>
<seg id="2654">To achieve faster processing, you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e., start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Specify the properties of the speaker that you would like to use. if the text complies with the filter conditions shown above, the speaker is selected to meet the desired requirements. click on the button on the right to view the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Use these buttons to save or load your subscriber settings or delete all settings.</seg>

<seg id="2671">The synthesizers used by & ktops have their own license, which you can find in the related documentation or on the websites concerned. there are also voices which have their own license.</seg>
<seg id="2672">If you have access to the KDE source code archive, you can download the package with & ktops. you can also download it in the kttsd directory. in addition, you will find the source code from kdefraud under ftp: / / ftp.kde.org / pub / kde /.</seg>

<seg id="2675">KTTS works with any voice synthesizer, which can be started on the command line in a & console.</seg>
<seg id="2676">The list of the above languages may be incomplete or outdated. therefore, drag the description of the synthesizer to the supported languages. check also on the website of ktops;, for information not included in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2677">The speech tool "speech audicher" uses a customizable module architecture for voice synthesizers. if you want to expand & ktops for the use of another synthesizer, contact the developer team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The xsltproc utility is used for the support of SSML and for the & XML; but is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc with the apt-get install xsltproc command.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile & ktops, you need a current development environment of KDE (version 3.4 or later) including the packages kdelibs and the development files for the program "speech-dispatcher."</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you refer to the source text of & ktops; from the source code archive for kdefraud, or have downloaded the tarball current every night, compile and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you use & ktops, check first if speech audible is working properly with your voice synthesizer. you can use the shell script spd-conf to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktops; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of speech; the program kttmsgr should be developed in such a way that the set up of speech words is directly possible and the script spd-conf is no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is divided into individual sentences. the user can leave a sentence or paragraph, repeat, stop or abort output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If an application has text on & ktops, you can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for output. for example, if you have set up a speaker, whose language is English and whose sex is female, it is used otherwise the best fitting speaker will be selected. if you want to learn more about how & ktops; select a spokesperson, you will see them.</seg>
<seg id="2685">If you click Add-on to add a spokesman to the list or click Edit, the Map Editor Device will be displayed. for example, below is the setup of the module for Festival Interactive. details on the modules can be found below.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path to festival in PATH is included, you only have to enter a festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the encoding for text that is passed to festival. for voices, the & ktops; known, this setting is automatically made. generally, Western languages are using ISO 8859-1, Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">With these sliders you set the volume, speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you cannot select a few knobs and display this grey, the voice you selected does not allow these settings to be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices like MultiSyn-voices need to be loaded several seconds on account of their size. if you mark this check box, these voices are already loaded when starting KTTSD, so that the first movement is synthesized faster than the first set.</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you have not yet established a speaker (or to click Apply).</seg>

<seg id="2703">On this tab, you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority. & ktops; processes four types of language orders:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The output of Screen Readers has the highest priority. it will be withdrawn to all other orders and holds these orders. after the output of the Screen-Reader has been read, the retained orders are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next higher priority. this level is important news as & eg; Processor is subject to hot. a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text. these assignments will resume after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">News have the next priority. a message breaks normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that pronounces messages. if you leave & eg; just read a long text on a website, you can with & kmouth; nevertheless welcome someone who just enters the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text order is interrupted by a message, warning or output of a screen reader, adds & ktops; the audio output into the queue.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted. if both introductory sound and introductory message are active, the introductory sound is played before the introductory message.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this map are only valid for normal text orders. for messages, alerts and the output of Screen Readers, there are no special promotions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to highlight text for voice output. this standard contains trademarks for controlling voices, speaking speed, sound level, gender, voice and pitch.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently, & ktops; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following limitations exist:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the rab _ diphone voice (british male) as this is the standard voice used to use the festival in the output of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100nbsp;%, SSML text is usually spoken very monotonously.</seg>
<seg id="2726">&lt;! [CDATA [&lt;? XML version = "UTF-8"? &gt; &lt;! Doctype speak PUBLIC "- / / W3C / / DTD Synthesis 1.0 / / EN" "http: / / www.w3.org / TR / speech Mama Bär. who slept in my bed? asked Mama bear.]] &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and set limits filters (SDB filters). SBDs sign text into individual propositions. this allows & ktops to start earlier, since only the first set must be synthesized, not the entire text order.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the set limits filter. at the first start of & ktops, a set limit indicator filter is set up automatically as a default. you can change its settings or add additional set limits filters, but beginners will be advised.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The simplest way to set up the speaker selection by trying out. switch off the speaker selection and select text to read. switch the speaker selection again, change some properties and check how the choice of the speaker is changed. of course, you have to have more than one speaker set up, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktops; then start reading faster, since only the first sentence has to be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then pause or abort text messages on the map card, even if the language synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal typing indicator filter is set up automatically when you start kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, only removed. do not change anything at this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Set limits filters compare text with a regular expression for punctuation and add a tabulation sign (decimal code 8) to the set limits (tab characters are removed from the text automatically before filtering). note that the standard set limits filter preserves the character set.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never used on & kde; messages (kwarnings), warnings, messages, or output of Screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal set limits filter from failure, you can paste it again by loading the standard _ sbdrc file contained in & ktops.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the Map menu item selection, you can overwrite the subscriber settings for the application. the card card is displayed if</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the default speaker (the top on the card spokesman). in other words: no talk properties are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most appropriate speaker that has all the properties of a set-up speaker. if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker, select & ktops. otherwise choose & ktops; the speaker that is most likely to correspond to the original settings.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to input the desired subscriber properties by clicking on one of the buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the properties of the desired speaker here. if this property does not play any role, do not enter anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Select this check box if the property should have priority over other properties. you can also set several markers here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in issuing the issue, it is always treated as a priority property. you will rarely use this feature. the only case you possibly want to specify the attribute language is ahead if you know that a particular application sends text in another language than the one in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the features in the area of Speaker, which is most likely to be deleted, click on the Default Speaker and then use Speaker, which is most likely to follow the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case 0 is for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify a order number. (without order number, the input 0 is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr downstairs immediately when it is started. I compiled debug support, but I get no trace.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer has crashed and & ktops. probably you have to register GStreamer. GStreamer 0.8.x is the command gst-register-0.8. if the problem is not solved this may be a non-compatible version of GStreamer. you can try upgrading or uninstalling GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output via ALSA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application. if I get a text order, freeze & ktops; one. on the & console; appears a message that says: 'I to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system, the problem is that conflicts arise at ALSA, which prevent a simultaneous opening of several PCM devices. information for possible solutions can be found on the ALSA project website (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I have uploaded an additional voice for festival from the internet. I have installed it and can use it in the festival but ttsmgr does not show this voice.</seg>

<seg id="2751">On the audio card audio there is a setting speed. in order for this to work, the program must be installed sox and can be found on the environment variable PATH. some synthesizermoduls such as festival Interactive also offer a setting for speed on the map for subscriber units. depending on the selected voice, it is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the speech speed are ignored, if & ktops; & HTML; read. (this is because the HTML is converted into SSML.) Deactivate either the filter for conversion from & HTML; by & XML; (see) or, if you are quite courageous, change the .xsl file of & html; -after-SSML transformer filter, and set the speech speed up.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I do not manage to read websites with a female voice. I set up a female festival speaker but & ktops. read the websites with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95 beta, the day SABLE GENDER does not seem to work. so that festival does not produce any mistakes, the xsl file throws the Xsl file to convert SSML to Saber die GENDER-Tags. the same goes for VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added an own string setup filter and now I can go into & ktops; no more set up or go back. on the tab job is displayed, the order is only from one set. what do I do wrong?</seg>

<seg id="2759">Some users experience in connection with ALSA conflicts in the audio output. if your system counts, you cannot simultaneously play music and let a text read. & ktats; also freezes when you stop a text order and then start another. possible solutions for this problem can be found on the ALSA (dmix) website.</seg>
<seg id="2760">With Stand July 2005 aKode does not support any real breaks. if you stop a text order in & ktops, the current set will still be read.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The audio program sox is used for general setting of speaking speed, but otherwise it is not mandatory. Debian users can install sox with the apt-get install sox command. the program is included in most & Linux; CDs already included.</seg>
<seg id="2762">If you downloaded the tarball (with tar box archive), login as a normal user and unpack the tarball into a suitable folder. switch to this folder and enter the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2763">In & kde; 4 the module & arts; probably removed or produced at least on request.</seg>
<seg id="2764">The following modules for voice synthesizers are created by default. some of them own a run-time dependency of non-free software. (non-free according to the Debian distribution guidelines). the configure option of the configure option displays the configure parameter which causes the overpass of the depot.</seg>
<seg id="2765">As default, & ktops; installed in / opt / kde3. if this folder is not specified in the environment variable $KDEDIRS, you must specify the --prefix = target. for example</seg>

<seg id="2767">CD kdediv echo kttsd &gt; inst-apps make -f Makefile.cvs. / configure cd kttsd make su make install</seg>
<seg id="2768">Before you use & ktops, check first if your voice synthesizer works correctly. follow the instructions you have received with the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS Synthesizers whose source code is revealed. the quality of the voices is generally good and there are several voices and languages supported.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You must install at least one language. help with this you will find in the instructions provided with festival. if you want to read web pages, you must install the (male British) voice rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these voices you have to compile an extra module, so you need the source code of festival. the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The voice is still in an early stage of development. unpack the software in festival / lib / vocals / russian /. if you set up the Russian voices, you must enter the voices MSU _ ru _ NSH _ diphone. choose a Cyrillic (8-bit) encoding as for example KOI8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2773">Festival is usually included in the & Linux distributions. therefore, search for festival first on the CDs of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2774">If you want to use Polish, Hungarian or Czech language, the encoding option must be set to ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2775">If you want to use the Russian voice, the encoding option must be set to a 8-bit Cyrillic, such as KOI8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2776">Festival can be used together with the & MBROLA synthesizer. then, Festival takes over the lexical analysis and & MBROLA; generates the audio output. the & MBROLA; -program and the & MBROLA; -voices can be downloaded from</seg>
<seg id="2777">Note that & MBROLA; no full voice output system is. & MBROLA; generates language from Diphon files. you need additional software to create this diphone. Festival generates this by & MBROLA; required diphone. txt2pho can also produce diphone from German texts.</seg>
<seg id="2778">In this procedure, additional wrapper code will be added to the festival to use & MBROLA; note that the & MBROLA will not be installed in & MBROLA, but in the festival / lib /. manuals you will find under</seg>

<seg id="2795">FreeTTS is a free, quelloffener voice synthesizer, written in & Java, i.e. you need to install the & Java; Virtual Machine on your system. with & Java; you can set neither pitch, volume or speaking speed.</seg>
<seg id="2796">The command module allows you to use & ktops; with any voice synthesizer, which can be controlled in a & console; on the command line.</seg>
<seg id="2797">It is best to use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file (wav) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device.</seg>
<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter, which allows management of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a uniform, integrated interface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be accessed by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter.</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package was designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & kcontrolllcenter; create a simple interface for the user:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings in & kcontrolllcenter will be displayed. the network settings module (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolllcenter; Internet & network network settings in & KMenu.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to allow & knetworkconf; the device at all shows and allows setting of network features.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices will be installed and set up for network hardware and other devices. if network devices are added later, drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The network settings module is loaded when the network settings option is selected in the & kcontrolcenter; index. when starting the module network settings, this will automatically detect the platform used on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be detected, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to select which the distribution and release are best. by selecting the setting non-recurring issues, the definition can be made permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode. previously, all options are displayed gray, meaning the settings can only be viewed, changing is not possible. in system management mode, you can access system management mode at the right lower end of the module. it is required to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system management mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. it is divided into three tabs:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The Reiter Network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. from the Reiter Network interfaces, the following tasks can be performed:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings displayed on display can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface... set up in the device dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the Advanced Settings dialog displays the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The automatic mode calls the TCP / IP settings from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all required TCP / IP information for each system start, so no further setting is required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP, according to the system, can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the choice manual, without DHCP or BOOTP, the TCP / IP configuration can be made. in the IP address input field, the required TCP / IP address must be specified. in the input field network mask the subnet mask must be set.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface in boot. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the unit iste.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & console, you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off depending on the need. switching off a switched network device is enabled by selecting from the list and clicking the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched off depending on the need. off-off of an activated network device can be deactivated by selecting from the list and clicking the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the IP address of the computer in the local subnet, which transmits the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface must be selected to the network where the gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain attack by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the computer requests http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS dissolves this name to an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The host name resolution calculator allows easy management of this list. entries can be added, removed, or changed.</seg>
<seg id="2822">Clicking the button Add... from batch calculator to name resolution can be added to a DNS server. it will be added to the New nameserver dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry is then inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group calculator to the name resolution, select an entry and then click the Edit button.... It will appear the Edit dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list of names known by name describes computer name-to-IP address links for TCP / IP Subsystem. it is primarily used when no DNS servers are available. in small, closed networks it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Usually the list contains some known hosts some entries, the & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses. this still in the test version of IP should be replaced in the future version 4.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add.... The New Alias dialog will be added.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the known machine and click the Add button. if the known machine has several alias names, press the Add button several times and enter the other alias name.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a particular known machine from the list and select Edit.... The Modified Calculator dialog will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be performed one of the following tasks, then clicking OK will refresh the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the network settings are not immediately effective in the system. to enable the changes, it must be set in a & console; the following command must be set.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is sufficient when & kde; and Qt installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the ready-compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with a graphical interface such as a package or the installation tool of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case, the installation of Qt and & kde does not suffice; in addition, the development packages with libraries and other libraries are needed.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only by experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information is given on basic network technology, in the second section, all configuration files are discussed by & knetworkconf.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace previous knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information about the integration of the PC in a small (home) network is conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently, IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found widespread distribution. IPv6 expects that it is going through in the near future. therefore, this description is currently focussed on the common IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge of which IP address is attributable to a network interface. in foreign networks, at & eg; workstation, the network administrator is the contact person who has a valid IP address or, if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address cannot be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up a small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a field reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, so any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = the own machine). the standard route is required for the IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local one's own machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to an own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circuit.</seg>
<seg id="2848">This section contains the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes changed dynamically at DSL connections, so it will not be surprised if any other content in the event of active DSL connections can be found there.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE, it is known that this file is reassorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. another stand than expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar. it provides the ability to store multiple archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar which also provided dds2tar the ability of dds2tar for fast, selective packaging.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used it must be done by & kdat; it can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; howl back the tape and reads the clamp details of the tape. detects & kdat; when not on the tape, you will be asked if the tape is to be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detects & dat; the pre-spell, search for the appropriate index on your disk. if this is not found, you will be asked if the index is to be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">When everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was incorporated. in the status bar a corresponding message appears. the volume of the belt can now be searched by flaps of the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before throwing the belt, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; can be seen by changing the symbol for the tape, that the integration for the tape has been resolved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the tape can now be ejected without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape of & kdat; can be used it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band type must be formatted before you can be used to store data. this process does not correspond to formatting at & kdat;. if your tape drive needs to be formatted before use, this must happen before you can format the tape from & kdat; floppy disk drives usually do not require a formatting of the tape, DAT disks do not.</seg>

<seg id="2912">Right click in one of the archives and select the menu entry Check....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the checkout process is started, the dialog will appear for review. in this dialog you can review your selection and change the working folder for review.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for verification, the dialog will appear overchecking. this dialog displays the progress of the exam and the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can reproduce the restore, the files that should be recovered must be selected. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the entry for the tape drive. only the selected file or subfolder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select restore...</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process has been started, the dialog for restoration will appear. in this dialog you can review your selection and change the working folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the restore settings, the dialog will be restored. this dialog displays the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it is necessary to recreate the band indexed file using the band content. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can create the index on two types of tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder in which the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured will be updated automatically according to the chosen working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders listed under backup files, only the files located in the same file system are stored as the folder. folders that are located on other filesystems you can separate separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar independently from the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">This deletes the snapshot file before calling lintar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; lt; and lt; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can be set up using the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. the following settings can be done:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to the device node for tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding version of the belt device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">This setting is active, transmitted and kdat; before the tape embeds the command mt load to the drive. in some drives this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is switched on, try & kdat; lock the ejection during the tape drive. possibly, this setting does not work on all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, the tape is automatically ejected when releasing. do not use this option for floppy streaming.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is switched on, try & kdat; not all drives support variable block sizes. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you must notify & kdat; in any case the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a tape format, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only show one memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band ID. the format of this string is the machine name: seconds, where the name is the full name of the system on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds passed since the epoch in which the tape was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives that can be managed directly with & GNU; even other tar versions should work as long as it is not about incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup band. this symbol is only active if a tape is involved.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; viewer for system protocols. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system supports the various protocol files. moreover, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access for example to information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system registers the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog enables experienced users to quickly access information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore tries to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. this includes among other things:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the screenshot below, & ksystemlog; functions available with which the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can be easily filtered and sorted. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start try & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - is not displayed, and it opens up instead of a small news window, so you have & ksystemlog; very likely not started with system administrator rights. the protocol files are usually found in the directory / var / log, for the normal user usually no entitlement to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criterion or the input string. the list of the log lines is now automatically changed so that only log messages are displayed that match the selected filter. then a log line will only display the entry All. then a log line will only be displayed when in one of the columns the string of the filter searchword is included.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can of course select another entry at this point. for example, the string of the filter search term will only be compared to the entries in the column process, and in the filter bar, select the name of a process, so it shows you & ksystemlog; all log lines that were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of the level error are displayed with a more conspicuous color as a protocol-lines of the level indication. the colored representation of protocol lines can be turned off in a setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to display only certain process (e.g. in the system protocol or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the samba server start. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can switch the option to new rows in the main window's context menu, in order to display all the new protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org Dort you will find further up-to-date information on the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion repository: ksystemlog; im & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and also named in the following) as & ksysv;. this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init quickly became the standard for the control of program start-up of the system in the & Linux; world. and indeed because it is easier to use, more powerful and more flexible than traditional BSD inclusion.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further into historical aspects (because I know nothing about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone could attempt to make a machine on System V Init without reinstalling and reformatting. the & Linux; kernel looks first under / etc after an init file. that's why you must make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are located directly in / etc. this folder is named rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d includes a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for any system service that you want to start at the startup of the system or when switching to another run level. system services do not include such things such as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, however, does not include such things such as setserial, which is only launched once. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also use rc.serial to / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches for different places after the program init and starts the first one to find.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default run level is entered in / etc / inittab. in the starting area, you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look at the second column and probably notice that the default Runlevel 3 is 3. if you want to change this, then you can edit / etc / inittab manually and change the 3. if you have brought something through, then you will repair it by reboot the system and executing the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d, you will probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to any of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simply: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it is an argument as start and stop accepted. you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script is invoked with the argument stop. if it includes an S, the script will start with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; a server runlevel that can run only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. moreover, I could also have a user -Runlevel, das & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or other hand-held device is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run levels to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runleveln or change the position within a level by dragging it somewhere else. thereby, the entry is removed from its original Runlevel (or its position). this only happens if they pull out an entry from the area of availability system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved if you drag them into a new area. to simply copy them to a new Runlevel, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste it into the destination area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the sortiernumbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore records that were thrown into the trash. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tabulator button to activate the different working areas (available system services, runlevel 1 start, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry to another run level, move it with cutting to the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired run level with inserting (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or name of an entry manually, press the Enter key to switch the Properties dialog. use the Tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. defaults are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they are recovered by & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard Runners, and now the machine is constantly breaking new. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single-user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default run level to a reasonable value (3 should be normal).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for execution under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions simplifies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distributions but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution, please check if all configuration files are available that are required by the respective system service (and also if they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) are simply terminated without notice if their configuration files are not present or false.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of the & Linux; runway varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you are using a different distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that they can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation is based on & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter Adaptation by & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you need to save it. either use the corresponding icon of the toolbar or the Save in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two card cards, user and user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group with double click on the entry. it appears the user or group properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some card cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings. only if you have limited space restrictions (quota) for users, a card card will be created where you can configure individual settings. other cards appear if Shadow passwords are installed, for example / etc / master.passwd as in BSD installations.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The password management board appears if Shadow passwords are installed, for example / etc / master.passwd as in BSD installations.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card only appears if for at least a built-in filesystem space restriction (quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable at the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here, parameters can be changed for each user, with the restriction entries in KB are:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be individually set for each filesystem. the current file system is selected with the help of the field file system with space restriction.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The tab group provides information about the group affiliations of the selected user. the standard group to which the user belongs can be found in the Primary Group. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog properties of the group contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button of the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or group works analog.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO bootManager, add, remove and change the boot password, change the time to boot the standard operating system, remove the standard operating system, remove, modify operating systems, remove, modify and more.</seg>
