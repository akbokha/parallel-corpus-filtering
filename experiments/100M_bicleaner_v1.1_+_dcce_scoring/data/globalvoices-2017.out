although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordin@@ arily great .
like many of my generation , I have grown up with American movies , d@@ anced to American music , read American authors and operated his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was primarily a journalist because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican Brief , a fear@@ less rep@@ orter who covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspir@@ acy of a oil magn@@ ate with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were inclined to his interest .
I was caught .
free after Method One , &quot; I was like that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA had only intensi@@ fied .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country I have ever lived , whose diversity is so welcoming that you can always be the one you are and it &apos;s easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even had written a very tender love letter about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
a lot was written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his as@@ cen@@ sion is for me , how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
in his opinion he never holds behind the mountain , as is said so beautifully .
he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague , and publicly declares his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ amer@@ ica and women .
nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted in pairs for him .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can pres@@ election was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot@@ us person , I asked myself ?
I couldn &apos;t reconc@@ ile Tr@@ ump and his vot@@ ers to the people I had met during my time in Phoenix .
for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , which absor@@ bs people from all over the world , a deeply credi@@ ble person with whom I could talk about Islam and its past .
he did not agree with that of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I had met with our common love for basketball and we spent a lot of hours watching the &quot; Phoenix Suns . &quot;
Tr@@ umps &apos;s intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity that I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who spent their lives fighting the environment , and their husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like their son .
still it fits to the engagement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and my colleagues helped to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Leck@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors who helped me a lot in my career .
these people and those em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love of America .
while Tr@@ ump made its way to the nominated Republi@@ can pres@@ idency candidate , they offered me a stop and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America .
it turned out however that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , the pres@@ idency of a man , despite - or perhaps precisely because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the argument with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they either shared his rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things broke me almost the heart .
perhaps it is un@@ fair to describe the Tr@@ ump vot@@ ers as rac@@ ists .
to classi@@ fy people , one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is super@@ ficial and resp@@ ect@@ less and indicates in@@ ability to understand those who act and think differently .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their congregations are not taken into account .
could it be that those vot@@ ers , most of whom are white , have voted for Tr@@ ump because they want to reg@@ ain control of a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , they might want to say they are still important in this America ?
maybe .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comm@@ ent@@ ates the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look different from him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Ap@@ t. d . Ü . : as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; revol@@ t against all other ethnic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; pu@@ n of white in reference to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means as much as Sch@@ leu@@ der@@ trau@@ ma ) , as the great Van Jones called , has killed exactly what America has done so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which belief or background you may have , America welcomes everyone .
for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
however , with the election Donald Tr@@ umps , there is a vast majority of the white America of this promise and says : hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say .
in all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a rally for Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change in word with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; Mr. Khan asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried and their voices became lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could anyone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received an un@@ anim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded by saying : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , this is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the country for which his son fell , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ umps country , said the news .
and all the people that look like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

from mis@@ ery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish
the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; by Cat@@ eur@@ a , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca together with the children of the parag@@ ua@@ c city of Cat@@ eur@@ a ?
the music played in both places not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill site , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town which is very popular among tourists but worlds apart from the nearby pre@@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for several years now the La b@@ anda de m@@ ú@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) plays in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its abuse and abuse of gangs .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth such a rare hope forever .
the young band members take their obligations to the music group very seriously , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI writes :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
you always come laugh@@ ing and with shiny eyes and play in the bu@@ stle you learn day for day trumpet , tromb@@ one , pic@@ colo , clarinet , oboe , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , b@@ ong@@ os and the con@@ ga .
music from tr@@ ash
more than 7,@@ 000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a - a village that is practically at the top of the largest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ manufactured instruments made of local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ eur@@ a , where the recycl@@ ers under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez have started turning parts of the waste into instruments .
the instruments mim@@ ic viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion , all made out of the gar@@ bage .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music by the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc .
in an article in Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local win@@ emaker and music teacher of the children of Cat@@ eur@@ a , is remin@@ is@@ cent of the early days :
first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the gar@@ bage . the kids didn &apos;t know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed as a f@@ avi@@ o something he had never seen before : a violin made out of rub@@ b@@ ish .
today there is an orchestra consisting of instruments made of recycled material and which is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) shows the musical performance :
the world produces about one billion tons of waste every year .
those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - like people in Cat@@ eur@@ a , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
fill harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring scenery from gar@@ bage to music around the world .
the orchestra even played its music in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © FISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published by En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that pur@@ pos@@ efully reports on international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ publication is carried out as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the sharing of content .
in West Africa then it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liber@@ ian waters before it visited the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a criminal of these kinds to their co@@ asts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ es , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seych@@ elles were quickly mobili@@ sed against the ship . they refused to ap@@ point one of their ports and refused to grant him a fishing license .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior def@@ endant of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority , is part of a team that discovered and persec@@ uted the ship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there .
finally , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia due to lo@@ oting of the fish stocks of the country .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was FISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the NGO stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal F@@ ish@@ eries stop ) .
in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that had driven the prime minister from their waters at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like co@@ hesi@@ on and work together . they exchange information and stand out where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project provides FISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden so that it is extremely difficult to detect . this is the main cause of the over@@ fishing of regions .
due to the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , by which certain habit@@ ats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing once were ham@@ per@@ ed by bureaucr@@ atic hur@@ d@@ les , and also by the sn@@ ail @-@ emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , the actions happen in real @-@ time , with trac@@ eable on FISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news on susp@@ icious activities or details that one noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection .
fish @-@ i also pursu@@ es the activities of ships very carefully when they move on the open sea , by means of satellite data .
this allows the authorities to mark ships that fish in forbidden areas . also , such susp@@ icious travel routes can be discovered - such as those that suggest that a ship invites its caught fish on the move to other ships .
ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license , where they were on the move , and possibly also whether they have a criminal agent .
countries that are opposed to illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such vessels in their ports . what does that mean that ships cannot sell their cargo , and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then it &apos;s about substantial financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is not worthwhile anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , senior director of n@@ f@@ ds Africa . the latter is a consulting firm that advoc@@ ates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to gain an estimated $ 20 million in lost revenues , which the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network are losing each year because of the illegal fishermen who inv@@ ade East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish@@ eries which attract the region of commercial fishing from all over the world . among these illegal fis@@ her .
such actions include actions such as sailing under false flag , fal@@ si@@ fied license papers , st@@ ating fant@@ asi@@ es , fishing protected species and fish in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; pur@@ pos@@ efully exploit the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of an un@@ brid@@ led control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t want to start my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and exactly this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close FISH @-@ i now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far the closed front is working .
since its inc@@ eption , FISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 investigations of suspected ships .
it has revealed criminal networks that had distributed fal@@ si@@ fied licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has been prosec@@ uted and found escap@@ ing ships .
due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international agency for the fight against crime , FISH @-@ i can divide and receive information on illegal fishing over long distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that should help FISH @-@ i to detect susp@@ icious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps prevent the illegal ships that would like to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . and that &apos;s what we try to cross , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , boss analy@@ st at try@@ g@@ g Mat Tr@@ acking , a NGO that also deals with fish@@ eries data and offers FISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems , so that they can no longer be hosted by satell@@ ites .
Cop@@ eland thus helps build a system that connects different information levels . it should help FISH @-@ i to find crimin@@ ally acting ships with greater precision .
a model program
yet FISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently Sky@@ Truth launched the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Ocean Protection Organization Oc@@ e@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and is able to display the position of each tracking ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; join with the neigh@@ bors to get a better picture of who is doing - it simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to bund@@ le their resources . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust has a similar project that allows a global system to track ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that FISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect crimin@@ als but also sc@@ are them off .
ships that were previously exploited without a license and hardly had to reck@@ on with consequences now know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in FISH @-@ i have now recorded a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries turnover , since fishing boats have more licenses .
after FISH @-@ i had helped Somalia to detect Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found tow networks there , whose use was prohibited .
photo courtesy of FISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars are dis@@ appearing annually by illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 six countries have joined forces to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are also fighting the illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as FISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; with certainty , the aim is to allow even more such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , FISH @-@ i &apos;s latest member country Somalia was able to report its first great triumph : in October , it presented Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship running under false flag . and not only the ship was on the road even without a license and were used by drag@@ ging nets that are now prohibited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also in forbidden waters , reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for FISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special , collaborative way of working for the protection of the oceans actually works across the oceans . Emma Br@@ yce is a freel@@ ance journalist and lives in London . there she writes about the environment , technology and nutrition .
their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . location in Venezuela is further escal@@ ating : demonstrations in several cities with the aim to rec@@ ap@@ ture the country &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered to be a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the dismis@@ sal of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .
this picture of María Ale@@ j@@ andra Mor@@ a shows a close @-@ up of the demonstration in Marac@@ ai@@ bo in 2014 .

after the government of Venezuela had rejected the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , the Vene@@ tians re@@ acted in their eyes to negoti@@ ate the political and economic crisis of the country into the void of meeting the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( for example : the recovery of Venezuela ) , pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found .
the debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - among others in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the Andes regions of Méri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the central @-@ north of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the federal state Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country is steadily deteri@@ or@@ ating , which is noticeable in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute deficiency of food and drugs .
many representatives of the opposition saw a fundamental change in the official release of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but ultimately the post@@ ure of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Marianne D@@ í@@ az , contribut@@ or to Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ izes the context of the government decision as follows :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis in which inflation and profits are among the highest in the whole world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching short@@ age of food and medicine exists , the referendum was considered the only way to give the country a chance to reg@@ ain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the elec@@ toral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic unit ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces , the prot@@ esters called for a mass rally to support the National Assembly , and a march to Mi@@ ra@@ fl@@ ores palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government seat , was scheduled to continue on 3 November .
the call was commented on Twitter among other things as follows :
it is as far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nation@@ wide civil war and on 3 November all to Car@@ acas to Mi@@ ra@@ fl@@ ores palace .

&quot; the re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the first demonstration in the action programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , October 26 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the images of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify amongst other things an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also confront@@ ations with polic@@ emen and supporters of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most common images shows a prot@@ esters calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

particularly large waves struck the news about police re@@ pression in the central @-@ north of Marac@@ ay .
there the prot@@ esters went back to the local Cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement in front of the police and armed supporters of the government .
hours later they were able to leave the cathedral safely , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the state of T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not wear coats , because otherwise you could see something that many National Gu@@ ards do not have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic makes the round , which forms the amount of supp@@ ression per day :
thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country .
many representatives of the government had ques@@ tioned the validity of the demand for a minist@@ erial commission procedure - it has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of inn@@ um@@ erable people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs found :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of sig@@ natur@@ es are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your office !
on the road !
others evaluate these protests as a further step in the struggle against a government that has taken little against the devast@@ ating economic crisis and has preferred to con@@ front critical voices :
they took us so much - but also fear !
the mar@@ ches always increase in frequency and intensity .
some Vene@@ tians reported the media they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or shopping .

this is an adapted version of an interview of Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 at D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ inian news page .
the interview was translated into English and published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian town of Córdoba .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano testi@@ fied at the great La Per@@ la Ribera Process in the province of Cordoba against his father .
in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship were investigated .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
starting with the brush , carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in the prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he retained the secret of family secrets .
in the situation at that time I believed that was fine .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child of 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not see that my father was a th@@ ief , tort@@ urer and mur@@ derer .
Luis has no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ arm@@ eri@@ ebe@@ am@@ ter . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was Deputy commander of the secret service department 141 in prison La Per@@ la .

therefore he charged me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would become a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . because so my father had educated me .
on the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard of the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : University degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ When the prisoners are tort@@ ured , the prisoners are tort@@ ured . &apos;
my father took me a total of four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible - stood .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small package wrapped in a blank@@ et and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver in it .
on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the stolen objects were stopped and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tort@@ ured .
I went in and saw a couch that people were tort@@ ured .
she looked like a camp bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they fast@@ ened the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person , which was just enc@@ ir@@ cl@@ ed there .
she seldom bin@@ ds a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured it with water and hun@@ ted him with a charge of 220 volts to the gen@@ it@@ als .

the tank there inside was horri@@ ble ... like a dirty wind .
years later when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I realized the smell instantly and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much suffering to another person ?
&apos;@@ I knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where prisoners were bound with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were wor@@ shipped .
he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also accused of the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were lying down with the face down - all were tied at hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance , people kept quiet on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you think , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pseud@@ om@@ ugi@@ l c@@ f. p@@ ask@@ ai &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; red ne@@ on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Biot@@ op einrichten &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know that because my father told me at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero put a man together there and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to indications of survi@@ vor@@ s of the Zi@@ vi@@ list Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in La Per@@ la @-@ Ribera trial , the student Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video Emi@@ lio F@@ essi@@ a , the director of the memorial La Per@@ la , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came in here is also the way on which the kid@@ n@@ apped came here .
when you look at the map , you see that they took about this route and then were tort@@ ured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they got a number assigned as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from the top came that they should be laid .
this was the lie - Eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the dis@@ appearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; war mare &apos;
my father brought home all sorts of stolen things .
at that time at the age I had no idea what the &quot; war mare &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was later on the military , I was in G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war @-@ horses are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military bad@@ ges that are taken away from an enemy that was fought .

but if one goes to a house and the fridge , the record player , clothing , painting , money ... ste@@ als , then this is not a war mare but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wonder@@ ed how my father , the leader of security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer in G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and ste@@ al everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal , and I answered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you , who you see cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded with anger , struck me and cried :
if you go so far , then I will find you and kill you .
we don &apos;t need anybody else to do this !
so my father was .
I have not a single good memory of him .
when I said in the trial , I showed a photo of that time , on which I had a jacket and a roller co@@ ater made of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor but he still brought clothes with home .
at that time , the defense accused me of being a co @-@ conspir@@ ator with this crime . I answered , no problem , they can lay down on what they wanted .
I was there anyway to testify .
&apos;@@ The dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ p@@ ses is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &apos;
now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . if one has only children , one recogni@@ zes the value of a life .
one develops further and recogni@@ zes that it is false to kill .
I went even so far to say :
well , you have executed people during the dictatorship , but why do the cor@@ p@@ ses leave ?
why children are kid@@ n@@ apped ?
one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself : they were tort@@ ured , but why were they killed ?
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Sc@@ ene Inv@@ estig@@ ation ( TV )
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why do their bodies disappear ?
did these people not also have families to whom to pass their mort@@ al remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ p@@ ses is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that one can do to a man .
my father told me when the democracy was re@@ inst@@ ated , they hol@@ lowed machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were grin@@ ded and dispos@@ ed of - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you &apos;ll never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but , of course , something remains .
&apos;@@ I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to clarify it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
the thought of showing my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made him accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities I had to witness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked myself why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they suppos@@ edly def@@ ended were actually good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me ?
I saw how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes , and you have forced me as a child to take part in it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he rep@@ lied only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well done &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I first started the first ad .
I had finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can repro@@ ach me that I am pre@@ occupied . I finally declared against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died under house arrest in May 2015 still before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 416 crimes : under severe , un@@ lawful prison sentence in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture followed by subsequent death in five cases and a case of kid@@ n@@ apping of one under 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .

the judgments of the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the magn@@ itude of the judgment in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historical La Per@@ la @-@ Ribera trial ended in August 1975 and December 1978 crimes against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August .
43 op@@ press@@ ors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court suspended imprisonment and in nine cases of sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases there were absol@@ utes .
eleven of the original 54 def@@ endants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ Show : murder , torture and rape by minist@@ erial staff . # Es@@ hot state terrorism
all the def@@ endants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police and civilian employees .
Pier@@ o De Monti was kid@@ n@@ apped together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by un@@ human heads .
the Court of Justice is a historical milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on justice for victims .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the attor@@ ney of the Argent@@ inian organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who represents the children of people who were murdered during the dictatorship , said :
the process took more than three years , but research for it took 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government delivered the land on which La Per@@ la was located so that there could be a memorial there , which is now led by human rights organizations .

a translation error makes elderly people in Ky@@ oto about &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a center in Ky@@ oto , where you can pro@@ long your driver &apos;s license .
the photo was spread in the social media .
adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Ky@@ oto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can pro@@ long their driver &apos;s license , in the last month witnesses of a particularly mis@@ diagnosed translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a sign the Japanese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dried mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( kor@@ ean ) , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; w@@ ron@@ g@@ ly fal@@ sely - perhaps also with mal@@ icious thoughts &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; translated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful mot@@ orists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself from 1st to 20th September .
adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was widely shared in the social media .
the fault happened to the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the daily Ky@@ oto Shi@@ m@@ bu@@ n newspaper , published in Ky@@ oto , wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city like Ky@@ oto simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was first removed . the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; el@@ der drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; designation ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ky@@ oto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for translation errors . furthermore , it stated that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its correctness before it was published .
a blo@@ gger told me about the exc@@ use :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sincer@@ ely sorry that elderly people felt off@@ ended by the in@@ adequate correction ( the translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News focused somewhat more detail with the phenomenon of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elderly mot@@ orists in Japan and wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot;
the word &quot; terrible &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of elderly mot@@ orists who are involved nation@@ wide in accidents is a reason to concern .
in the Ky@@ oto pre@@ f@@ ecture , in 2005 , 1,9@@ 41 were caused by a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents of sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors created 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the share of the inci@@ dents caused by senior citizens has risen in the same period .
the named rep@@ orter brought comments on the light in the version of the article published on Yahoo , showing what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seem to how@@ l against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo about the translation error has , among other things , the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; ) not the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How defective is the translation actually not at all , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that is a true translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why En@@ gr@@ ish is so widespread all over Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizar@@ re mistakes in English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
for transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the starting text and active language skills to transfer it into the target language .
the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that trans@@ lators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their native language , who could make translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons or relatively small number of native speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies that do not have foreign employees do not allow translations to be produced in @-@ house . then , the Japanese staff , whose English skills are considered the best , are made to trans@@ lators - no matter how good or bad their language skills really are .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widespread - often with funny results .
the confused and mysterious phrases that arise by machine translations show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time . this applies to some languages very special .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , among them also the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints , which often decor@@ ate t @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or understood .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable as an ornam@@ ent or at least harm@@ less . however , from large companies or government that have the means to guarantee higher standards , you can expect more thorough translations .
in the future , the city of Ky@@ oto will hopefully use a more serious source of translation .
Venezuela : to participate in protests and security measures on the internet and on TV
main page of the &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; portal ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users registered that they had no access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online channel .
later , other users wrote that the internet sites of V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible .
other online broad@@ cast@@ ers also took photographs of the protests in Car@@ acas , organized by opposition groups , resist@@ ing the government of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
the protests began in early April after the Supreme Court dis@@ b@@ anded the Parliament and handed over the parliamentary tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Trac@@ er@@ ou@@ te . he pointed out that the connection was c@@ apped , and recommended the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# Zen@@ sur : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that web pages Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are again locked .
this is from the site of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among the Vene@@ tians with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been rel@@ uc@@ t@@ ant to report protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ation threatened them with fin@@ es and lock@@ ings , if they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission watched this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again .
aston@@ ishing that this is still cheaper than buying two liters of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO , VE@@ GA , later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly carries out its meetings .
previous research conducted by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS servers respond badly requests of certain domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds faul@@ ty or ref@@ uses the request when calling this website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third locked channel , the transmission was set on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V cam@@ eram@@ an El@@ vis Flores , who transferred the protests in Car@@ acas live , was det@@ ained .
Flores was beaten while he was in police custo@@ dy .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went back to broadcast .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections , making it more difficult for the Venezu@@ el@@ ans to access multimedia reports on current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to get education
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today , Tina is fighting for children &apos;s rights and g@@ athers testimon@@ ies of other Cri@@ adi@@ tas , as they are victims of abuse and discrimination .
photo of Ceci@@ lia Ro@@ jas . use with kind permission of cur@@ ator .
the following article is the short@@ ened version of a cur@@ ator report published by Global Vo@@ ices with friendly permission of the authors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ elas que ca@@ en &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is edited and re @-@ released by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ tas , one calls for more than 46,@@ 000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a big family with little money sur@@ passes her minor son or her under@@ age daughter to another family . in exchange , the child receives food , training and a roof above the head .
what is not mentioned , however , is that the children will have to pay hom@@ ew@@ ork for it , which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted .
this practice , called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organizations .
after completing her studies Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls .
she talked with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collecting testimon@@ ies , resear@@ ching and pran@@ cing .
she tried to call things by name , because the feeling of gratitude which is vacc@@ inated for the Cri@@ adi@@ tas is generally guaranteed to remain silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is , on the one hand , the family who have their daughter in the belief that they can develop their education , improve their position in society and &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; to another family .
on the other hand , the family , who takes the girl with herself and justi@@ fies its exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and perhaps even star@@ ved .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is ab@@ used , his family will learn about it many years later .
sometimes they never experience it .
in January 2016 there was a relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in sec@@ rec@@ y in par@@ agu@@ an households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín had come to the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of heavy b@@ lows . shortly after she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military company Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who worked as an official at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their home in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with just 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra climb@@ ed up to Mar@@ ín with a stick until it suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported about the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society responsible for the death of the girl .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no other Carolina &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay would be allowed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; says Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents , it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neigh@@ bors of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a rapid examination of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to murder the girl who was their Cri@@ adi@@ ta , sentenced to 30 years in prison .
when the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín may be a trend @-@ setting - for the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go to court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as labour forces , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ pe where her father worked , had to register bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy and her father lost his work .
their brothers had to go all work and started selling cand@@ y on the street or on the market to earn money .
but they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of their employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
she had to share the time so that she still had time to learn .
they rose up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employers .
Fri@@ days , for example , cleaned the fridge , pl@@ ast@@ ered the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn .
the more she was ready with learning , the more free time she had .
but even this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says , she never had to star@@ ve , but was not in@@ definitely food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I needed more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she rec@@ alls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iser of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a Liber@@ al Party , which during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 , belonged to the opposition .
at some ends the bud@@ get@@ ary Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced him to stand alongside him and read editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sender@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pueblo . &quot;
he tried to convince them , to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he thought she was intelligent , but did not stick with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the landlord had found someone who listened while he spoke about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family because they believed that I would learn there again &quot; bad habits . &quot; that meant that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belonged to the Indi@@ genous group of Guar@@ an@@ í , would again speak their mother tongue Guar@@ an@@ í .
their Lord feared that they would lose the formation that they enabled her to lose , she explains .
she was completely clear , however , that she had paid for everything she got from them , with her hard work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was also discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing about which almost never is spoken are mo@@ b@@ bing and the sham@@ ans exposed to cri@@ adi@@ tas when they go to school . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to me home . I had no circle of friends in the school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly noticeable that I belong to no group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
society endor@@ ses the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , where you can share job adverti@@ sements for cleaning staff and nur@@ ses in Paraguay .
the group administrator is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ anov@@ sky , a city coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district .
Hi ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter , who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please contact you .
starting from Monday if possible .
the ad received five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she would have a eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman , who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the third comment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the inland that wants to work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was written . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the authors of the display switched themselves once again :
dear friends , I found one . I see if it works with it .
thank you , I write again if something is .
the business was complete .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report cri@@ adi@@ tas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( cri@@ adi@@ tas , how long ? ) , a collection of witness reports of former Cri@@ adi@@ tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history , we have managed to aboli@@ sh systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay ) , the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the women of the Guar@@ an@@ í , and the system of Men@@ s@@ ú ( where the workers were given tribute to them ) and the system of Men@@ s@@ ú ( where the workers were given tribute to them ) , and the system of Men@@ s@@ ú ( where the workers were given tribute to them ) , with which they become light victims of abuse and exploitation .
social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the showing of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
draft legislation dict@@ ates social media to Egyptian people to register with the government

&quot; &quot; &quot; six@@ ty Egyptian parliament@@ arians recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the regul@@ ators in terms of use and utility social networks &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it is accepted by the Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt at a government office in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be established , which is in charge of making citizens a permit to share social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the adoption of the law , users would have to register on the site with their right names and identity card numbers in order to be able to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , this could result in a penalty of up to six months &quot; imprisonment or a fine of money .
the bill , consisting of six paragrap@@ hs and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application , which runs over the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice , video alignment and text . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how the law is en@@ forced when it is accepted , as the draft does not give an indication of how Egyptian authorities are supposed to impose the registration . un@@ clear is also how they should make up those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to guarantee regulation at the level of social media companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ du@@ l Satt@@ ar , Member of Parliament and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a username and password from the telecommunications department &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to establish a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of them it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information to their identity in order to access the network .
but it is not known so far that such plans exist .
experts on the spot are scep@@ tical about the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y R@@ ao@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; senior research techn@@ ologist &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Human Rights ( EI@@ PR , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative für Personal Rights &quot; ) , &quot; Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt the technical capacity and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they control violent physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I take them seriously , that means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who request permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor human activities and also to bring them to a court process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is technically by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be passed as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the Parliament &apos;s legisl@@ ature and constitutional committees before it goes to the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in the parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the picture surface , &quot; says R@@ ao@@ of .
last year , the parliamentary majority of Tam@@ er El @-@ Sh@@ ah@@ aw@@ y proposed a legal action against cy@@ ber crime , in which a li@@ fel@@ ong prison sentence was en@@ vis@@ aged for those found guilty of threatening &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;

high up in the mountains of Kur@@ dist@@ an in the northeast of Iraq , the Animal Gu@@ ards H@@ ana Ah@@ med R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the Non @-@ Govern@@ mental Organization of Nature Iraq are working to protect the Vul@@ gar Persi@@ an Leopard .
a sub@@ type of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards that strike through Africa and Asia belong to the Persi@@ an Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sa@@ ic@@ olor ) . altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Con@@ servation of Nature .
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
as R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; The Persi@@ an Leopard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kur@@ dish ecos@@ ystem , &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecos@@ ystem also depends on a large pre@@ dat@@ or .
the chance to see a Persi@@ an Leopard in the free wilderness is low and goes against zero . when the team in the video proves that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera , R@@ aza breaks in pure joy .
as a trained bi@@ ologist , R@@ aza passi@@ on@@ ately likes to passi@@ on@@ ately reveal another side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .

at the beginning of March 2017 , the daily Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o daily , responsible for North @-@ East Japan , was the progress achieved over the last six years to re@@ build the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple @-@ cat@@ astrophe &quot; from March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma triggered the cat@@ astrophe .
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Send@@ ai , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture was a great pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate have been for@@ ci@@ bly evacu@@ ated , as the ts@@ un@@ ami had left whole coastal cities disappear from the map .
the pre@@ f@@ ecture Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma still experienced a nuclear accident , already alone , therefore , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o shows from the local point of view that progress has been achieved six years later in order to re@@ build the lives of local residents .
the report also contains descriptions of the leading players including key financial met@@ rics and analysis of competitive pressures within the market .
the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that by December 2015 , 77 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to record the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , 80 per cent of the planned replacement buildings were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 per cent of such buildings , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light with 70 percent .
at the same time , one still tries to surround the final replacement houses six years after the cat@@ astrophe , evacu@@ ated by accommodation shel@@ ters ( precau@@ tion custo@@ dy , kas@@ ets@@ u ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) .
after the three @-@ fold cat@@ astrophe nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such homes .
almost 40 percent of the evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 are still living in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful on this occasion . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ees , which were hau@@ gh@@ ed after the disaster in Beh@@ el@@ sen shel@@ ters , were res@@ ett@@ led into final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure is 34 percent .
the stand of works and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
as the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper could determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools affected by mis@@ fortune , opened its doors until December 2016 , which almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while almost 100 percent of fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of fishing ports have res@@ umed their operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident occurred in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land large @-@ scale .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident , as only 690 ac@@ res of 5 400 hectares of farm@@ land from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are located in the nuclear black@@ zone .
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma stays far away .
the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent on the same level as before the mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can have only 75 percent .
however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the cat@@ astrophe almost half of the coastal dwell@@ ers , it is more difficult to earn their living .
is the indigenous population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to find out an overall picture , the paper led numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacu@@ ees . she asked them about the state of re@@ building and how their emp@@ athy has changed over the ts@@ un@@ ami @-@ risk .
in her introduction of the article , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the indigenous population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
how it stands for those who had to evacu@@ ate Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
in her issue of the anniversary of the earthquake , Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung also focused her attention on the situation of the evacu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to witness not only the powerful earthquake and devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma &apos;s pre@@ f@@ ecture was also witness to the worst , disaster @-@ causing nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed .
from 160 000 evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63 000 people were displac@@ ed in areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 there were more than 23@@ 0,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , converted into permanent replacement dwell@@ ings .
after the 2017 stand , 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma live outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the disaster areas , most of the evacu@@ ees who are still in Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ bas@@ is@@ hausen are older than 50 years old . they are well known because the efforts to re@@ build Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive building projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games which will take place in Tokyo by 2020 .
die Welt ist klein : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people meet people from other countries who speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities .
but after a while one often det@@ ects that one more connects than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we are watching these global ties . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we cover topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected to someone about language and country boundaries .

Brasi@@ lian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after being beaten by the police in nation@@ wide demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Luz . publication with permission .
rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva on a widespread picture .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was included in the intensive care unit this week : last Friday a police officer had struck him during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a head@@ stock . nation@@ wide millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who studies social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated him on this Saturday and now transferred him into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus who spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
in the pictures , the face of the police officer could also recognize who attacked with a stick . the man was identified as Augu@@ sto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the Military Police was announced in the Brazilian federal state of Go@@ i@@ ás that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the end of the investigation of the incident from the active ministry .
the pictures show the police officers , as he embar@@ ked on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
if a police officer would be beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and land on the intensive ward , his face would be on TV for six months and the entire supp@@ ression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ nov@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video taken by Lu@@ iz da Luz on the net in which you see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several medi@@ cs will ha@@ sten to it shortly afterwards .
another video with the same scenes , but fil@@ med from a different perspective , is also seen in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus who lives in another federal state , Internet users meanwhile donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans ( about 2,@@ 700 Euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to enable his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , while he is in hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .

the drawing has been shared multiple times in social networks .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás has experienced a wave of political violence : here , the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was murdered by his father because he has sab@@ ot@@ aged the Occ@@ up@@ y movement in secondary schools . here , the military police had been sab@@ ot@@ aged by a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App group , and here a busy school was sab@@ ot@@ aged with a gas le@@ ck .
police attacked by police
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , where there was a brutal police action against demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
polic@@ emen were in protests in the centre of Rio de Jan@@ eiro , where demonstr@@ ators established a stage for speakers , rubber floor tiles and tear gas .
the dep@@ uty Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SOL ) , asked the police to ren@@ ounce violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announ@@ cements .
this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country .
once again the Brazilian media have tu@@ cked street protests by direc@@ ting the focus on another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported specifically about a broken glass window in order to design their front pages illustr@@ atively with a photo .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o fav@@ oured a cover story with a brand set on fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journalist reason to report more about a broken glass window than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special cause .
this must also be recognized if one is strictly against any kind of damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here too , the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets an absurd , disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate meaning , and the typical acts of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demonstr@@ ators on confront@@ ation course with the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the villages forgotten by the de@@ indu@@ str@@ alization in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in all of Cuba opened its doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the Western Cub@@ an province of May@@ abe@@ za , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - regardless of the fact that there is no known sugar harvest on site .
it was two years ago when the activities were paraly@@ sed in the sugar cane factories .
after the rise , the sugar cane industry was standing still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding was left out of steel and concrete .
about 272 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some rarely change the job .
others res@@ igned and comm@@ ute daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a veter@@ an veter@@ an , who rises every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not screw@@ ed its sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which are in operation after a long in@@ active time , because they were received .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene rec@@ alls to have heard exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich I would get the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry already resist@@ s pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the amount produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a motive for concern for the country some decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no longer a new thing .
why was the Cub@@ an sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old path of the church already saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive they became un@@ sustainable for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes .
they only left factories that can produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price increased about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar@@ s must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report published by the OECD and FA@@ O , the United Nations Agri@@ cultural and Food Organisation .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate circa € 85 million for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first words of Cub@@ an President Fi@@ del Castro were in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o during his speech on 21 October 2002 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry .
in the following years , the shut@@ down of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people , received their full sal@@ aries for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if N@@ ene , how he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closing of the factory , is the word he repe@@ ats most , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sc@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all ques@@ tioned are of the same opinion : not one of them informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first year of closing , the first letters began to come .
it was officially recorded documents , which would only be distinguished from the parts that would be removed , addressing the addres@@ see and the date .
all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on the responsibility was taken over and the letters were getting more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the quiet factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories in operation , &quot; he affir@@ med .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , is waiting for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved against his will at the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction he helped .
with every part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 years of work .
the most developed industry area of Cuba and the most important work@@ at@@ zer@@ ists was ext@@ ingu@@ ished .
in many cases , there were no alternatives to the jobs and services that the systems generated in the congregations in which they were found .
we will never know if during the mam@@ mot@@ h speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then president saw in the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closing of the sugar cane factories
since 2004 , sugar cane is extracted only highly by grinding .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years the community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said than they began to medit@@ ate on it , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ e the road , this dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to seek other factories .
they became spare parts .
without prospects for the future , many young people left the region .
in the area a food factory was created , whose production does not even serve to supply the church .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still imposing .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory of Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
n@@ in@@ ety @-@ nine Ear@@ nings lead the old soldier a pension of two thousand p@@ eso per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a night @-@ bearing person , yet he for@@ gives the lies that one told him , not .
they have been tort@@ uring him for ten years .
N@@ ene goes into pension with 65 years , not because it is lacking in power , but because he is bit@@ tered .

first Nations Youth use Hip @-@ Hop to express yourself and get your own culture
&quot; &quot; &quot; recording a song from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Home to Me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo used with permission of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
teen@@ agers of the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them . they do this by means of hip @-@ hop , thanks to a series of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach young groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were conducted by the educ@@ ator David Hod@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and worked together in North Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then collabor@@ ated with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop group The North@@ Star .
the workshop is thus increasing that the young participants in discussions arise like &quot; cultural identity , language , conflict , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes into mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the US state Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called Highway of T@@ ears , a street stage in western Canada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered .
the cases were largely un@@ solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ aska Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs is despite the influence of glob@@ alization .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the yo@@ ung@@ sters don &apos;t always domin@@ ate the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the ref@@ rain is sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North@@ star Hip @-@ Hop Group , who gave them a verse in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the verse is available in tran@@ scription , as well a translation into English , which is translated here into German :
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to go on my days on earth
that is the day you will take our scre@@ am
because we lost our way in life as a youth
but I believe we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how to live a bad life
so they can grow and go ahead of our youth
this is how they can do what they intended for the creator .
in the commentary part , the reader and pro@@ ponent of the Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the verse in sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ es ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant in Japan

in Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , near the entrance sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( &quot; Plas@@ tische Modelle der Küche &quot; ) is displayed by any dish that is served in this restaurant .
customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is an entire industry dedicated to the production of these plastic courts .
in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi there is a variety of these small companies that produce just those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so usually that they do not even notice them any more . however , a new trend is today transformed into show@@ y mobile phone accessories and other gad@@ gets .
Na@@ ver Mat@@ oma published the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new with plastic courts decorated cell @-@ rib@@ b@@ ons as they are shown at K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu &apos;s department store .
many of these artificial foods have been turned to kit@@ sch@@ y collec@@ ti@@ bles , as in this case , refrigerator magn@@ ets :
here are some sho@@ ku@@ hin c@@ rank@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo station .
the new boom in the essenti@@ als is becoming increasingly more complex .
in this case , a k@@ ais@@ en @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) turned into a mobile stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lol ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
we have also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
some mobile stand and mobile designers allow you to make your own work of art . in this case IK@@ URA or salmon roe is used , a popular t@@ opping served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there anyone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; w@@ ow , cool , now I can decor@@ ate my mobile phone with laugh@@ ing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;ll probably be the only one .
this interest in plastic courses can also take a less appeti@@ zing form to surprise colleagues or family members un@@ comfortable .
our latest mobile stand has the shape of mel@@ ted ice .
in addition , there are also rice @-@ balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands made of dried salmon .
you can view more bizar@@ re plastic courts at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag #
if you would like to learn more about the origins of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , dedicated to the establishment of the restaurant industry . for example , with the sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survi@@ vor@@ s of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports in domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug traff@@ icking &quot; in Mexico , the mis@@ si@@ les and drinks regularly appear in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human trag@@ edy which this struggle brings .
the report on drugs bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the leader of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , urged the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background .
on the day after a violent incident , no one looks at the ber@@ e@@ av@@ ed or the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
behind every body , behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret tren@@ ches , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed .
for this reason , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; ap@@ render a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with drug traff@@ icking &quot; ) that will give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were caught up in the fight between the law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project as follows :
organized crime can not only be feared by our lives .
the impact is much more profound .
for example , when businesses close , because they are threatened by drug dealers and therefore have to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
a video called &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian por el mi@@ edo &quot; ( English : &quot; how fear lives &quot; ) tells the story .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father looking for secret tom@@ bs after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two ne@@ ph@@ ews on just one day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again today for the task which we have asked ourselves to go and to gra@@ ves , according to the people we have loved to seek . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13 he left the house .
on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came back . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me because I am alone with three children who need training .
there is also my mother , who is here with me .
at the moment she has no income .
you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but she doesn &apos;t get it out , because they require a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get that ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; ap@@ render a vi@@ vir con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership .
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have been familiar with disease and sens@@ ation@@ journ@@ alism for several years now .
every day I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the cover pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from acts of specialists .
it brings me out of the frame .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be indiffer@@ ent to this or consider it as normal .
she continues to write :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) when it &apos;s big . and it &apos;s also not normal that people listen to songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they walk through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them .
I see our weakness if stories become mere numbers in a stati@@ stic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified by the fact that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; settled &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they try to talk that they remain spar@@ ed by such trag@@ e@@ dies when they are not stir@@ ring and quiet .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; Four months of black@@ mail in the capital district : how a family has been lo@@ oted by threats . &quot; it describes how armed crimin@@ als presses money from their business for month , until they end not only destroyed the business , but also torn their family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can change your entire life in just a few days .
the pain of this never passes , the trau@@ ma stays , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact you if it is absolutely necessary .
the more we are from each other , the better .
she included her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when to kid@@ n@@ ap or kill you .
I asked myself in these terrible days if cry would dis@@ solve my deep rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I for@@ got how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who car@@ es about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them .
Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , make potatoes , tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for whom life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years before , when he was only a few blocks away from his home , who saw the bloody mis@@ ery of his father , who was shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence caused by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the citizen &apos;s council for public security and government of the Government of the United States .
only in 2010 the public prosec@@ utor called 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 Mor@@ des per day .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of tales that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate them into the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; ap@@ render a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico 2015 initiated the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim is to present the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug traff@@ icking , which has tort@@ ured the country over the last four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
sharing is Car@@ ing from Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) WAR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages to which it links , contain pictures on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or un@@ mask a f@@ ake .
but how is the year after something that &apos;s first appeared ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first publication , it has been mis@@ leading to depic@@ t trag@@ e@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this false coupling of image and event - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrong description &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrong context &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there are plenty of careful coverage of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for images to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 a tank truck crossed the town of San@@ ge in the east of the DR Congo , ti@@ pping around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglec@@ ted for years and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become dangerous trails full of poth@@ oles which were difficult to drive .
trag@@ ically , the tank truck fell victim to it .
the representative describes a fire@@ ball that wrapped dozens of houses including a cinem@@ as nearby , which was full of people who were watching the soccer world championship .
houses burned and char@@ red cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burnt to the in@@ determin@@ at@@ eness .
a picture with the title &quot; Das ist Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ User My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the horri@@ ble scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of stolen bodies that are str@@ ung on the ground while watching them .
but here the story does not come to its end .
over the years , the same photo has been printed several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms and mis@@ understand@@ ably attributed to real but not related trag@@ e@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened not in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 fighters of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an towns of B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
ey@@ e@@ witnesses reported dr@@ astic atro@@ cities in which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and b@@ ushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one stayed behind to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a people to Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many had been sh@@ attered , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be presented figur@@ atively .
the reason for the attack remained un@@ resolved , but the military point in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt by Bo@@ ko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerged from the DR Congo , as it was mistakenly presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massac@@ re of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ usive use of the DR Congo is only one in a number of mis@@ concep@@ tions ; Africa check has documented orders to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the image was presented as evidence of mass kill@@ ings .
one step further forward personal comments such as this example mistakenly uses the DR Congo with sources of the mass media in order to provide arguments .
the image of San@@ ge also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a lightning sign , released by the United Nations describes those who were able to flee b@@ lows , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported about the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts such as the following , which brought these descriptions together with photos from DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news site , which report@@ edly claimed , the president of Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ ein , said , monks and politicians had participated in the assass@@ ination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , they had used the image from DR Congo to view this information .
the original article , which was accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organisations called AF@@ P as their source had also mistakenly attributed to Th@@ ein Sein &apos;s statement , but had not related the picture taken from the DR Congo .
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these false cap@@ tions go back to the years 2011 and 2012 and come from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse image search &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found under 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of 3 May 2017 ) 344 images that are very similar to the said picture from DR Congo .
they come from a mix of private sites , platforms social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have re@@ directed false reports , some have tried to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have bor@@ row@@ ed examples of ab@@ usive use and linked them to the respective countries on the basis of which they had been published on which side they were published .
the countries listed below ( which were also linked to each other in some cases ) may have several examples of ab@@ usive use .
here are some cases which can now be sp@@ oked completely ( on the map in orange ) :

as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .

this post , addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly states that the picture of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar has granted Th@@ ein Sein 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in killing the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of San@@ ge .
the article was updated in 2014 and the picture remains in it at the time of this release .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students who had been killed by Bo@@ ko Har@@ am , published by the recent news page An@@ á@@ li@@ sis Digital , has explicitly stated that the image does not origin@@ ate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it represents a &quot; similar &quot; ji@@ hadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture was in circulation in connection with the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am massac@@ re in 2015 , the El Pa@@ is newspaper tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ ya@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ Dün@@ ya@@ U@@ y@@ uy &quot; ( Bur@@ ns , the world sleeps ) .
the DR Congo picture emerged with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and solved a discussion among Muslims after the Bo@@ ko Har@@ am massac@@ re and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities felt greater attention to these events that were pres@@ umed in the name of Islam .
USA , 2015 .
the picture was swe@@ pt for the massac@@ re of Bo@@ ko Har@@ am in 2015 ( and ret@@ we@@ ed more than 9,@@ 300 times ) , but the messages connected with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the goal was to draw attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Indonesian ) , 2014 .
after a message that was suppos@@ edly written by a &quot; father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massac@@ re , discussion forums made it like this in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it a false message .
from the message contained in the DR Congo , the Organization of the Clar@@ et@@ ine Mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dis@@ soci@@ ated .
there are more confirmed examples of an incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
ink also points to other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( in grey ) , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the web cra@@ w@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names associated with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only significantly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may eventually possibly have a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong issues or frames ( fr@@ aming ) that go through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about silence in connection with the assass@@ inations of Christians by Muslims or - to defend Muslims - the assass@@ inations of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is important both . therefore it is worth investig@@ ating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens if readers can no longer believe these pictures .
with social media there are dozens of people who un@@ inten@@ tionally share the water around a trag@@ edy .
suggests this mood of false and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and the actual hor@@ ror of what actually happened in DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( here for example ) .
one argument is that ref@@ using images of a ref@@ usal to recognise the trag@@ edy . sometimes these pictures are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ ze readers and viewers and take them the ability to find emp@@ athy ( such as this study , investig@@ ating how violent media seem to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss regarding for@@ ci@@ ble portra@@ y@@ als in the news media , the fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
techn@@ ologists experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News . &quot; they will have to think about the situation in which a picture suggests something which can actually be used in the context or completely mis@@ used manner .
any investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be .

a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. insur@@ moun@@ table ) endeav@@ ors to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
such words are in each language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ sett@@ able words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese aci@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ ck@@ esa ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly any attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression does not suff@@ ice , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a little context is needed to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected in an online list for quite a while .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find words from the Mw@@ ot@@ ap language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - get tired of your parents in recognition of how you have stri@@ ved for you in your younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and words found in the Hun@@ s@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - The comfort or la@@ zin@@ ess you feel after being war@@ med in the sun on cold days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Birds own words from his blog about :
they dis@@ gr@@ ind other cultures , reve@@ aling other thoughts and aw@@ aken our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page want to publish more of these &quot; insur@@ moun@@ table &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
speakers of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages &quot; which are highly appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to upload their favorite speakers here .

how Sri Lanka changes with the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and earth disaster in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally begins at the end of May , the rivers of Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya occurred in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
after a statement from the disaster centre of Sri Lanka from 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundreds of people are missing because of the flo@@ ods and mud winds .
over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100,000 people have been given to 304 safe resi@@ dences .
the ra@@ inf@@ alls left on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water conditions in some areas went slowly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health and hygiene standards of the population pose a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
flood in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka have regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the cat@@ astrophe .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly flu@@ ids wor@@ sen the Den@@ gue fever crisis , war@@ ns Save the Children after further ra@@ inf@@ all are already on their way .
today the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus was in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also floo@@ ded because of the beaten water peg@@ s of Mor@@ og@@ oda E@@ la .
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and further five are completed for transport@@ ing emergency supplies for the inhabitants of their floo@@ ded villages .
also various organizations and startups have agreed to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka deliver important information about flood situations and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and vital substances for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call 0@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 84@@ 38@@ 41 today if animals need help in this area .
the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f app pic@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Kat@@ ast@@ ax@@ ophone is informed .
last year after the disaster of the Ro@@ an@@ u tropical storm , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button which allowed users to call a vehicle for collection of assistance and donations . they were then forwar@@ ded to the Red Cross free of charge .
similarly , they introduced a &quot; SOS &quot; button which resulted in thousands of en@@ quiries and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people connected by flo@@ ods and land@@ slides .
the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri L@@ ank@@ as , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , people in need help in security and provide assistance .
this prevented the loss of further human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore norm@@ ality .

the Women &apos;s March on January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ ha@@ zi .
use approved .D@@ am@@ als in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and dear friend .
I entr@@ ust her my four years old daughter ; she tru@@ sts me with her children ; she is my rock in the surf .
in the one minute we still call slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next step , we have rights for trans@@ gender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are located in a sea of umbrellas and people , some hold the icon@@ ic picture of a woman with head@@ sc@@ arf high , bound from an American flag , others colli@@ de slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girl@@ friend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already led these conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar , who know it - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that have built up in their imagination .
you kid@@ n@@ apped me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not all look the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all plug@@ ged into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , like me , do not fit into it , are ab@@ sent .
un@@ mus@@ cular to be removed
I &apos;m not alone .
this is even done to the poet whose poetry is best sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which pictures come to mind when you think about it ?
to be in love ?
go to the top of the page
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Kor@@ an and Prophet Muhammad were until the day when he died , the center of his poetry .
but in the western notion , the religion of Rum@@ i was deleted , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists in the re@@ duc@@ tion@@ ist paintings of Muslims who have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting visual language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid dis@@ b@@ anded the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these pictures prot@@ ru@@ de even today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to ste@@ er them .
I have worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful , er@@ ron@@ eous nar@@ rations domin@@ ate our new@@ s@@ feed .
this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that nine Muslim women have led to their countries during the last three decades , while the US did not even choose their first female presidential candidate .
this nar@@ ration fails to recognise that if French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings , and Saudi Arabia , Muslim women are forced to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exer@@ ts its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this strong nar@@ rations weak@@ ens Muslim women who conduct movements for change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is clear that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who were brought here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this narrative has occupied our collective imagination such deep and flaw@@ ed that often Sik@@ h men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and attacks .
because of these stories , which we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion
in the news industry we do more than tell stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ rations which help us understand the world .
and my industry is fail@@ ing to capture the sc@@ ars of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we are here that seven million Muslims constitute the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the Muslim population are African tribes .
six of ten American Muslims are among the first generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .

use approved .
four decades ago my immig@@ rant parents came to New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scrap@@ ers of New York ; sky@@ scrap@@ ers were made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then when Khan thought out the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were dish@@ on@@ est Muslims and Americans .
but am I now a Muslim and American ?
sometimes , when people ask me why I am not eating pork , I say - instead of getting out of my Muslim recipes or wearing my handy pocket , which all Muslims contribute - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I am jo@@ king , we do not wear all hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also have no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be almost always selected for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who try to fight widespread lies on Islam .
these lies are produced at the current tape of a well @-@ ador@@ ned Islamic hos@@ tility with len@@ ders , think tanks and experts for mis@@ information which is our already er@@ ron@@ eous image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in more than just a stranger , who tears a woman the head towel .
or as the fri@@ ghtening map of attacks on mos@@ ques across the United States , see below .
scre@@ enshot of the AC@@ LU page .
Islam hos@@ tility in its ug@@ ly forms attacks our affili@@ ation .
it attacks our identity , which is so expan@@ sive , so versatile and complex that it is impossible to fit into a drawer .

I want to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim was only born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a temporary mos@@ que on the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
if social scientists describe religious life , they refer back to the following terms : belief , behaviour and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behavior are perhaps not always visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girl@@ friend , my neighbour , will see my neigh@@ bor , my rock in the surf , that I am Muslim if it could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the ritual with my daughter when I wie@@ v her in my arms and her Arab verses to protect the Kor@@ an and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them I repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .
the grand@@ mother of the author when she wins an Ik@@ eb@@ ana competition in Kar@@ achi , with her sisters some@@ time in the 1960s .
use approved .
belonging to me is the image of my mother@@ ly mother with her sisters ; as she decades ago a competition of art of flower arran@@ ging in Kar@@ achi .
it is the picture of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : Nano , surrounded by her completed and un@@ finished paintings , painted Su@@ fi @-@ Hei@@ liger ; and a Kor@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and four@@ teen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be Muslim means to speak the prayers that she had said to me when I have a bad day .
to be Muslims is how they taught me to relate to God : Allah , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people that - over centuries - was colon@@ ised by an &quot; empire , &quot; which was founded by a company with the name of ven@@ erable British East@@ er@@ e@@ dies Company , it has a profound meaning to name God , my only Lord .
the author in 1987 with her grand@@ father .
use approved .
belonging to this means to grow up and to hear that men do not we@@ ep , but at the same time seeing that my immig@@ rant grand@@ father cri@@ es .
in between , while he writes books on modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana J@@ aan we@@ pt un@@ um@@ ably about his family in India ruled by K@@ ash@@ mir , family , which he could not close in half a century .
belonging to it is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , as with my grand@@ father , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists , who have divided the Muslim world as at the game risk .
to be Muslim means to know that over the last two centuries , Europeans have all been colon@@ ised to four Muslim countries .
it means to know that the first aerial bom@@ bing of history was dropped by a Muslim country in front of a century ago .
it means to know that at the same time the grand@@ father of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , c@@ ash@@ ish sub@@ due of the British empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as he led the first mos@@ que in England .
even before there were planes he travelled to more parts of the world when I was ever and preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

to belong to my Muslim tribe of the 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable pedi@@ gre@@ es ; our un@@ related history .
it means remember@@ ing that four@@ teen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops station@@ ed across every continent apart from the Ant@@ arc@@ tica , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means to know that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the rub@@ ble of war .
to be an American Muslim means to know that the su@@ icide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that if a trag@@ edy is pun@@ ishing the US and the susp@@ ect bears a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means to know that four@@ teen hundred years ago the first prayer @-@ call , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a fre@@ ed black slave .
it means to know that two hundred years ago an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad ens@@ lav@@ ed and brought into this country .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life counts .
an American woman , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a p@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist means to identify the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple hy@@ ph@@ ens , but to fail to communicate them to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the narrative of the 1.7 billion holds more possibilities than a cube , but it is represented in the reduced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
being a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged persons build structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia on this sec@@ t@@ edness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in Muslim registr@@ ars who began with President Bush and extended to President Obama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it consists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists in the immigration officer who takes a five year old child into hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in a country that closes its borders towards people from just the countries that are bom@@ bar@@ ded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ Fly list &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which largely accepts Arab@@ s and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars that we run and bom@@ bs that we reject in Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell us , we are here today .
in a study entitled Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists of the North@@ western University of participants showed a scienti@@ fic@@ ally correct picture and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 regarding evolution .
Muslims received the least score .
the conversations that we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep to sof@@ ten the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous imag@@ inations that we ste@@ al in our news editors .
at least , there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry trying to capture our many identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast Lake Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the pod@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ Bad@@ Muslim ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schubert &apos;s Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to propag@@ ate Muslim writers and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ KI@@ STAN@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope .

but I &apos;m concerned about this difficult global time we are in .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspir@@ acy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the internet now lead the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown ex@@ pon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown ex@@ pon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years before , it had not yet been given ; now they domin@@ ate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the re@@ alities and history I was not aware of when I was as old as my daughter is now , but who today made me a w@@ asted Muslim .
things I have left in my speech like a bread@@ crum@@ b .
things that might aw@@ aken memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that our humanity makes , a story may listen , where someone is made to another .
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Ber@@ kel@@ ey , con@@ vers@@ ations take place within the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred acade@@ mics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural rac@@ ism , &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are led and people are being resear@@ ched through the creation of the &quot; other &quot; in the public imagination , four decades ago even the Science of Stan@@ ford was .
we have to ask ourselves un@@ comfortable questions after the role of being consciously and un@@ consciously to soli@@ di@@ fy the &quot; other &quot; ; just as my girl@@ friend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have no president , who bom@@ bed the chocolate cake , while he already bom@@ bed countries and &quot; other people , &quot; goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity
story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r users Daniele Rossi , using license CC BY @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a possibility to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn P@@ erry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) initiative , the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the insur@@ moun@@ table blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has conducted events since 2015 , the risk is that small and not quite as small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
for the makers of the project :
the mass ext@@ in@@ ction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces where residents don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening often to understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events are instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to appreciate , to feel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format stor@@ yt@@ ellers start their story in their own language first and translate or explain them in English .
even if the participants are not a professional story t@@ eller , their devot@@ ion and their representation lead to the fact that the audience can be informed .
they call laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story in Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the story narr@@ ator R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou kon@@ ate takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for their country .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the be@@ ak of the rab@@ bit and the bab@@ oon in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; &quot; &quot; after explaining the meaning of his fork , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a wide gr@@ in he shares his sense of inclusi@@ veness : &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have listened to !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
so far the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to extend this . everyone who is inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own history of history .
Puerto Rico calls for re @-@ determination of sovereign debt
with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amount to 72 million US dollars , on 3 April 2017 , various religious and civil organizations participated in a mass demonstration ; the march started at the puert@@ a Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went up to Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ an .
it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano por la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ tiz@@ ens front for the ne@@ ural examination of the debt ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church assembly Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of re @-@ determination of the debt also submitted a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Rico claim that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for deb@@ ts will be held ac@@ coun@@ table for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a management committee with no personal interests in public deb@@ ts , with a fixed amount of re@@ mun@@ eration that acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will be black@@ mail@@ ed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Rico ref@@ uses to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not decline with decl@@ ining pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not in the state of state built @-@ in territory of the USA - suff@@ ers from a severe financial crisis .
hence the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation , proposes a law on soci@@ o@@ economic development , a law on public responsibility , as an alternative to existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economic and financial crisis Puerto Rico demands a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
measures imposed on extern@@ ally will be at risk without the participation and convic@@ tions of citizens to be rejected by the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wake @-@ up for light and truth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members continue to campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he has made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference on digital culture , which is hosted in Berlin , an event dedicated to the # Free@@ B@@ el campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , managing director of Book Spr@@ ints , publish@@ es books within three to five days , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ quiry ( The cost of freedom : collective research ) .
the book published last year contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of supp@@ ression .
it is a hom@@ age to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built and what the real cost associated with it .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked on side by side to look beyond the fog that surro@@ unds our new@@ s@@ feed and to create some sense from our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated internet volunteer who has been det@@ ained in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was cancelled from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about his current state or residence .
the intro@@ duc@@ tory part of his book with the title Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , right away .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has let many of us start thinking about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given up in this process of time @-@ wise extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in the custo@@ dy of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military facility to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; Military Police of Bass@@ el had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the Military Court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 who presented themselves as insi@@ der of the Assad administration and made them aware of an alleged death sentence against their husband .
however , his where@@ ab@@ outs and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer of creative comm@@ ons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Bar@@ ry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ sels had anticipated cultural prot@@ otypes as the work he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually recon@@ struct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civili@@ zations , and here Greek @-@ Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persi@@ an influence .
at that time , Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would do everything to wi@@ pe out this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this stri@@ pe in digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be in@@ valuable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
trag@@ ically , Bass@@ el has not yet been able to complete this project .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my whole life with dre@@ aming of freedom and b@@ ass@@ el taught me to embrace it .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English even when he was in det@@ ention .
I have learned to read , write and speak English well .
he always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked . he taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened my door to technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners how they use computers , at least theore@@ tically without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the Author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a Pro@@ mis@@ uch that she wrote to her husband during the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custo@@ dy .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together on the book for one year .
she sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English .
the book is freely available .
book envel@@ ope by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It happens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happens every time you visit ,
that I sink in the world of your lovely eyes ,
that I lose the contempl@@ ation in the moment we embrace ,
that each of the dangers does not matter ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ackl@@ es and watch@@ men
I forget the j@@ ail@@ ment of the prison
and I go into every detail of your voice and words
which I wear with my passion ,
if your eyes say Le@@ be@@ wohl
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to bring all the moments back ,
and to cry over your absence and smile .
I convince myself that I will return soon ...

Bas@@ sels history is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) has disappeared more than 6@@ 5,000 people .
those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime of violence have been tort@@ ured or even executed .
according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ ne@@ sty International , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in det@@ ention since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we reiter@@ ate our call today in the hope that we must do this for the last time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moz@@ ambi@@ que : again convic@@ ted of corruption by convic@@ ted director after release
Moz@@ ambi@@ que responded with anger to a corruption case where a member of the government returned to work in the state apparatus after half of his prison sentence on which the corruption was committed .
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other def@@ endants .
the money came from public funds from the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , whose advice was Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for his re@@ pres@@ sions to the company , which happened on 19 April .
in accordance with an opinion of the General Public Prosec@@ utor of the Republic , which submitted the application , there would be no obstacle to Cam@@ b@@ aza to re @-@ apply his old post , since the company did not fulfil discipline procedures after his imprisonment .
however , many inhabitants do not have the action good .
the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Int@@ eg@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short CI@@ P ) , a local institution which advoc@@ ates public transparency in an interview with Deutsche Welle , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step forward with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as CI@@ P . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we are aware of is that the company should lead a disciplinary approach to the contrary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the company seemed to have no reasonable legal steps to apply the corresponding functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the ambi@@ que social media , also decl@@ ines this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war@@ dly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ b@@ aza was a competent guy , he would be coun@@ sel@@ or after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and has left half of them .
he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating spe@@ eches he could advise and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent he cons@@ ented to become re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inf@@ li@@ ct damage .
consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza is liked to be paid for its silence .
res@@ isti@@ ble !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambi@@ que and student of political science in Brazil says , the director does not have mor@@ ale :
Cam@@ b@@ aza is rewarded by the state because he en@@ acted him I cannot believe that one rewarded someone in such a way that has already been massi@@ vely off@@ ended the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza is lacking the mor@@ ality to return and serve the state * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but it was only served by the state itself .
Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state as it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself became tired of this man who was un@@ loaded and finally sentenced to a long sentence .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded .
Fran@@ c@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remind that a th@@ ief is in prison :
thi@@ eves belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el not only to remain in memory of the Moz@@ ambi@@ ans for always as the first independent president , but also as a keen , incis@@ i@@ ve and - by the side - proph@@ etic speaking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations was when he vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious human being able to sell also the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sam@@ ora said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tac@@ tic , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious human being is at the same time criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also decl@@ ining :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat 10 years and was free .
and today the company , with which he inde@@ b@@ ted money , put him under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ α@@ β@@ ι@@ к Passport ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 . may 2017

&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Myanmar and enti@@ tles many users to injus@@ tice &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means ch@@ ick@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ itting b@@ asses . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to information from Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts out of the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &apos; Indian &apos; .
Facebook c@@ ens@@ ored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar , &quot; as part of an initiative in order to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network .
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alistic movements has given the word an extremely decre@@ asing con@@ not@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has c@@ ens@@ ored a lot of useful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word itself does not automatically invoke hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubt for its use .
in addition , there are several bur@@ mes@@ an words with different mean@@ ings , which have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , stool is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( spl@@ itting b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ ker A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty fashion if they knew how he could alle@@ vi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n .
the sentence ku la - &quot; He@@ aling &quot; ( ku ) + the Frag@@ ew@@ ort ( la ) in Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that it will reduce hate speech by radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook needs to be more analytical before putting all posts that stand in sus@@ pic@@ ion to spread rac@@ ism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not manually . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it filters the word automatically .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what it should do instead is to analyze the post carefully and check it by checking out the next words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the good is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , receive fairly good lesson .
now it is time to circum@@ cise their nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to all who dis@@ semin@@ ate hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat has proven that the c@@ ens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or alternative way of writing of the c@@ ens@@ ored word in order to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to clear his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; b@@ anned from the social network :
... when I got attention to this new policy of Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was chat@@ ting about the li@@ ken , post and sharing of content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; failed to follow &quot; the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author wrote his opinion on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet Community asking for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work .
c@@ ens@@ ing such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Erb@@ sen@@ curr@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied posts .
if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million us@@ ef@@ ul@@ ness that would give them a big turnover , that would be great .
fac@@ ebook automatic c@@ ens@@ orship has caused much ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun on Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net .
here you can see some scre@@ enshots of Facebook posts which have no hate speech but still have been removed :
used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a curr@@ y and watch an Indian film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to try out if Facebook removed the post that contains the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scre@@ enshot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , heal people then ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scre@@ enshot , used with permission .
in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks is meant to increase violence in the communities of Myanmar , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook was cri@@ tici@@ zed for his failure to bring out the prolifer@@ ation of hate speech on his bur@@ m@@ ese sides . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but instead of simply c@@ ens@@ ing the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better running , more focused on context than on code focused initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tobago ends with the child marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .

the child &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago .
on 9 June 2017 , Parliament of the country voted un@@ anim@@ ously a law to ban this practice , so that the age @-@ bearing age is now 18 .
before this change of the married couple , some members held Hin@@ du and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 , Bro@@ ther Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , leader of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not be interfer@@ ed with , since that , age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this occurred despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner of the UN child rights convention , the min@@ ors as , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defined every person under 18 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children , who were married to 15 , amounted to 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tobago , and with 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the statistical Central Office of the country confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 by 1997 @-@ 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements who endeav@@ oured to aboli@@ sh laws to children &apos;s marriage followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this result .
nevertheless , not everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the cri@@ tic of the child marriage , they should , dam@@ ned to take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition made tensions in this really un@@ complicated thing , and some@@ time doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the draft law at all .
but at the beginning of 2017 the bill against the child wo@@ e was decided - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country must agree and pro@@ claim the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle once again posted on Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the child marriage was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and no one against it .
having previously agreed in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of social media users were thr@@ illed , because the laws of the children &apos;s marriage had finally been changed .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is clo@@ thed with a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk , which has vei@@ led the core of the matter , but know what ? the marriage @-@ marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago , and this is worth almost any price .
while Abel was the opinion , it was definitely long enough to aboli@@ sh the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , , Excellent news !
the law has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for this - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
the Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society group , who spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law , noted :
the mar@@ rying age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft amend@@ ment to the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz@@ es was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 .
in the House of Represent@@ atives there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties and 35 of them were present at the vote .
all MEPs who were opposed have voted for the law .
the child marriage is no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tobago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ min@@ ding shield .
many thanks to all activists who fought him .
congratulations .
a thanks to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organization of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; months ago Mahar@@ aj has declared his intention to take legal action , the law should be passed and he seems to rede@@ em his promise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General , Paris Al @-@ ra@@ wi , a pro@@ ponent of the law , said it was quite legitimate , if Mahar@@ aj wanted to go against the law , most social media users wanted to address the debate differently .
Patricia Wor@@ rell proposed :
rather sat when we , instead of talking about the discussion so general , in a way that can only cause panic and dis@@ grace , in a way that would invite the state into our bedrooms , &quot; simply target@@ edly talk about that the state , our daughters , prevent them from being ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ dden men , who are opposite to them , &quot; would you then be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to a judicial action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where the child marriage is legal or still the norm although there are laws that are prohibited .

at 11.@@ 15 the message was removed from the side - but in the intermediate storage it remained intact .

on Sunday , the Office of the Public Prosec@@ utor &apos;s office shared the local news service Yar@@ News that they were h@@ acked .
through the mirrors of web pages , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again
the English @-@ speaking Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and PI@@ PA copyright legislation in the United States , internationally dark@@ ened .
created by Wikipedia ( CC BY @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month Turkey has now blocked the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pedia Wikipedia .
day by day , it becomes clear how important the platform for users is to find and share reliable information and reliable information .
both students and rep@@ or@@ ters and fans of TV @-@ series defend themselves against the block@@ age .
although many technology @-@ sealed Internet users are used to use re@@ tool@@ ing tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third biggest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence of the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently published in an published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been held since 2007 , after the Internet law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
after China , Turkey is the world &apos;s most famous country , when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform continues to be locked , several mir@@ ror@@ pages ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) are di@@ pped .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform put all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. computer calcul@@ ator connections ) , which does not support the system of domain names and thus makes a complete c@@ ens@@ orship difficult .
the content is available in spite of the legal prohibition .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after we have heard the news ( about the block@@ age of Wikipedia ) , we put all of it in writing snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the content in a de@@ centralized and distributed way .
this can help users view at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org .
IP@@ FS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only about scre@@ enshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to b@@ ypass the lock .

a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation
a r@@ ins@@ ing r@@ hin@@ oc@@ eros , Ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with badly placed motifs and washed colors .
this motivated him to carry a camera with him and try to get the situation grac@@ ed .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to bring Nepal to the international stage .
and his hom@@ etown directly next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this first class situation helps him in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested from home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti River would be a le@@ op@@ ard .
the dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran out with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father was watching him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started to kin@@ dle pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar aims to collabor@@ ate with the authorities to gain global recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not so fri@@ ghtening as they look .
and he should know it , for he faced face to face to face to face ,
a tiger can not distur@@ b the opinion of the sheep in sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the bu@@ cket appeared . he immediately goes , we see ourselves and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for beauty &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to take photographs of Ot@@ tern in the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he was able to photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodations .
see below some of these photos .

years after the wedding , Indian women first dare to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands

this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on video Vol@@ unte@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international media organisation from India .
a revised version was published as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women avoid having the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
instead they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h women admit that they respect the husband because of social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences they should consider the norm to keep this practice alive .
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto from the Indian state O@@ dish@@ a was convic@@ ted by a head@@ court and exp@@ elled from her family and the village community after having addressed a married relatives with names .
the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives is also common among men . however , they have far less ad@@ vices to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of P@@ une in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel and hou@@ se@@ wives , joined a unique club and quickly became the main theme of the city .
it is a place for them only in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the # K@@ hel@@ bad@@ al campaign , which is operated by the community of Video Vol@@ unte@@ ers and set up for the disman@@ tling of the patri@@ archy .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ war has been working with the help of her video camera for seven years at the discovery of practices such as children &apos;s marriage and the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS infected , and leads this club .
she reports how this club created a safe place for these women and at the same time they made them amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion lap was women who do not call their hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this subject , because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify .
un@@ pron@@ oun@@ cing the name of their hus@@ bands is a custom that they are du@@ ly deb@@ ated and never ques@@ tioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not respect this is regarded as dec@@ eit@@ ful , as a woman without mor@@ ality .
tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband in the name of her husband , wanted to try at home as it is running .
she showed the video of the discussion lap her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent until the video was over .
U@@ h@@ hm .. How@@ dy there , simply changed into alert to your blog through Google , and found that it is truly informative . thank you and best of luck . S@@ var
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to take the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with various feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ z from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on breaking a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women must never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells us :
a woman was so shy that she ch@@ ick@@ ed only in front of her during the whole exercise ; another decided to release the whole fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in adren@@ alin rush about having broken with an old custom , the women decided that they would actually try at home to call their hus@@ bands in their name .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a multitude of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put on women &apos;s head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member chose to do it at dinner in front of the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini thought I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation carried out in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the cin@@ ded red dot on the foreh@@ ead , indicating the status of the sp@@ ouses :
why do women only need to show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband that I would wear the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he also did . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laugh@@ ed only and I stopped wearing it .
the other women have not fully listened to them , but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves , not to wear it on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip at each discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their life ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so hon@@ estly about some things , such as our identi@@ ties attached to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say certain things , no matter how small they occur .
in a panel discussion we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected to the clothing .
some women in the group have been wearing sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most , this is okay , but some wanted a sal@@ ine cur@@ ta , a wide shirt above a pants , they did not dar@@ ed .
after much contro@@ vers@@ y and discussion about the advantages of their own choice of clothes , mor@@ als associated with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini donated their own couple of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion round so that the women could carry them .
next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will manage it .
to the question whether in the five months since their first discussion club has changed something , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things are slowly getting into the roles :
so far we have done only small steps .
some women rehear@@ sed it a few times , but then stopped telling the name of her husband .
some , including me , make it yet , but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now carry Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their foreh@@ ead at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like viol@@ in@@ ists for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothing - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how to explain Roh@@ ini :
each of us is a victim of patri@@ archy .
I am it too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we do .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
scre@@ enshot of the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
on June 29th of this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag strengthens Entrepren@@ eurship Bains ( Beat@@ les Day ) in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans re@@ plac@@ ed memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit to the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as an u @-@ turn in the Japanese culture of post @-@ war years .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko who was exclusively inter@@ viewed in London in 1964 , noticed in 2016 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just under five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to allow the Japanese to go through .
the people here quite quickly became clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many known Japanese sizes had reached its zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les first came to Japan in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
good morning ! congratulations Today is the Beat@@ les Com@@ mem@@ oration Day in Japan . arrested 51 years ago they were here in Tokyo .

the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves all .
today is Beat@@ les commem@@ oration .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll is to represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
and as it is for fans , Japanese also make pilgri@@ m@@ ages to the famous places connected with the band .
if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places that you must necessarily visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry F@@ ields ( Memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
( from the link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
pilgri@@ m@@ ages can sometimes not be bizar@@ re enough :
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les commem@@ oration .
just today in 1966 the Beat@@ les arrived for the first time in Japan .
the characters from the K @-@ On series were on a pilgrimage to London and ran across the Abbey Road .
the same we did last year .
and of course some companies use the fan base also commerci@@ ally viable , just like this R@@ amen shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! congratulations Today is Beat@@ les Memorial Day .
and what could this be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; today I will listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ esterday &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;

flat @-@ headed men are drag@@ ged and killed in Moz@@ ambi@@ que
the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia warned the population that believing men could be in Moz@@ ambi@@ que &apos;s target of attacks .

a new system of kid@@ n@@ apping people for organ traff@@ icking , pres@@ um@@ ably for ab@@ usive purposes , distur@@ bs the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambi@@ que . the local government now called a series of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ k , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was found be@@ headed and part of the organs were taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently they conf@@ essed that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi are used .
there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a cat @-@ headed man could bring gold or bring wealth , the police spokes@@ man of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia of the BBC .
it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks on flat @-@ headed men were registered in Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
another group , the goal of murder for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN in 2016 introduced a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ce .
U@@ kom@@ be Wey@@ a lives in the city of Map@@ uto .
he warned those who plan to travel to the country :
bew@@ are of bald men who travel to Moz@@ ambi@@ que low @-@ headed men in Moz@@ ambi@@ que are target ritu@@ alistic attacks , warned the mos@@ que police according to the newest assass@@ ination of three men &apos;s men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange where the assass@@ inations took place .
Hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Moz@@ ambi@@ que said that the local police already had the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and murder of spar@@ se @-@ headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , has been commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also indicates that there existed a faith , according to which the victims in the head had power to generate the riches .
in recent days , three men have been killed with hair loss problems in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared on Facebook the chron@@ icle of blo@@ gger &apos;s poor Sn@@ ai@@ pp@@ a who suggested that the problem is part of the major social difficulty facing Moz@@ ambi@@ que :
I M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ TE likes to be attracted to E@@ IN MO@@ SAM@@ BI@@ K , THE SI@@ CH is ashamed of going to the street , attrac@@ ting men from the foot@@ age of a por@@ no film in which the teachers would be ashamed to make sex against good notes , work and other achievements , a nation in which people would not hurt or even take their lives to get their bread , a country in which neither the al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or &quot; black magic &quot; are hun@@ ted to achieve rapid riches .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some of the opportunities could not be missed for Mac@@ ab@@ ren hum@@ or .

Bas@@ sels stay and constitution were unknown until today ( August 01 , 2017 ) , when N@@ our@@ a learned from Syrian officials that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , we all prove to be a pioneer of the Open Web @-@ movement as a pioneer of the Open Web @-@ movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we appreciate the efforts of all the people and organizations that have been working for his release in the last five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 6,@@ 000 people have disappeared , such as the Syrian Network for Human Rights .

free Bass@@ el : ne@@ tizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ates and dis@@ sident Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of Chinese dis@@ sident , Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized for liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( State endanger@@ ment ) , having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o demanding the democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China described Li@@ us case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal affair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said a spokes@@ man , he considered it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , China continues to allow calls from the international community to release the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or permit him to treat him abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out to the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press summar@@ ized several reactions from abroad .
United Nations United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
a spokes@@ man , however , refused to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Li@@ u abroad to be treated .
Norway , Norway , Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ us &apos;s release .
the relationship between China and Norway came into a shock after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government told that this was nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations continued until December last year . in June Norway signed an agreement to res@@ ume the salmon drivers to China as exports since 2010 were largely blocked .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for un@@ conditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his award in Oslo .
because of his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union and the European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament passed a decision on which China was asked to release Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants .
the EU &apos;s top @-@ level diplom@@ at , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for China to release Li@@ us as she reported in an explanation on 30 June :
at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr Li@@ us wife as well as family members .
they are to be able to meet and receive all visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Terr@@ y Bran@@ stad shared that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wish him that he has the opportunity for treatment abroad , in so far as it assi@@ sts him with his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ person for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on 27 June that the emb@@ assy asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u but also to release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from their house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US Embassy promp@@ ted an angry response from China , with the utter@@ ance of the State Department that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to inter@@ fere with interven@@ ing and ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared that China should offer the couple :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protection and freedom such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice to which they are entitled according to the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also introduced a resolution to the Congress to un@@ condi@@ tionally release the Chinese government to un@@ condi@@ tionally release Li@@ u and his wife .
I urge China to un@@ condi@@ tionally release the Nobel Prize winner # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o so that he can embar@@ k on proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany , 4 min
&quot; &quot; &quot; German government spokes@@ person Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hope Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared at the G@@ 20 Summit in Hamburg on July 7 and 8 .
previously diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Reu@@ ters that China had great concerns if the vor@@ ti@@ ces around Li@@ u could sur@@ pass the visit to Hamburg .
USA , Canada , Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked China to provide Li@@ u an appropriate medical treatment and give him the opportunity to leave his family .
FR &apos;s attor@@ ney told AF@@ P earlier that Li@@ u X@@ ia could visit him every day , but the police always over@@ sees the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to contact anyone outside , including his attor@@ neys , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells us :
Canada calls on China to maintain its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to release the rights perpet@@ rated for the exercise of these rights .
France and France
in a statement on 29 June , France &apos;s Foreign Office invited China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian grounds :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o will receive all treatments he needs , regardless of where you need . furthermore , his wife and family can have contact with him .

he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he was severely pun@@ ished would have led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .

Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore . Singapore .

is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may seem sil@@ ly , as Singapore is recognised at an international level as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , Singapore should be considered a city .
this re@@ mark has spar@@ ked a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State of New York , the minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries .
he supports Singapore as a city .
... no one ques@@ tioned whether New York was a democracy ...
this is where most people commit a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog of Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turn up logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing dictat@@ orial exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , we can say that we are not a country in the end .
it so@@ unded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it then ?
the reasons imposed by Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am were not very no@@ bel : he def@@ ended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , given that he appeared in@@ vari@@ ably un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he def@@ ended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally towns that are guided permanently by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once one reaches the core of the topic , the good old ly@@ re emerg@@ es from the author@@ it@@ arian rulers who pret@@ end to be Democrats , leave the twi@@ sted logic , since it fits better to their power .
in the final event , the answers given in the last week of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am were given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system really non @-@ answers .
he cam@@ oufl@@ aged appropriate questions with non @-@ answers ration@@ ally .
Rachel Z@@ eng challenges Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to what country belongs to our city ...
in short , I understand nothing .
I would be very grateful if our valued K Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am would take the trouble to clarify this point as long as he was paid up to be part of the government of the City of Singapore .
by publishing his comment on the blog , he points out the critics that one should start reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference to better understand the context of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am &apos;s statements , according to Singapore is a city and no country .
read the tran@@ scription .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ even important even when we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compar@@ es Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
when he said , Singapore is not a country , &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense !
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , who as leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ...
at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it is right and aware of what he def@@ ends .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review spl@@ its the weak points of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ ams Argum@@ ents :
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trusted a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a wrong speaker ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we will only be regarded as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , on which country go back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since he plays an important role within the government cabinet , the statements of Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am are of serious importance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
why do the people of Singapore afford their military service , do they only defend their city but not their country ?
who does our Prime Minister have to pay bills ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
, ten@@ das the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade zur Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapur is and was always a city :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not said what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this pro@@ position seems to have anger@@ ed many people of Singapur ...
no one ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country especially &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; etc , but this is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; cute Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
scre@@ enshot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , with the rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world to be revealed and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question I most asked in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; I answer . &quot; I am from Canada . &quot; I have been living in Japan since 1994 .
depending on the situation the conversation occurs , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his convers@@ ational partner by asking personal questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my clari@@ fication follows mostly the standard answer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many Canadi@@ ans perhaps cook in@@ war@@ dly against anger when they are held for Americans but me don &apos;t bo@@ ther me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Canadi@@ ans from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans make a Canadian flag well visible to their ruck@@ sack when they travel .
all dear Canadi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand ... .
so it was when I began travelling through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before 11 September .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neigh@@ bors .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exc@@ use &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends , whom I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter if you were confused with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
firstly , being called &quot; cute &quot; means to be sp@@ ie@@ bly - just like the ben@@ ign , gentle but trag@@ ically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has an own Canadian Doppel@@ gän@@ ger ) .
if Canada really is a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no edges and edges , nothing where you can come across .
to be harm@@ less means to be in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and to earn no attention .
this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from things that happen around you .
I would even go far to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a major part of the Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; perhaps is simply cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadi@@ ans do not often talk about the fence with the neigh@@ bors .
we lack the warm , open friendliness that I have now connected with my American friends .
luck@@ ily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau betra@@ ys the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot;
Musik@@ video einer Pop @-@ Band par@@ ody
a pop band in Thailand has released a music video that par@@ aphr@@ ases the Jun@@ ta , which seized power in 2014 and in spite of its promises to restore the civil government , continues to rule the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new song &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ em@@ Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man telling them what rules his girl@@ friend makes for him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although not explicitly political , the music video indirectly relates to the ongoing military su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video to the song was a huge success .
within the first three days alone , the video uploaded to Facebook 1,@@ 254 times and was awarded 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists invited the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially about the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these recordings of the video , which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has been pursuing over the past three years .
the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; possibly relate to the dra@@ con@@ ical section 44 of the pro@@ visional constitution , which gives the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army absolute decision @-@ making on important national issues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; setting up changes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people considered by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit in the army was set up to super@@ vise the online content and prosec@@ uted people accused of le@@ ver@@ aging the mon@@ archy .
Thailand sets a conflict against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ est &quot; ( Maj@@ estic ) .
on 20 May 2014 the war law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax pay@@ ers .
in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black v@@ ans , before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long sentences , they should ins@@ ult the mon@@ archy .
meanwhile the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band who im@@ it@@ ated the Sal@@ ut &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by coup @-@ opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life goes on in the ruins of the ghost cities in eastern Ab@@ y@@ asi@@ es

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the OC Media website and published here with kind permission .
the post @-@ war society is slowly gaining ground in East @-@ East @-@ East Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has now passed over 20 years since the Georgi@@ an @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ hic war officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still very visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the Kohl@@ enbe@@ ck of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
various ethnic groups like Russi@@ ans , Greeks , Dep@@ u@@ aries , Georgi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to Soviet sites in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today , the majority of Russi@@ ans and tur@@ f live in the area .
such settlements are also called ghost cities in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
in the pre @-@ war period there were more than 10,000 people here , today there are only a few hundred people in these ages .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16,@@ 000 people after barely risen over a decade .
in 1989 some 43,@@ 000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ t@@ schu@@ ch@@ kov@@ kas stand for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are exp@@ elled and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts a conversation and it &apos;s hard for him to stop this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is nevertheless unique . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens who served all of the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ rail@@ ed mag@@ nific@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
in the ghost town D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ v , which still houses one or two families , can be seen on the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in my hand , they withdraw immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother allowed us to photograph us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she simply b@@ anned us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers little to her girl@@ friend and suddenly she leaves the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company named T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for self @-@ consumption ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable growing .
it is difficult to get over the rounds .
in winter the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow cour@@ g@@ ettes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about ten years ago an elderly woman named Gal@@ ina ( or aunt G@@ AL@@ YA as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to D@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite her el@@ dest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will stay forever in Ab@@ ch@@ asia &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she adm@@ its . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aunt G@@ AL@@ YA tells that she and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 90 year old woman and a young family and I live in this building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if holidays are , we visit us .
but we cannot do this constantly - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
as she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls T@@ ante G@@ AL@@ YA to her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could cultivate cour@@ g@@ ettes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow cour@@ g@@ ettes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can get used to everything &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as &apos;s inter@@ loc@@ utor Nat@@ ascha lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day it rec@@ alls the village life before the war .
despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the land of Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take a while , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha gets about $ 9 children &apos;s money for each child .
her husband is working in the coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s nur@@ ser@@ y was once located , they hold pigs , cows , co@@ cks and ch@@ ick@@ ens .

you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has rather something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived like it was right .
every day I remember how the city and the war were once . &quot;

a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .

a group of children are now scre@@ aming the ball .

these ruins are part of their childhood who care for dis@@ comfort in their lives .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants on their long journey
Concep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez guides a small hotel in Tap@@ ah@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border from Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by Amy Br@@ acken was published on April 19 , 2017 at the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and published here with kind permission .
on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ah@@ ula , located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican guy , a small woman with a cor@@ als @-@ pink spectac@@ le frame and gold colored earrings in ted@@ dy bear shape .
she is called Concep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and grew up in Tap@@ ah@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is owed to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a target for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on the transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about $ 2.50 per night guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - but hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants come here .
sometimes , tells Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people come in full small buses and from the top of the coast they begin to cry : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has received 200 guests simultaneously .
there are only 24 rooms , some even slept outside on cardboard boxes .
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse nobody .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy drugs that they cannot pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted by the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived recently .
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ call@@ i , who has a jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bart ) pos@@ ing with Concep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Br@@ acken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
you have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move nor@@ th@@ wards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tells that the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel along the route and that Afri@@ cans are already talking to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was weak@@ ened , he has begun his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he respon@@ ds sm@@ iling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her that her guests often send text messages when they have gone to gre@@ et her or to report her about the course of her journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
she does not know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spark hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ah@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela .
Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela and his family have mig@@ rated this winter in their little house .
he is polic@@ eman and found that the bus tickets to many African migrants are sold too expensive .
he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night .
at the moment 25 people are there , mostly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Val@@ en@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his job@@ site .

China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang people are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
ein Check @-@ Point für Personal Kommunikations@@ geräte in X@@ inj@@ ang von Twitter @-@ Nutzer transforming chromos@@ enzymes pap@@ aya hy@@ t@@ ã µ@@ ã µ@@ ã ¼ ã ¹ ã ® ã ¹ ã ® ã ® ã ¹ ã ® ã ® ã ¹ ã ® ã ® ã ¹ ã ® ã ® ã ¹ ã ® ã &quot; ã &quot;
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minorities region in the west of China , are comp@@ elled to install a spy@@ ware on their phones .
on 10 July , the mobile phone users in the Tian@@ shan District of the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a cell phone notification in which it noti@@ fies the district government to install a surveillance app called Jing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in communication , it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preventing access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the authorities knew the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture , because they had already installed the app to exchange messages with a private cloud group .
in the announcement of the police , the app would detect and prosec@@ ute the sources and the distribution channels of terrorists along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; dam@@ aging information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
Jing@@ w@@ ang@@ s website describes the app as follows :
Jing@@ w@@ ang is a security service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main function is blocking porno@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network .
this app with filtering for min@@ ors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even hacker to manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or ste@@ al it from it .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while reports on digital c@@ ens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those living in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit distur@@ ban@@ ces and dis@@ satisfaction in the conflict regions , the authorities often arrange extreme ten@@ ants and surveillance measures , as well as routine internet shut@@ dow@@ ns .
based on Twitter @-@ based media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China , &quot; the c@@ ens@@ ored news published in China showed photos of a check@@ point where police officers were random@@ ly exam@@ ining whether they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official Jing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required the app to install the app within 10 days .
if you are discovered at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be det@@ ained up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use devices intended for elderly people .
this is a form of captivity by the rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China , &quot; also published a Jing@@ w@@ ang product description from which the software can raise the requ@@ is@@ ite request of a Windows operating system and therefore receive un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after the installation of Jing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones are used in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the provisions in Jing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Council Council to minimize the distribution of illegal content .
all government branches , authorities and institutions connected with the party , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of cy@@ ber security office while operating their computers and communication devices .
a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published a regulation on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media storage cards &quot; at the local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible quot@@ ations , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything cri@@ es to death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sle@@ ep or Death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world you look at yourself and realize that you are all alone in a place where everything is important .
everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth which is clearly recogni@@ zable from both inside and outside .
one that makes all honour to her name .
one who has kno@@ cked down in a list of feelings and expressions that don &apos;t allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but when reality rec@@ alls you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the actor , the beautiful scenes and the performers - the characters transform into beings from flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es to death .
all doubts dis@@ solve in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the Earth is on the axis of evil . it becomes clear to you that you are caught between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone .
they have arrested me and my father three times , but this was not enough so that I &quot; learn my lesson &quot; as the chief of the security service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure .
he demonstrated his power over us by destroying even the simpl@@ est concepts we knew .
five yo@@ ung@@ sters were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest .
it was enough for the city to sh@@ orten the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ams .
all the neighborhood cov@@ eted , only my own not .
for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city that has been added to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accompli@@ ces .
in the third night things had cal@@ med down somewhat after the power supply stopped functioning in the district .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through silence by cr@@ ying several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice contradic@@ ted by the silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt cour@@ ageous enough to find together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we alli@@ ed us to a splendid picture that filled my expectations full and completely .
at such a moment you are aware that you fre@@ eze the mind from the lamp , but it is simply not interested in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you your voice after you have scre@@ amed it all the way up to the office of the security service from the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear how you cry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or you are only cour@@ ageous enough to cry when we are not near . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his eyes filled with hat@@ eful eyes were on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you are really sorry to see me in my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then did nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was in my foo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , van@@ ity , perhaps at the revolution .
I was so sure of my cause when I answered : &quot; I wouldn &apos;t have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
and I think I never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the short@@ est conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I never regre@@ t@@ ted a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in sol@@ itary position and his father right away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is the same with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stri@@ fe of this cur@@ sed pro@@ position is up to this day in the nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a mental torture that I was subjected to months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I passed through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I wear with myself .
then back through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a passage to the individual cells .
I would like to take care of all details before I enter the room .
otherwise they probably have assigned me a larger cell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share them with only one more prison@@ er and must put me immediately without waiting for their permission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the civil servant left the cell and I grab@@ bed a well @-@ proven communication method : to beat the wall with the f@@ ist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell @-@ mate was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chief prison@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he answered me ultimately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; apparently in none of the surrounding cells there was a respected middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the doctor &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in perfect darkness , there are no distinctive facial features , and doctors don &apos;t have it here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers deny its existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will immediately stop .
the investig@@ ator assured me that they would release him if I remain .
Camping and Carav@@ anning .
I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to exp@@ el all these cro@@ ws , which lab@@ ori@@ ze at the fruit in the garden of my head .
from af@@ ar , I still hear them cry &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cri@@ es appear , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the colour of per@@ dition , until I saw the yellow light that presented to us the hor@@ ror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; don@@ ner , &quot; all@@ usion to 13th Sh@@ ure of the Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the secret was v@@ ented : to protect the state security against us and to prevent the betra@@ yer and the terrorists in us , they speak in the Alban@@ ian dial@@ ect - so they played their denom@@ in@@ ational black@@ out card and betra@@ yed the narrow focus of their world view .
this is not a house here , this is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the crimin@@ als of their cl@@ ans into a hero .
I super@@ vise the audi@@ torium and meet on Abu I@@ mad , a slim and stock@@ y man ; at least he seems to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions that slip it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join these day edi@@ ts and protest on demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have used it to me not to answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t say exactly when ins@@ ults and b@@ lows have become an ordinary communication tool after a friendly conversation .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
any voice in me said that I had to get used to being pun@@ ished , even though I had done nothing to earn this punishment .
in punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; conf@@ ession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably origin@@ ates from the clo@@ aks .
your guard will be delighted with your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with him , and you cannot keep your cri@@ es back .
my scre@@ ams didn &apos;t like it enough , which is why they replaced the tube by a cable .
during my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had once worked as a gar@@ bage collector or whether it belonged to the normal work equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables to give us the opportunity to present a great invention of a giant cable from their point of view .
within a single hour three of them changed , while I was still in the row .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped to cry .
the exec@@ ution@@ er re@@ marked the cooling and didn &apos;t find any favour , which is why he was next to an electri@@ cally charged staff .
electricity fed all my body , enough to store my entire neighborhood .
my half @-@ naked body lying stretched out on the floor was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to lay down again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours passed , which happened to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ass@@ fu@@ ker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted yo@@ ung@@ ster : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father has to worry terri@@ bly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and walk away , you will be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian r@@ apper E@@ ms@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
E@@ ms@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigar@@ ette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
E@@ ms@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he sli@@ ps to his screen , sometimes to his computer , and again to his couch .
but what you can rely on is a cigar@@ ette between his fingers or his with ni@@ cot@@ ine st@@ ained lips .
he lives in the highest level of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family was forced to flee from their village in Palestine where they had lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ a ( about : farmers ) .
for six years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who opposed the conservative majority and ques@@ tioned their old opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ es@@ eed music .
with his music , which often deals with issues such as ori@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues are not only found in his hom@@ etown Am@@ man Rel@@ ev@@ anz , but also in cities that range from Damascus to Syria to far as far as San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited by limits in his thinking and can sympath@@ ise with the people who suffer from the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even though he does not openly admit it , he h@@ orts a special incl@@ ination against US foreign policy .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones , has something to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees of the second generation &quot; - he calls himself even though he was born in Jordan , and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says H@@ d@@ ai@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that because I am a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while in water he sho@@ ok Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ ad@@ an ; at this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ ad@@ an is illegal .
obviously H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee in a sens@@ ational hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the qu@@ acks of lu@@ k@@ ew@@ arm coffee and the thres@@ hing of the K@@ ent cigar@@ ette in the nose speak primarily of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open air , especially when one thro@@ ws a look into neighbouring countries .
therefore it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ ad@@ an - to drink water - not to land in j@@ ail .
recently , the Ministry of Interior of Jordan did a show of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time .
some parliament@@ arians who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual fron@@ ts@@ hip Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contradi@@ cts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert .
the de@@ pu@@ ties and former press spokes@@ persons in the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert was cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer .
many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which poses the proven legitim@@ acy of author@@ it@@ arian regimes throughout the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; who continue to use &quot; for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement probably should not be simply sil@@ ky rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic , but actually reflecting a clear and clear reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b brought traditional line@@ age to Lei@@ be by depic@@ ting his vision of the fate of Arab women who have mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a manifest unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those they should actually trust .
over the past few years , the number of &apos; volunteers &apos; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of volunteers in 2016 reached its peak ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan is missing the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence to support appropriate ways .
according to a law of crime against crime in 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of in@@ house @-@ friendly violence can be det@@ ained at an in@@ definite time in prison , &quot; and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucr@@ atic expenditure as well as the guarantee on the part of the family that the woman will not do anything .
also H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is known not to shy away from issues that have long been tab@@ oo in his country .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b den@@ ies that his work is politically , adm@@ its that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression of opinion , cannot separate from politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have become a policy of politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b attacks the question of the Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are political at the core can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b released a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse repe@@ ats itself often :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the further course of the song H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where you can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ gen@@ eity or homosexu@@ ality .
he not@@ ices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay people and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals have been heavily c@@ ens@@ ored up until 2014 .
in 2014 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya to remember that his comments were torn from the context , twi@@ sted and his opinion had been c@@ ens@@ ored .
&quot; on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts , but was only a edited version , &quot; he says .
today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is openly campaig@@ ning for the Arabic LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als does not correspond to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ is , a poet of the eighth century , who has remained in memory today thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poems .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks itself : if Abu Nu@@ is , who should later work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans do that ?
the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the Is@@ sach@@ ar kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian news service formally adopted several former government members and members of the Teacher &apos;s Association , with the reason that they have vo@@ iced cri@@ tically to the problems related to the corruption that deeply rooted in the country .
in view of this , the H@@ d@@ ai@@ b concert is only the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him , progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - so it sees H@@ d@@ ai@@ b - consists of slow , thou@@ ght@@ ful and inner changes . it is certain that these changes take place every day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
in the end , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b dreams , like millions of other Arab@@ s , from a Arab world without interventions from abroad .
he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of experiencing &quot; it . &quot;
perhaps the region will be approached by music , art and literature on a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bom@@ bs , stre@@ aming and arti@@ fici@@ ally managed democr@@ acies . at least he hopes that .
until this time , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue to coat further and therefore also resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant war@@ rior pupp@@ ets are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ ula festival .
one assumes that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually celebrated in many parts of To@@ ho@@ cus in August . another theory states that the wag@@ ons , the drums and dancing over more than a thousand years have been handed over and come from a time in the armies from the west of Japan to the northeast mar@@ ched to force the Indi@@ genous inhabitants of the region , the emis@@ hi to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
one can hardly imagine how big these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time now : two wag@@ ons are just to be seen .
nevertheless for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and yet another stunning way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer@@ festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ uch@@ a@@ festival .
the view of an 18 @-@ metre @-@ high fixed car was incredible .

young Peru@@ ans exchange weapons against sc@@ iss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

rarely , outer appearance and body care were as important as in this story , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth out of the crimin@@ ality and promote a legitimate occupation like that of the hair@@ dres@@ ser .
El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street smoking and illegal drug trade are common@@ place .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
at the same time Peru experiences - like many other medi@@ um@@ - and South American countries - a rising demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , appearance and therefore also the fancy sty@@ ling of famous sport@@ s@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) has led to the fact that more and more normal citizens embar@@ k on the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
experts meet each other to show who of them can create the most ec@@ cent@@ ric look , as can be seen in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school Augu@@ sto Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and get an apprentic@@ eship in the hair@@ dressing art instead of bad advice , which allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a profession that is currently in fashion .
prior to the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and talked about some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because we have built up this educational association for love with the children .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Love messages to Guer@@ ill@@ ak@@ ämp@@ fer &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve published . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write a letter to love for people we know ?
is it not much more important to accommodate people who feel exp@@ elled ?
precisely this question left the young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ ár@@ rag@@ a from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ as por la Rec@@ on@@ cili@@ ación ( letters for reconciliation ) , which encouraged young people to write gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
only recently their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the gu@@ err@@ illa de@@ fle@@ ction FAR@@ C ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces of Colombia ) , which forms the key point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
internationally the sig@@ nat@@ ory of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
in front of the Colom@@ bi@@ ans , however , there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace .
gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , who have lived in illegal camps for many years , were exposed to war rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic and have been carrying out their weapons around the clock , must now be integrated into the lives of civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , in turn , has become ac@@ custom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards gu@@ er@@ illa fighters , must now take them into their ranks and support them in building a new life .
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bian joined together and had to help with the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former gu@@ err@@ illa figh@@ ter - to be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as Inspiration for the Camp@@ aig@@ n
the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose on the world summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ istian had the opportunity to talk briefly to K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ th@@ i , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
he explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more unnecessary .
he plans to share his love with people this year who needed the most urgent response .
thus the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FAR@@ C , who now find their place in society and build up a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
so far , more than 2000 letters have been collected within the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region .
a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ i@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the City Government of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from Bog@@ ot@@ Art Foundation traveled to the camp to personally transfer the letters .
the FAR@@ C members set themselves as they had done before to accept the orders of their leaders .
but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s unbeliev@@ able how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies in between , &quot; the policy @-@ student Manuela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z Av@@ ila told later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former figh@@ ter led me through the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters camp .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters live ) I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa figh@@ ter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go in , because beside him on the bed a M@@ GL Gar@@ net was lying , a deadly weapon in Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to him anyway and asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hello , what do they just do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer for a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; never in my life somebody has written something so beautiful , so I answer them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I suddenly ran the tears over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I embrac@@ ed him completely and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
perhaps he was tired of war , was tired of being the faithful companions of this figh@@ ter , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected something else from life than war . to join the FAR@@ C was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers from the Hung@@ er@@ to@@ d . &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside , waiting for us with open arms .
until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices and voices
at the beginning students and some leaders of the FAR@@ C gathered for a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as early as war and the FAR@@ C already acted in secret .
that is why the FAR@@ C leaders explained the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave an insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injus@@ tice on the part of the state worked on the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can help shape society in this country more just .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the goal of this magn@@ itude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
hearing these people who had never heard hearing and had no suff@@ rage , and to realize that people , whom I often saw as a monster and even hate , were also only people with beautiful feelings , who were turned around by their living conditions and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives is hur@@ ting me .
but it comforts me that all people - even those killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters have answered the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of the city of Cal@@ i , following letter :
the Colom@@ bian was proph@@ esi@@ ed that peace would rule after dis@@ ar@@ ming .
but this is not the case .
as long as it gives ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people willing to resort to arms , to stand up and protest for their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) .
we of the FAR@@ C now focus on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology belong to it - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , do our contribution and bring sacrifice , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

homosexu@@ als and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers , including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with hor@@ ror activists have witnessed the reporting of the past few months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that hang@@ s like a D@@ amo@@ is worth over the LG@@ BT@@ Q community does not come into existence only overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the republic .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q regulation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines several months ago after reports have been published that addressed the wor@@ sen@@ ing , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who arrested susp@@ icious que@@ er men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
since her childhood she felt that she was actually a woman .
when she was grown up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , so she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had experienced of the gender ine@@ quality of their coun@@ s@@ woman , the hunt was opened at Sab@@ rina .
from fear of her life she moved to the USA .
Sab@@ rina : I was a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organization .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Dag@@ est@@ an , a woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while trying to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread her everywhere on the internet , with my telephone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there is no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can eliminate these shame ? &quot;
after that the photos of my documents made the round by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
I was attacked on 10 October 2015 .
when I was in the process of high@@ lighting a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a bug voice saying : &quot; here &apos;s a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but nothing hurt me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you honor the family , you sc@@ and@@ fle@@ ck ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I just know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and awak@@ ened the last end in the hospital again .
apparently , some women had got everything and started to scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had launched an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two key@@ rings in my right lung .
OC Media : in which nursing staff were you laid - in which the men or women of the women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and laid me up to the women .
I am very grateful for that .
when I read his name for the first time on his office , I got to do it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for having handled with me resp@@ ect@@ fully .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I got threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , stran@@ gers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
they asked me to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all was a lie .
they asked absurd demands : some told me that I had to prove it by going through the streets without going through the streets ; others wanted me to appear in the official TV in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was bad speech and Photos@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what should I have said on TV ?
OC Media : how has your family tried to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some elderly people once talked to my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world that has not only humili@@ ated your family , but the entire Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she put a rope around her neck .
fortunately the neighbours came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window stood a car with a dark@@ ened window pan@@ es and a number plate with a 95 .
after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was a bit la@@ zy .
my human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to award their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help I left the country , but then something unbeliev@@ able .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived .
I bought them without regi@@ stering me , without a passport , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the gar@@ bage .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t believe , you would be safe , just because you left the country ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
our people know in which hotel you are stuck . you even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about gender ine@@ quality , this is a tab@@ oo subject .
some traditionally Cau@@ c@@ asi@@ an elements I still carry in myself .
as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this mental barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt her .
when we chat with camera , I really care how the person looks at which she rec@@ alls from her past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who have stayed there ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
for me , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who sat in a gun for one and a half months .
he told us that during Ram@@ ad@@ an , no people were arrested and tort@@ ured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an could hardly wait , and he did not lock a new wave .
most likely they will focus on family and relatives .
in this way , I mean , they probably load the relatives , they take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has been experienced by blood &apos;s satisfaction .
OC Media : are gay men still held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there wouldn &apos;t be so many .
if , then , especially those who have no weal@@ thy relatives or who were dro@@ w@@ ned by their relatives in order to face Kad@@ y@@ rows &apos;s judgment .
as far as I know , they are held there so that one can later present them as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should they be killed , they will show their bodies on TV and pret@@ end that they would have attacked some village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply gone but specifically di@@ pped in order to radic@@ alise themselves .
OC Media : is that only a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was det@@ ained in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people in this prison have disappeared after their be@@ ard has grown .
there has been nothing new since then .
they simply took it along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , that person was when these people were taken .
up to now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , there were no reports about it yet . however , we susp@@ ect that such actions are possible .
why otherwise would it not have allowed these people to s@@ have ?
do you know whether these persec@@ utions and ab@@ ductions of people , who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , have already occurred in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always carried my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known in Gros@@ ny , when I still lived there - and I never had any problems .
in the grave !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I had never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; originally Russia wanted to introduce us to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civili@@ sation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my eyeb@@ rows were hat@@ ched ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes , bore tube je@@ ans and short tops .
the security ministry of Sh@@ aria has never crossed my hair .
in front of the Russian Theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several ben@@ ches stood , and the whole town knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we were never off@@ ended .
in the Che@@ chen language , there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Sp@@ ent not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
you often say it to children if they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they simply closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never off@@ ended me , never hun@@ ted and never sm@@ itten .
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sab@@ rina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ rov stepped on the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began speaking on TV about mor@@ als .
he did not talk about us per se , but primarily about the behaviour of women .
nevertheless , one could feel how people began to change in the city .
those who had laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before , watched you at once with sus@@ pic@@ ion .
in the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the republic was steadily worse .
OC Media : what kind of activity do you do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize Te@@ ac@@ re@@ ff , summar@@ ies , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards .
I have no p@@ enny for it .
I have discovered these people myself when I cl@@ apped refuge .
I am Muslim and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that is sil@@ ly .
this is the nature , which has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to proph@@ esy with foam in front of the mouth that there are no bo@@ b@@ bin@@ s with them .
the Dag@@ est@@ ans have who , the Cab@@ ard@@ ins have who , the Russi@@ ans have also what ; on the whole planet they have - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it is un@@ comfortable to hear anything .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ ad@@ an - live with men .
you know many think on men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different kinds of sensation to be exact , different life settings .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry that I will be so personally here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups war@@ n against an increase of su@@ icide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian ancest@@ or region suff@@ ers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the domestic Arab population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the last few months there has been a strong increase in su@@ icide . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August revers@@ ed the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is marked by poverty and unemployment , into the li@@ mel@@ ight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he ashamed for his own hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness to be able to pay the in@@ ability for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and want to remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had kind@@ led himself .
some people quickly managed to ext@@ ingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ hani hospital in the town of Ah@@ met .
according to local sources , the bur@@ ns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more .
he died a little while later .
it was not the only su@@ icide which happened in August within the Arabic ancest@@ ral minority , and activists war@@ n on the spot that more men could take life .
the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights stated that this month some other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sh@@ ah@@ ab B@@ ani Tam@@ im - hang@@ ed .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family @-@ fathers who felt hel@@ pl@@ ess and in@@ capable of nour@@ ishing their families and to pursue a safe work because of the persecution of the Iranian government .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , in which a large majority of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i living in Iran , has been sh@@ aken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to contest their living .
a century ago , the Arabic ancest@@ or was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ahl@@ avi mon@@ archy took power and in 1925 great efforts took to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran , as well as some of the rich@@ est and most valuable commercial areas for the Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the native population receives little from this wealth .
it is often victims of untreated disease , hunger and priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime systematically den@@ ies Ah@@ mad Arab@@ s jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government also built a variety of dem@@ ons , which re@@ direct water from the Arab territories into the Persi@@ an territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie .
these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industries .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ ha@@ w@@ zi youth increased to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director for co@@ oper@@ atives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who are looking for a job , completed primary school , completed 55 % a secondary school and have completed 45 % a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the mind of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ mad human rights activ@@ ist , resi@@ ding in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mix of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of su@@ icide among young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men .
for this reason , a combination of a high number of ethnic Persi@@ ans and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the creation process is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persi@@ ans and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the creation process :
as function@@ aries and institutions do not prefer Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i is depri@@ ved of access to job opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arab@@ s and force them to earn their living outside their homeland of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their name and sur@@ name to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , as even Arab names are not toler@@ ated at the workplace , let alone the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes .
in view of the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i must end@@ ure , human rights activists propose alarm before the situation is explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world will wake up and take note of it .
the main reason for su@@ icide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and su@@ icide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I don &apos;t identify myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women react - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we should generally be femin@@ ist .
for example , nowadays women still earn less money despite the same education as men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later come across a glass ceiling in various areas of life , and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced and I suffer twice and triple below .
I am a black woman .
and yet : when I come to talk on skin colour , on black women &apos;s black women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention the kind we have been ab@@ used physically , mentally and verb@@ ally , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists decided to keep silent about femin@@ ists .
however , all agree that women - all women - should come together to lift up their voices and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my Lord &apos; to sing &apos; to achieve equality ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexu@@ alized violence there is an institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist motiv@@ ating violence that we are exposed to black women in tw@@ o@@ fold ways .
or that black women and women of other ethnic and country of origin are less worthy than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background more often referred to the school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as white women .
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t join a movement as black woman , in whose centre the white woman stands , who ref@@ uses to take into account injus@@ ti@@ ces in her mind , which refer both to the sex and the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a femin@@ ist @-@ femin@@ ist sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women .
So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained in her speech in 18@@ 51 : &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; and I too refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a fear@@ ful and margin@@ alised being in the historic sense .
I refuse to join group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropri@@ ation to advance its eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c program .
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of over@@ l@@ apping skin color and gender . for some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them for a better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and to excl@@ ude themselves from white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name .
I prefer to release myself fully and entirely from femin@@ ism and call me to the movement of the W@@ om@@ an@@ ismus , which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of advoc@@ ating me for a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradig@@ m that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women to us according to our own ideas and go into the spheres created by us for us .
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book of Afri@@ cana wom@@ an@@ - ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ismus : how we can defend ourselves ) tells us that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be wor@@ shipped , which constitute the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can up@@ lift black women and women of other cultures because in this paradig@@ m I exist .
I will be recognized as a part of this paradig@@ m because of my dark skin and my existence as a woman .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment in which my life has not passed , nor ignored , nor rejected .
p@@ addle against pollution : the man &apos;s mission to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine , which reports on international efforts to solve environmental problems .
as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published again .
once again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled throughout the last 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special concern of the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship to the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church .
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river that we lost when I was still a kid , &quot; Mus@@ a tells .
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization of Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance , which is committed to protecting the rivers , streams , and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video Mus@@ a summar@@ izes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water any more , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was fil@@ med and published for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , in Iraq @-@ based document@@ aries and multimedia journ@@ alism .
the focus of her work lies on tracing , little not@@ ewor@@ thy sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative video and multimedia techniques , with their help supp@@ ressed congregations to tell their stories in their own way .
Paraguay women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The women who we@@ ep &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on the women &apos;s mur@@ ders in the country and in the region and show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the short@@ ened and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Ag@@ ainst Women in Paraguay &quot; by Kur@@ structural . the article is part of the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ ght@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) reported on the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex@@ partner , who had become violent towards violence .
since the end of their relationship , some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put into action , but more could not be done .
when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena because of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , the display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez did nothing .
a few days later , the second woman pulled her ad back .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
when women ref@@ rain at all , they generally receive no support from the State .
in many cases women are also financi@@ ally dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence can be reported to the law enforcement authorities .
content 1 Stri@@ ke and Statisti@@ cal 2 In@@ visible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a judicial system , which is nothing sub@@ ni@@ mb@@ 3 Cor@@ respon@@ dence laws : good approach , lack of implementation pun@@ ches and statistics
it is difficult to see how many women are really ab@@ used , says My@@ cen@@ sus Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender questions at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social science research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are several statements and reports , which do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
however , the figures available are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , 9@@ 600 ads were indic@@ ted for domestic violence . 70 % of them were violence against women .
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5,000 ads because of domestic violence in the peace courses . 86 % of the adver@@ ts of women came here .
in the ads , 40 % of women said that they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ian women &apos;s minister Ana Bai@@ ardi , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; on every woman who is sh@@ ad@@ owed in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on every woman who is sh@@ ad@@ owed due to physical abuse , there are two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the genocide in Paraguay is not a criminal off@@ ence , the law enforcement authorities cannot adequ@@ ately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until August 2016 , journalists included at least 12 cases of genocide in the country .
the Co@@ ordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay , every ten days dies a woman due to violence by men .

invisible abuse and a legal system that takes nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm girl@@ friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want it , but then still gave up .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos . but for two years she inher@@ ited the psych@@ ic power - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe :
I never thought I would be a victim of abuse .
when I read about it , I always thought that only women have happened that are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they let themselves be dec@@ eived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment of Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ically , if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why she had fallen out of Carlos for so long and didn &apos;t leave him before .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that the victims of abuse would at least have a certain complic@@ ity .
Victoria Santos , who is not from Paraguay , fought for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner interfer@@ ed with her .
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe dir &quot; ) that consists of women who are all victims of abuse .
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the testimon@@ ies seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything began with mental abuse .
her weal@@ thier partner eventually even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria &apos;s ads with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , they did not receive any support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she led a trial against her former partner who developed into an im@@ meas@@ urable legal battle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ays law : good approach , in@@ adequate implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not applied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a path of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria Santos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , also sees major problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a draft bill was deb@@ ated at the Par@@ agu@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # für@@ st ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this h@@ ash@@ tag and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement are part of a Twitter campaign sponsored by Am@@ ne@@ sty International . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the original draft of the law fores@@ ees to explain Fem@@ dom@@ i to an independent off@@ ence and to pun@@ ish har@@ sh@@ er as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the legislative text was changed in some respects , so as to win the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law that feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions is denied that are generally b@@ anned in Paraguay and will be pun@@ ished with up to five years imprisonment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the original bill had fores@@ een the majority of the ( bureaucr@@ atic and economic ) process costs , which must bear the victims of violence at present , if they simply ref@@ rain from issu@@ ing and obtaining a secure accommodation to the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legisl@@ ature does not provide sufficient financial resources for it :
in Paraguay , abuse is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
here , a re@@ thinking must take place , so that violence is no longer regarded as normal .
those who are silent in view of these facts are complic@@ it and contribute to the perpet@@ rat@@ ors of perpet@@ rat@@ ors .
we have to refund so long until mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is no longer considered normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ an sen@@ ate . prior to that , parts of the law were changed . among other things , a passage was cancelled , which the partners in cases of domestic violence called for reconciliation .
the opinions about the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the string of words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from parts of the law , however , is considered a great set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media in Oman a year after b@@ anning a newspaper continues to attack attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was closed on the website of the forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than a year ago , the US authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking Az@@ am@@ n newspaper because of its reporting on corruption in the sult@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he is serving a one @-@ year sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and brought to trial , but later released .
Oman has been governed by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid in 1970 , who came to power after he had dismis@@ sed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn T@@ aim@@ ur , by a coup d &apos;@@ é@@ tat .
since then , he has been clo@@ thed in addition to his role as the only sult@@ an , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Defence , Foreign Minister , President of the Supreme Council for the Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the rule of the Sult@@ an is characterised by the per@@ sever@@ ing efforts of security forces , especially domestic sec@@ rec@@ y , public liber@@ ties , including press freedom , to restri@@ ct and torture human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities systematically restri@@ ct peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights , including activists to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper published since its inc@@ eption in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute mon@@ archy ) until it was b@@ anned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties binding hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary &quot; on July 26 , 2016 . it was about corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary and the interference of senior officials in court decisions .
in the report government officials were accused of having pres@@ sured the Supreme Court judge in Oman to susp@@ end a judgment in a dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of 26 July 2016 with a report on the title page entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; High @-@ ranking parties tie hands of justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a member of the editorial committee , was charged by the ISS and arrested on his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS was appointed dep@@ uty editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
the paper was closed at an in@@ definite time after the inform@@ ing minister had given the statement that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper is prohibited , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i took place before the trial in Mas@@ at .
the Court condemned the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convic@@ ted , among other things , because of distur@@ b@@ ance of the public order , &quot; abuse of the internet &quot; and &quot; supp@@ ression of the state . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty on the violation of a ban on public@@ ity and s@@ lander .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . moreover , a one @-@ year vocational prohibition was imposed against the two journalists .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 ri@@ al ( 2,@@ 600 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network to distribute material that could pose a danger to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a damage deposit of 5,000 om@@ ani ri@@ al ( $ 13 000 ) was set and it was released on 22 August 2016 before the pron@@ oun@@ cement of the sentence .
the App@@ eals Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 following the arrest of his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he served his one @-@ year sentence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the App@@ eals Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the decision of the Court to rel@@ inqu@@ ish Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper is still exposed to attacks by the government .
on 8 January , the Information Minister issued an order with which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information received a further instruction in person , in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and with which the Minister announced another time against the decision of the Court of App@@ eal to re@@ plen@@ ish the publication of the newspaper .
the ongoing shut@@ down of az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where the freedom of the press was viol@@ ated in recent years .
further injuries include the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation .
due to the continuing closure of az@@ am@@ n and the det@@ ention of the journalist al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression is that the US authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of press freedom .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the US authorities to :
1 . let You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j free and un@@ condi@@ tionally release ;
2. creating a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3. to protect press freedom in the country and
4 . in all circumstances to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman put their right human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of re@@ pris@@ als , including judicial ch@@ ic@@ ans .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers etc . ) in the Gulf region and adjacent states by promoting the freedom of expression and freedom of association , and the right to gather peac@@ efully together and offer them protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , Fig@@ ure takes place with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely or even mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
for the need for medical research carried out on site , there are two reasons : on the one hand , many medicines and vacc@@ ines are missing in the offer of the global health care system , which cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have a far more serious impact in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and missing investment for resear@@ ching these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem .
second , research , which is carried out by African scientists , helps build up its own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of Center for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed first serious impacts on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post @-@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched on the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ic health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( dis@@ claimer : Dr. War@@ rier talks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ ba national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I just started a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens .
GM : what do you think about the most important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we only employ solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
that has to change , otherwise we will always stay recei@@ vers instead of being makers .
the solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GM : where does the funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult it is to find suitable scientists for projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or to come here , because the financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
GM : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work you didn &apos;t have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure doesn &apos;t meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GM : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , research of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and inf@@ ectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GM : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as a scientist in Africa against Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : often , it is the limited speed to do things , and the terri@@ fic access to scientific expertise that pose challenges here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system that magazines can only make articles accessible for payment ( the so @-@ called Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this contribution by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine reported on solutions for environmental problems around the world .
Frank Mort@@ on has been bred in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 sorts , such as Out@@ law , the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NA@@ SA @-@ A@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
almost 20 years Mort@@ on &apos;s work was limited only by his own resour@@ c@@ ef@@ ul@@ ness and the question of how many species he can get , limits set .
but at the beginning of the 2000@@ s he noticed that more and more sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not continue to use them further .
the patents protect not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or curved leaves .
over the past few years more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cer@@ eals or cart@@ els . due to this trend , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts in food safety are concerned about the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of old tradition , Mort@@ on always bre@@ eds let@@ tu@@ ce , but it takes longer , because his work is more and more difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if in a river a bou@@ lder is lying to which I have to d@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do that now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that these patents go too far on sal@@ ads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand before judgment , no one can breed a new type of sal@@ ads , because all features are already patented . &quot; it makes it as good as possible and tries to breed the features he wants .
however , he is very careful and stri@@ ves to use no material that is protected as intellectual property .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the US and around the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bre@@ edings ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the ISS &quot; International Space Station have bred and eaten red red@@ dish at the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station . there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coinci@@ dence that this name sounds rather like that the movement from the IT sector origin@@ ates rather than from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; open source &quot; seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to cop@@ yri@@ ghted software .
it has been established to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can thus be used for plant bre@@ eders .
as part of the initiative called O@@ SS@@ I , US bre@@ eders can ple@@ dge to freely use the seeds bred by them .
however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eders only allow others who buy seeds , to breed it in order to breed their own varieties , and not to se@@ w them immediately - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
at the University of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ SS@@ I Management Board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , Professor of Wis@@ cons@@ in @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ SS@@ I Management Board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are both important for food safety and environmental protection .
seeds therefore play a role in greater contex@@ ts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would attempt to use the latter not or only little by bre@@ aching seeds with natural resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stres@@ ses that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement is not concerned with gene@@ tically modified plants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seeds , &quot; says he and takes on the increasingly frequent f@@ usions in the global agriculture industry , whose recent examples include the mer@@ gers of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Bayer , which , for example , is offered on farmers markets , should also know that the way that vegetables is bred is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty is not possible without food sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed initiative are committed to helping others to continue their seeds freely . in contrast , their approach is to patent seed and plant features .

Os@@ si supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered as the available gene pool due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always available , inc@@ ess@@ antly shrink .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of the O@@ SS@@ I , employs herself in her doc@@ torate with genetic variation in car@@ r@@ ots and their availability . she found out that about one third of all anti@@ trust features are protected as intellectual property , making it impossible for plant bre@@ eders to be used either at all or only difficult .
for other plants , such estimates do not exist yet , but experts such as Lu@@ by suggest that plants are patented as wheat in even greater style than salad or car@@ r@@ ots .
a question of view
plants are bred in such a way that they have specifically desired characteristics - from those by which their tastes or their color improve until such , because of which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material is decre@@ asing for bre@@ eders by becoming more and more patents . genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse predic@@ table by climate change .
in an e @-@ mail Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spe@@ aker Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ uto ackno@@ wle@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture , the company advoc@@ ates the preservation of genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it contradi@@ cts the view that intellectual property has other bre@@ eders , since &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent ex@@ pi@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method .
such protection does not in@@ hi@@ bit innovation , but encourages them by providing more material and expertise to the public . &quot;
Mort@@ on sees that differently : to wait for 20 years until a patent exp@@ ires , surely does not promote innovation .
and if you have to wait for so long to breed with plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one would have already lost the fight .
however , the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive for us .
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us , and it is impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in all , Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept of patented plant features : &quot; we do not really create the characteristics themselves .
the plants form them themselves and as bre@@ eders , we finally have no idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Car@@ ol Dep@@ pe , plant bre@@ eder in the US state O@@ reg@@ on and O@@ SS@@ I board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who bre@@ eds one species , also bre@@ eds its own values into it .
whoever believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for their cultivation , her@@ b@@ ici@@ des are needed , which bre@@ eds in its varieties this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exact opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than e.g. Mon@@ san@@ to ) patents have patents , they manage to survive the most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they reject the pat@@ enting or they hold it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case .
the independent plant bre@@ eder Frank Mort@@ on is looking for sal@@ ads in his breeding garden .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mort@@ on also believes that bre@@ eders would be more innovative because of the avo@@ idance of plant patents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that patented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I constantly need new material for my catalogue , because I know that my competitors are selling my varieties themselves in a few years &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a patent for 20 years it is protected from competition , which makes it quite easy in my opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worldwide resonance &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; although the US seems to be a leader in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the area of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed programme . to preserve seeds of traditional crops , the Centre is working together with farmers and helps them to grow new varieties that meet certain requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Organisation Agre@@ col is working on an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license which is ultimately a more formal and legally binding form of O@@ SS@@ I commitment to bre@@ eders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( regulations governing the bre@@ eder differ from country to country , where the O@@ SS@@ I obligation cannot simply be taken one to one in Europe or in other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , states that conventional bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it appe@@ als against the current practice of the European Patent Office which allows patents on con@@ ven@@ tionally bred plants .
one explanation , however , is not a law ; now it is to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ vos organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives from governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards the pat@@ enting of seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ vos &apos;s program for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , for which scheduled next year the official starting signal should fall .
a merger of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ vos , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on ero@@ sion , technology and concentration - Action Group on E@@ rosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has put together a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a report . this represents the opinion that farmers have the opportunity to come to seeds , to exchange and improve seed policy to ensure a stable supply of food .
the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection to the Lu@@ by of O@@ SS@@ I hopes that more people will soon be recognized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and organic food is particularly focused on where and how something is cultivated , and seed systems have hardly played a role in doing so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now try to make people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the newest goals of c@@ ens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still block content on the internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of 5 August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports on sel@@ fl@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in August , the network published a position on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ised this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains - despite this attack and the mo@@ cking of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities which should defend the law , to expose the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it was never as important as now .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first licensed website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites over two months , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , arab@@ ic @-@ language edition of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era &apos;s Qatar @-@ based network for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of web @-@ side blocking . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the main sources of human rights in Arab language htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
besides AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada made use of his blog for the distribution of articles and articles , which he writes in@@ accessible websites and media for Egypt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the blog , which he established to circum@@ vent the c@@ ens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , was itself the aim of an attack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Blogger , the provider on which Zi@@ adas blog is located , on the other hand , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video how the police exercis@@ ed physical violence against two students .
his articles revol@@ ve mainly about politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment Zi@@ ada said to the government and reflected what this means for him :
the blo@@ gs to block is very old but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blocking of the blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) It has succeeded in communicating with me the feeling of a si@@ ege @-@ condition ; a arrest , an attempted murder , an invitation to the National Security Council , the blocking blo@@ gs as well as any other web page for which I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words : my words have influence , if only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it for the post of articles to circum@@ vent the c@@ ens@@ orship .
but now , having blocked it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the cour@@ ageous go the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities closed from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites . these were technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and Eti@@ sal@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the locking of providers , which was possible by re @-@ h@@ itting the intern@@ net and private surf , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12th we noticed how the block of web pages that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer began .
such a practice points to the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content that could have access to Egyptian users .
the situation is additionally exac@@ erb@@ ated by the fact that the decision @-@ making decisions are taken behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis , with which it can proceed in court against these actions .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government willing to go to c@@ ens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Jan@@ eiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .
the Brazilian Army is in use in the fav@@ elas in N@@ iter@@ ó@@ i , a town in the state of Rio de Jan@@ eiro , during the government crisis .

day after day newspapers report in Brazil with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Jan@@ eiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motives .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ very second day a police officer in Rio de Jan@@ eiro is murdered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thi@@ eves rob@@ bed the pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Navy and Air Force to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio in 2017 reached the highest level for 10 years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice even called upon the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports like these have become common@@ place and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least find the manager of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio on August 16 published the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which she announced to set up a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision explained the newspaper so :
extra will continue to report about crimes committed in every major city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . all , however , what happens in Rio is published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way of calling : this is not normal !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the only alternative , so that we as journalists do not close our eyes from cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a four minute video shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper stated that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
it is probably the only newspaper in the whole world with a ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that does not recognise the war at all .
in the same video a journalist of the newspaper explains that , according to the Institute of Internal Security , there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organizations .
in the editorial , the newspaper writes :
we are aware that a war discourse , when it is dist@@ orted , can also be used to cover the atro@@ cities of the police , which only sho@@ ots and then asks questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Maf@@ ia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
in an article on the news portal The inter@@ cept Brasil , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oliv@@ eira ar@@ gues against den@@ ying violence as a &quot; war . &quot;
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ suffici@@ ency of public service .
to remember : the state of Rio de Jan@@ eiro is larger than its capital .

Rio de Jan@@ eiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil &quot; is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil lie according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date data .
none of these cities are located in the federal state of Rio de Jan@@ eiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ ates per federal state , Rio is on No.@@ 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the Glob@@ o company , the largest media enterprise in South America , which , as Cec@@ í@@ lia empha@@ sizes , has been repe@@ ating the State &apos;s security policy for years .
this security policy was also part of the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit imposed by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer a fav@@ ela by using a massive police station and permanently station@@ ed a unit there .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . however , for several years , after several reports , the U@@ PP , after several reports of ch@@ ic@@ ans and re@@ pression against the poor communities , which was supposed to protect the newly created police unit , was increasingly under attack .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux made from one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war draws serious consequences for the people .
this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civilian is an un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; crazy spheres . &quot;
war or her , fact is that the residents of the fav@@ elas continue to suffer in Rio .
one week it is now that the police en@@ kl@@ ed the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident made head@@ lines : a fruit sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots that the police had fired from a helicop@@ ter .

to stay alive : teach Syri@@ ans to plant fung@@ i
scre@@ enshot from the Advertising video .
source : Can@@ do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops .
according to Siege Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around a million Syri@@ ans in a state of si@@ ege in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib .
the East Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly affected , where an attack on chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition go out on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massac@@ re was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , those areas controlled by rebels have been besi@@ eg@@ ed outside Damascus , which led to the local population to be dependent on locally produced or through tun@@ nels and control points .
through the lon@@ gl@@ asting block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ att@@ ain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian volunteers and acade@@ mics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own fung@@ i as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the common foods planted in Syria and are only extremely rare in the Syrian cuisine . however , they make them an attractive food source for many residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the Direc@@ tly of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we op@@ ted for the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expressed its relief that it now gains more and more &quot; an awareness . &quot;
in order to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian Crow@@ d@@ funding Platform c@@ ando in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to medi@@ ate 125 families knowledge to plant@@ ing fung@@ i , as Dr. Lei@@ la leads to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected goal of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to c@@ ando until Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
due to the fuel short@@ age locally produced plastics are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they started with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of mushrooms from the regions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they reviewed their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . when this was done , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed fung@@ i everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach the people the mushroom @-@ breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : frac@@ ture of the si@@ ege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food resi@@ dues ( such as paper , tea , coffee kit , cart@@ on , etc ) to gain new food .
creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities , which are tied to their home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world , so that our success and our fight against hunger and si@@ ege will be visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experiences to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese calls for justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested in Portugal on October 21st in many districts and demanded justice for the victims of fires that were gr@@ ass@@ ed in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 frac@@ tures spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande took a similar trag@@ edy where 64 deaths and more than 200 injured were injured .
according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors the forest areas via satellite photos alone , approximately 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon region .
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .

the fores@@ e@@ eable trag@@ edy
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people wonder@@ ed why civil protection was not able to restri@@ ct the extent of the trag@@ edy as far as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al from the Bund der farmers of Portugal declared the paper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of open roads surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria a similar trag@@ edy would have happened in June as the streets were locked very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , building permits in places with a high risk of fire are ques@@ tioned .
a far @-@ reaching proposal on the forest @-@ form , which the government had brought into serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed the construction activity from case to case , if the applicant had a means of self @-@ protection - that was an open back@@ door , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val proce@@ eded in the same article from the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organisation Quer@@ cus attracted attention that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of easily fl@@ amm@@ able wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , continue to expand after fires of this species .
these problems are added that the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , as inhabitants , sought information or tried to contact relatives , offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : she used the own civil protection data using the f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt application and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was so crucial in this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the server failed to withstand the rush of 400@@ ,000 users who persec@@ uted the fires . this included the website more than half a million hits .
even the founder asked for help :

the way from the refugee from Afghanistan to a successful entrepren@@ eur

in one night in the fall of 1994 the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Tali@@ ban .
two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n group@@ ings that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan has become a land of terror and desp@@ air .
at the same time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central @-@ Afghanistan for the last time with his family during dinner .
even though his mother did not say so at that time , she knew she would not see her son very long - maybe even more .
in the dawn the boy was supposed to break .
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ g .

Ab@@ du@@ l Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ W@@ ah@@ dat party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Tali@@ ban and suddenly a lot of Haz@@ ara felt safe .
the Tali@@ ban , known for their hatred on the Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself again in Pakistan .
for a couple of years he worked in a coal mine . the work was hard and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his low wages and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and drag@@ ged sacks with mort@@ ars that were he@@ avier than himself , in order to earn his living .
at that time as today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was marked by mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really tough , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af reminded in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site where we also worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no services and no heating there . we hung n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we did not get frozen at night . &quot;
after four years A@@ shar@@ af left his life without Pap@@ iere in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe .
in the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered ship@@ w@@ reck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time A@@ shar@@ af was hom@@ eless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day eating to aid .
it is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high awareness quot@@ as . it is also true that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers have in the country are dis@@ astro@@ us .
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system suff@@ ers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the large majority of asylum seek@@ ers are accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special recording centres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian Law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to an admission center if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can go down for months after registration of the asylum request .
until then , people who don &apos;t have money for accommodation either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ restra@@ ined li@@ fest@@ y@@ les helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
after several years of working in the construction sector , A@@ shar@@ af put his entire savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now the theme of the documentary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behind vene@@ tian luxury - a ha@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by director A@@ min Wa@@ hi@@ di . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the film won the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to the official estimates , around 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transi@@ tional solution on the way to other European countries .
over the past few years , some of Afgh@@ ans have created companies , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of his Restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant deals with the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts the history of their trip to Italy .
Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pad@@ ua the Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a S@@ ushi Restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ an .
A@@ shar@@ af@@ s &apos;s goals however reach far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retail trade and aim back to the country that he had forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where there is a risk , there are also opportunities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happy when I know that my people suffer .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af also for@@ ges plans for opening a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and con@@ serving techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they can sell their crop surplus on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end there is stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this trip itself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this road .

the Egyptian parliament reviews a draft bill that fores@@ ees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after registration with a government authority .
users would have to be able to use social networks to register their full name and ID number within six months after successful law decision on the authority &apos;s website .
anyone missed this step could be sentenced to six months of prison sentence or a penalty of punishment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law , which was applied by six@@ ty members of Parliament , is currently in place with the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May , another member of the Parliament submitted a legislative proposal to be introduced in the tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the alle@@ g@@ ation of the president or a high officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the law proposal , such a de@@ ed , however , would be pun@@ ished with j@@ ail and fin@@ es , as legal experts of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the law is passed , this can mean up to three years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; imprisonment for the condemned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , this would rein@@ force a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger anyway for many years .
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photograph@@ ed Egyptian polic@@ emen , demonstr@@ ating violence against demonstr@@ ators demonstr@@ ating against the military coup that had led to the ten@@ se of elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , just like over 700 Protest@@ ants arrested in the same incident , four years in prison for a trial .
recently his trial was post@@ pon@@ ed on May 20 , because the prison administration failed to bring the accused from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan is threatening the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , e.g. weapons possession , illegal assembly , murder and dam@@ aging murder .
in another case , a criminal court in Giza addressed two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ bar@@ b@@ ary . they were accused of their reporting on the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seats on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ Ad@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pun@@ ish@@ ments of the journalists Ab@@ dul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested at the previously mentioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunis@@ ian activists h@@ ears to cut @-@ through documents
in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform N@@ awa@@ al and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia has been inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ated mainly to a continuous action plan . bes@@ po@@ ke plan comes from the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , expressly supports a controversi@@ al draft law , which would ensure business people and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption accused officials Am@@ ne@@ sty , provided they return all un@@ lawful funds .
the document published on April 21 , published on the N@@ awa@@ at website , sheds light on how the pre @-@ winning plans for the support of the legislation will look like .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia denied the nam@@ ing of his sources under indication of Article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian Press Code , which journalists received the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , at the District Court in Tunis on 9th May , he appeared as a witness in the case .
does China want to force the users of social media to present their identification ?
according to the new provisions of the information offices of the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need a permit before writing or sharing news in social media .
it is also stated in the rules that registration will be required with full real name .
analysts assume that by this the elimination of anonymous comm@@ ent@@ aries within social networks shall be reached . it is still un@@ clear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to only sel@@ ectively en@@ force these regulations to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do we then see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
may the state c@@ ens@@ orship of Russia blocked the access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat has failed to register to the provincial government as the &quot; organis@@ er of information distribution . &quot;
this designation is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government imple@@ ments a list of online services that organize the publication of the information . the law also allows the government to make use of said services for removal of content and to force them on request for the termination of user data .
these websites are currently websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ klass@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .h@@ k , the email service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish Court has blocked Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ordered Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia &apos;s administrators refused to delete two English @-@ speaking articles , the declar@@ ations that Turkey supports the ji@@ ha@@ dist@@ s in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and communication gave the site been locked because it became &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an information source working with groups to encourage political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is thus , among others , China , one of the few countries worldwide , in which access to Wikipedia is not possible .
Britain can &apos;t stop fl@@ aming up
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance restrictions , which would force Internet service providers to monitor communication in real time and install back@@ door programs that encryp@@ t data encryption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the government has consul@@ ted telec@@ om companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside .
despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwar@@ ded to the Ministry of Interior .
