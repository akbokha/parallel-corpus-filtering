<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I have grown up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and operated his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was primarily a journalist because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Brief, a fearless reporter who covered the murderous conspiracy of a oil magnate with the help of Julia Roberts, who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were inclined to his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free after Method One, "I was like that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only intensified.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country I have ever lived, whose diversity is so welcoming that you can always be the one you are and it's easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had written a very tender love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot was written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">In his opinion he never holds behind the mountain, as is said so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afroamerica and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted in pairs for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican preselection was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigotus person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't reconcile Trump and his voters to the people I had met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, which absorbs people from all over the world, a deeply credible person with whom I could talk about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">He did not agree with that of Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I had met with our common love for basketball and we spent a lot of hours watching the "Phoenix Suns."</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps's intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity that I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who spent their lives fighting the environment, and their husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like their son.</seg>
<seg id="26">Still it fits to the engagement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and my colleagues helped to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors who helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those embodied by them deepened my love of America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump made its way to the nominated Republican presidency candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">It turned out however that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps precisely because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The argument with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared his racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things broke me almost the heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to describe the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify people, one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectless and indicates inability to understand those who act and think differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their congregations are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that those voters, most of whom are white, have voted for Trump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might want to say they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commentates the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt on those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "Whitelash" "" "(Apt. d. Ü.: as much as" "" "revolt against all other ethnic" "" "; pun of white in reference to the whites and whiplash, which means as much as Schleudertrauma), as the great Van Jones called, has killed exactly what America has done so great." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which belief or background you may have, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">However, with the election Donald Trumps, there is a vast majority of the white America of this promise and says: hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change in word with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" Mr. Khan asked.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "the crowd answered with a loud" "" "No!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"do Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the crowd roared.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried and their voices became louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "could anyone who is not like you, a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received an unanimous and loud" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded by saying: "thank God, Mr. Trump, this is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country for which his son fell, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps country, said the news.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people that look like Mr. Khan, could not find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="66">From misery to the stars: these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music by rubbish</seg>
<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca together with the children of the paraguac city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">The music played in both places not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill site, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town which is very popular among tourists but worlds apart from the nearby preColumbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now the La banda de música (music bande) plays in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its abuse and abuse of gangs.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth such a rare hope forever.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations to the music group very seriously, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI writes:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">You always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the bustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from trash</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village that is practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with remanufactured instruments made of local solid waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers under the direction of Favio Chávez have started turning parts of the waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments mimic violins, violas, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all made out of the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music by the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local winemaker and music teacher of the children of Cateura, is reminiscent of the early days:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage. the kids didn't know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as a favio something he had never seen before: a violin made out of rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is an orchestra consisting of instruments made of recycled material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) shows the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces about one billion tons of waste every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Fill harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring scenery from garbage to music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played its music in front of Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and team work can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published by Ensia.com, a magazine that purposefully reports on international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-publication is carried out as part of an agreement with Global Voices for the sharing of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa then it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberian waters before it visited the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a criminal of these kinds to their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comes, Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobilised against the ship. they refused to appoint one of their ports and refused to grant him a fishing license.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything," "" "Benedict Kiilu, a senior defendant of the Kenyan fishing authority, is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia due to looting of the fish stocks of the country.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NGO stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal Fisheries stop).</seg>
<seg id="107">In addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that had driven the prime minister from their waters at that time.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "we have eight countries that are like cohesion and work together. they exchange information and stand out where it comes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project provides FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden so that it is extremely difficult to detect. this is the main cause of the overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Due to the deliberate disregard of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing once were hampered by bureaucratic hurdles, and also by the snail-empo, with the information between individual countries, the actions happen in real-time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">For example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news on suspicious activities or details that one noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also pursues the activities of ships very carefully when they move on the open sea, by means of satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to mark ships that fish in forbidden areas. also, such suspicious travel routes can be discovered - such as those that suggest that a ship invites its caught fish on the move to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license, where they were on the move, and possibly also whether they have a criminal agent.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are opposed to illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such vessels in their ports. what does that mean that ships cannot sell their cargo, and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then it's about substantial financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is not worthwhile anymore." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and that is what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, senior director of nfds Africa. the latter is a consulting firm that advocates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to gain an estimated $20 million in lost revenues, which the eight members of the HISH-i network are losing each year because of the illegal fishermen who invade East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries which attract the region of commercial fishing from all over the world. among these illegal fisher.</seg>
<seg id="122">Such actions include actions such as sailing under false flag, falsified license papers, stating fantasies, fishing protected species and fish in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "purposefully exploit the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of an unbridled control system," "" "says Long." "" "previously, a ship could fish illegally and a country could say" "" "You don't want to start my harbour." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me" "". "" "" "and exactly this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i now." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front is working.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 investigations of suspected ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has revealed criminal networks that had distributed falsified licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has been prosecuted and found escaping ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international agency for the fight against crime, FISH-i can divide and receive information on illegal fishing over long distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that should help FISH-i to detect suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, also helps prevent the illegal ships that would like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position. and that's what we try to cross," "" "says Duncan Copeland, boss analyst at trygg Mat Tracking, a NGO that also deals with fisheries data and offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems, so that they can no longer be hosted by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland thus helps build a system that connects different information levels. it should help FISH-i to find criminally acting ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">Yet FISH-i's team of African nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently SkyTruth launched the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Ocean Protection Organization Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and is able to display the position of each tracking ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "join with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - it simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on a global scale." "" "Pew Charitable Trust has a similar project that allows a global system to track ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals but also scare them off.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that were previously exploited without a license and hardly had to reckon with consequences now know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i have now recorded a 33% increase in fisheries turnover, since fishing boats have more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i had helped Somalia to detect Greko 1, the inspectors found tow networks there, whose use was prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now copy other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "we have become a study object." "" "in West Africa several hundred million dollars are disappearing annually by illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">In 2015 six countries have joined forces to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they are also fighting the illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i. "with certainty, the aim is to allow even more such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's latest member country Somalia was able to report its first great triumph: in October, it presented Greko 1, a ship running under false flag. and not only the ship was on the road even without a license and were used by dragging nets that are now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also in forbidden waters, reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "taking measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special, collaborative way of working for the protection of the oceans actually works across the oceans.

<seg id="153">The road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are considered to be a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the dismissal of President Nicolás Maduro.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government of Venezuela had rejected the opposition to a referendum on a referendum, the Venetians reacted in their eyes to negotiate the political and economic crisis of the country into the void of meeting the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (for example: the recovery of Venezuela), pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - among others in the lowland area of Barinas, in the Andes regions of Mérida and Táchira, in the central-north of Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the federal state Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country is steadily deteriorating, which is noticeable in the daily life of the Venezuelans by an acute deficiency of food and drugs.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw a fundamental change in the official release of the current President Nicolás Maduro, but ultimately the posture of a re-election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, contributor to Global Voices in Venezuela, summarizes the context of the government decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">As part of the social, political and economic crisis in which inflation and profits are among the highest in the whole world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% for the annual financial statements) and in which a serious and far-reaching shortage of food and medicine exists, the referendum was considered the only way to give the country a chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance Mesa de la Unidad Democrática or short MUD (about: round table of the Democratic unit), in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces, the protesters called for a mass rally to support the National Assembly, and a march to Miraflores palace, the Venezuelan government seat, was scheduled to continue on 3 November.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter among other things as follows:</seg>

<seg id="177">Particularly large waves struck the news about police repression in the central-north of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">There the protesters went back to the local Cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement in front of the police and armed supporters of the government.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they were able to leave the cathedral safely, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some demonstrators tried to stop police forces, including this woman in the state of Táchira:</seg>

<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic makes the round, which forms the amount of suppression per day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a ministerial commission procedure - it has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of innumerable people on the streets.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview of Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 at Día a Día, an Argentinian news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to watch the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinian town of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano testified at the great La Perla Ribera Process in the province of Cordoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes committed during the Argentinian military dictatorship were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the brush, carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in the prison La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he retained the secret of family secrets.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time I believed that was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child of 15 years, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not see that my father was a thief, torturer and murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis has no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarmeriebeamter. during the Argentinian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of state terrorism, his father was Deputy commander of the secret service department 141 in prison La Perla.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>
<seg id="211">Archive of archive.</seg>
<seg id="212">This is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor who is accused of kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos's son, a man who, over the years, recognized the extent of atrocities he had witnessed as a boy and who declared a Federal Supreme Court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows what great power has a parent about his child and how this child chose for himself a path of redemption.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall. there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">Everyone named him "Kent."</seg>

<seg id="238">I went in and saw a couch that people were tortured.</seg>

<seg id="350">Adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Levine, which was widely shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The fault happened to the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The daily Kyoto Shimbun newspaper, published in Kyoto, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "" "" "how could it come to such an English translation?" ""</seg>

<seg id="361">The word "terrible" was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of elderly motorists who are involved nationwide in accidents is a reason to concern.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture, in 2005, 1,941 were caused by a total of 19.460 accidents of seniors. this corresponds to a share of 10%.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">For translating, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the starting text and active language skills to transfer it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr-user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their native language, who could make translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost reasons or relatively small number of native speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that do not have foreign employees do not allow translations to be produced in-house. then, the Japanese staff, whose English skills are considered the best, are made to translators - no matter how good or bad their language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr-user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The confused and mysterious phrases that arise by machine translations show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time. this applies to some languages very special.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, among them also the puzzling prints, which often decorate t-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr-user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable as an ornament or at least harmless. however, from large companies or government that have the means to guarantee higher standards, you can expect more thorough translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source of translation.</seg>
<seg id="390">Venezuela: to participate in protests and security measures on the internet and on TV</seg>
<seg id="391">Main page of the "Navegar con Libertad" portal (Free Surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, 7 April, Venezuelan Internet users registered that they had no access to the Vivoplay online channel.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the internet sites of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online broadcasters also took photographs of the protests in Caracas, organized by opposition groups, resisting the government of Nicolás Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began in early April after the Supreme Court disbanded the Parliament and handed over the parliamentary tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a Traceroute. he pointed out that the connection was capped, and recommended the users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Zensur: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that web pages Venezuelan providers are again locked.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the site of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular among the Venetians with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been reluctant to report protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission for Telecommunication threatened them with fines and lockings, if they continued to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission watched this as a "call to violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels, I registered at @ vivoplaynet again.</seg>
<seg id="403">Astonishing that this is still cheaper than buying two liters of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO, VEGA, later confirmed that not only Vivoplay is inaccessible by blocking the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online channels. this also applies to the website where the National Assembly carries out its meetings.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research conducted by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that the local internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique by which the DNS servers respond badly requests of certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server responds faulty or refuses the request when calling this website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third locked channel, the transmission was set on Thursday, April 6, when the VPITV cameraman Elvis Flores, who transferred the protests in Caracas live, was detained.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went back to broadcast.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it has also been reported that the government regulates Internet connections, making it more difficult for the Venezuelans to access multimedia reports on current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "she said." "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old she began to work as Criadita for the family. as Criaditas, one calls for more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a big family with little money surpasses her minor son or her underage daughter to another family. in exchange, the child receives food, training and a roof above the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">What is not mentioned, however, is that the children will have to pay homework for it, which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice, called Criadazgo, is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organizations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After completing her studies Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She talked with Criaditas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collecting testimonies, researching and prancing.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call things by name, because the feeling of gratitude which is vaccinated for the Criaditas is generally guaranteed to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="429">"" "" "" "the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," "" "explains Alvarenga." ""</seg>
<seg id="430">There is, on the one hand, the family who have their daughter in the belief that they can develop their education, improve their position in society and "make something out of themselves" to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family, who takes the girl with herself and justifies its exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and perhaps even starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of the Criadazgo</seg>

<seg id="435">In January 2016 there was a relatively unknown phenomenon, which takes place in secrecy in paraguan households, but a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín had come to the hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed traces of heavy blows. shortly after she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military company Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who worked as an official at the Einwohnermeldeamt.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived with them in their home in Vaquería, a small town with just 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016, Ferreira climbed up to Marín with a stick until it suffered fatal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later the media reported about the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the deep in the Paraguayan society responsible for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">"" "several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that" "" "no other Carolina" "" "in Paraguay would be allowed." ""</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photos were widespread in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay, more cows are registered as children," says Tina Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers, it is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents, it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbors of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a rapid examination of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to murder the girl who was their Criadita, sentenced to 30 years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="453">When the case comes to court, the case of Carolina Marín may be a trend-setting - for the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of Criadazgo to court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Criaditas are not only exploited as labour forces, they also live isolated from other girls in their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farpe where her father worked, had to register bankruptcy and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers had to go all work and started selling candy on the street or on the market to earn money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita to the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of their employers, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day.</seg>

<seg id="526">A subtype of the larger family of leopards that strike through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian Leopards (Panthera pardus saicolor). altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">As Raza shows in the video, "The Persian Leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem," and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large predator.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian Leopard in the free wilderness is low and goes against zero. when the team in the video proves that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks in pure joy.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from the Shizugawa High School on Shifting awa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>

<seg id="544">At the beginning of March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo daily, responsible for North-East Japan, was the progress achieved over the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple-catastrophe" from March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima triggered the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi prefecture. Miyagi prefecture was a great prefecture in Japan's northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring prefectures Fukushima and Iwate have been forcibly evacuated, as the tsunami had left whole coastal cities disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">The prefecture Fukushima still experienced a nuclear accident, already alone, therefore, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows from the local point of view that progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The report also contains descriptions of the leading players including key financial metrics and analysis of competitive pressures within the market.</seg>
<seg id="550">The apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that by December 2015, 77 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was able to record the biggest success among the three prefectures, 80 per cent of the planned replacement buildings were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 per cent of such buildings, whereas Fukushima forms the final light with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">At the same time, one still tries to surround the final replacement houses six years after the catastrophe, evacuated by accommodation shelters (precaution custody, kasetsu juutaku).</seg>
<seg id="555">After the three-fold catastrophe nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such homes.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuated from Fukushima in 2011 are still living in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful on this occasion. more than 75 percent of the evacuees, which were haughed after the disaster in Behelsen shelters, were resettled into final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the figure is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The stand of works and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper could determine, 1074 of 1100 schools affected by misfortune, opened its doors until December 2016, which almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 percent of fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of fishing ports have resumed their operation in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident occurred in the three prefectures of agricultural land large-scale.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident, as only 690 acres of 5 400 hectares of farmland from Fukushima are located in the nuclear blackzone.</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but also here Fukushima stays far away.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 percent on the same level as before the misfortune. Fukushima, on the other hand, can have only 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal dwellers, it is more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the indigenous population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to find out an overall picture, the paper led numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuees. she asked them about the state of rebuilding and how their empathy has changed over the tsunami-risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about tsunami awareness among the indigenous population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who had to evacuate Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In her issue of the anniversary of the earthquake, Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung also focused her attention on the situation of the evacuated Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to witness not only the powerful earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima's prefecture was also witness to the worst, disaster-causing nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed.</seg>
<seg id="578">From 160 000 evacuated from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were displaced in areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 there were more than 230,000 people, back to Fukushima, converted into permanent replacement dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the 2017 stand, 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima live outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas, most of the evacuees who are still in Behelfsbasishausen are older than 50 years old. they are well known because the efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive building projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games which will take place in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was included in the intensive care unit this week: last Friday a police officer had struck him during a demonstration in Goiânia with a headstock. nationwide millions of demonstrators took part in a protest march against austerity.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studies social sciences at the University of Goiás, has suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated him on this Saturday and now transferred him into an artificial coma.</seg>

<seg id="599">The local photo journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus who spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">In the pictures, the face of the police officer could also recognize who attacked with a stick. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the Military Police was announced in the Brazilian federal state of Goiás that Sampaio had been suspended until the end of the investigation of the incident from the active ministry.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officers, as he embarked on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira in Goiânia (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer would be beaten by a demonstrator and land on the intensive ward, his face would be on TV for six months and the entire suppression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desnovalizador," a press channel of media activists from Goiânia, shared the video taken by Luiz da Luz on the net in which you see how Mateus is attacked by the police officer and several medics will hasten to it shortly afterwards.</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Álvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in all of Cuba opened its doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The community Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the Western Cuban province of Mayabeza, is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - regardless of the fact that there is no known sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It was two years ago when the activities were paralysed in the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the rise, the sugar cane industry was standing still in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until the scaffolding was left out of steel and concrete.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some rarely change the job.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commute daily to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a veteran veteran, who rises every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not screwed its sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which are in operation after a long inactive time, because they were received.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene recalls to have heard exactly that in Mañalich I would get the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry already resists plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, poor administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the amount produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for concern for the country some decades ago, but the bad harvests are no longer a new thing.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old path of the church already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated, and hardly competitive they became unsustainable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left factories that can produce sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price increased about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugars must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report published by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organisation.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate circa €85 million for the country.</seg>

<seg id="654">In the following years, the shutdown of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people, received their full salaries for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">"" "if Nene, how he is known as a soldier, speaks about the closing of the factory, is the word he repeats most," "" "scam" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all questioned are of the same opinion: not one of them informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first year of closing, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially recorded documents, which would only be distinguished from the parts that would be removed, addressing the addressee and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the Minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on the responsibility was taken over and the letters were getting more and more frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the quiet factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane factories in operation," he affirmed.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years, is waiting for retirement in another facility, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved against his will at the shutdown of the factory, in whose construction he helped.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part he removed, he disassembled one of his 31 years of work.</seg>

<seg id="692">Teenagers of the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them. they do this by means of hip-hop, thanks to a series of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach young groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were conducted by the educator David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked together in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then collaborated with the Cree Hip-Hop group The NorthStar.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop is thus increasing that the young participants in discussions arise like "cultural identity, language, conflict, love, self-acceptance," or whatever comes into mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the US state Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called Highway of Tears, a street stage in western Canada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs is despite the influence of globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youngsters don't always dominate the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song, that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the refrain is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstar Hip-Hop Group, who gave them a verse in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the verse is available in transcription, as well a translation into English, which is translated here into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on my days on earth</seg>
<seg id="707">That is the day you will take our scream</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we lost our way in life as a youth</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how to live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and go ahead of our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">This is how they can do what they intended for the creator.</seg>
<seg id="713">In the commentary part, the reader and proponent of the Cree language Kevin Brousseau also makes a contribution and adds the verse in syllabes (which is also published on his blog and published here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, near the entrance shokuhin sanpuru ("Plastische Modelle der Küche") is displayed by any dish that is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is an entire industry dedicated to the production of these plastic courts.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tokyo district of Kappabashi there is a variety of these small companies that produce just those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga over 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so usually that they do not even notice them any more. however, a new trend is today transformed into showy mobile phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">Naver Matoma published the blogger itinii series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new with plastic courts decorated cell-ribbons as they are shown at Kichijoji Tokyu's department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been turned to kitschy collectibles, as in this case, refrigerator magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are some shokuhin crankets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in the essentials is becoming increasingly more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, a kaisen-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) turned into a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We have also made this part for the exhibition in Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile stand and mobile designers allow you to make your own work of art. in this case IKURA or salmon roe is used, a popular topping served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there anyone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I'll probably be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic courses can also take a less appetizing form to surprise colleagues or family members uncomfortable.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile stand has the shape of melted ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice-balls (Onigiri), earrings and handybands made of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can view more bizarre plastic courts at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag #</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports in domestic and foreign media about the infamous "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the missiles and drinks regularly appear in statistics. however, they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy which this struggle brings.</seg>
<seg id="750">The report on drugs bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the leader of the Sinaloa cartel, urged the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent incident, no one looks at the bereaved or the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind every body, behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret trenches, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">For this reason, the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project "aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "with drug trafficking") that will give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were caught up in the fight between the law enforcement authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project as follows:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime can not only be feared by our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The impact is much more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when businesses close, because they are threatened by drug dealers and therefore have to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video called "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" (English: "how fear lives") tells the story.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father looking for secret tombs after his son every weekend.</seg>

<seg id="773">The editors of "aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and state leadership.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been familiar with disease and sensationjournalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">Every day I come to newspaper kiosks and see the cover pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from acts of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the frame.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent to this or consider it as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants Narco (German: drug dealers) when it's big. and it's also not normal that people listen to songs about the "heroism" of the offenders when they walk through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "" "" "the hopelessness of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified by the fact that they were" "" "settled" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to talk that they remain spared by such tragedies when they are not stirring and quiet.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the post "Four months of blackmail in the capital district: how a family has been looted by threats." it describes how armed criminals presses money from their business for month, until they end not only destroyed the business, but also torn their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how many people can change your entire life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain of this never passes, the trauma stays, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>

<seg id="794">We only contact you if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The more we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She included her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when to kidnap or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days if cry would dissolve my deep rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article" "" "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: a Generation of Violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care about them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a orphan and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, make potatoes, tortillas warm and make "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for whom life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years before, when he was only a few blocks away from his home, who saw the bloody misery of his father, who was shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence caused by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the citizen's council for public security and government of the Government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">Only in 2010 the public prosecutor called 3103 Morde. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 Mordes per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of tales that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate them into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal Político 2015 initiated the data journalism project Narcodata, whose aim is to present the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking, which has tortured the country over the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images to messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010 a tank truck crossed the town of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tipping around and exploded. 230 people died.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second largest country had been neglected for years and devastated. the streets in the region have become dangerous trails full of potholes which were difficult to drive.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tank truck fell victim to it.</seg>
<seg id="828">The representative describes a fireball that wrapped dozens of houses including a cinemas nearby, which was full of people who were watching the soccer world championship.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses burned and charred corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>

<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015 fighters of Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian towns of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastic atrocities in which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the numbers could not be confirmed." "" "no one stayed behind to count corpses," "" "said a people to Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many had been shattered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images the follow-up time could be presented figuratively.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack remained unresolved, but the military point in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt by Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerged from the DR Congo, as it was mistakenly presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the DR Congo is only one in a number of misconceptions; Africa check has documented orders to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the image was presented as evidence of mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further forward personal comments such as this example mistakenly uses the DR Congo with sources of the mass media in order to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image of Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a lightning sign, released by the United Nations describes those who were able to flee blows, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>

<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news site, which reportedly claimed, the president of Myanmar's Thein, said, monks and politicians had participated in the assassination of the Rohingya Muslims. in addition, they had used the image from DR Congo to view this information.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong issues or frames (framing) that go through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about silence in connection with the assassinations of Christians by Muslims or - to defend Muslims - the assassinations of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how African life is undervalued compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is important both. therefore it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is what happens if readers can no longer believe these pictures.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media there are dozens of people who unintentionally share the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggests this mood of false and false information that actual atrocities are untrue and the actual horror of what actually happened in DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been debated in detail (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that refusing images of a refusal to recognise the tragedy. sometimes these pictures are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images desensitize readers and viewers and take them the ability to find empathy (such as this study, investigating how violent media seem to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss regarding forcible portrayals in the news media, the fact is that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News." they will have to think about the situation in which a picture suggests something which can actually be used in the context or completely misused manner.</seg>
<seg id="940">Any investigation of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name Untranslatable (e.g. insurmountable) endeavors to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words are in each language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these unsettable words are already well known today (like the famous Portuguese acidade) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sockesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubbornly any attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression does not suffice, which is why a full explanation and sometimes a little context is needed to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected in an online list for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find words from the Mwotap language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"" "" "" "vakasteglok" "" "- get tired of your parents in recognition of how you have strived for you in your younger years." ""</seg>
<seg id="953">And words found in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"" "" "" "kwadi" "" "- The comfort or laziness you feel after being warmed in the sun on cold days." ""</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds own words from his blog about:</seg>

<seg id="1131">Why do I tell this here at this TEDx Talk 2017 in Stanford, where Edward Said, the man who showed us how wars are led and people are being researched through the creation of the "other" in the public imagination, four decades ago even the Science of Stanford was.</seg>
<seg id="1132">We have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions after the role of being consciously and unconsciously to solidify the "other"; just as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women's March, because the occupation that we have no president, who bombed the chocolate cake, while he already bombed countries and "other people," goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1134">Initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity</seg>
<seg id="1135">Story telling, by Flickr users Daniele Rossi, using license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) initiative, the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the insurmountable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States where TLS has conducted events since 2015, the risk is that small and not quite as small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces where residents don't have to forget who they are to belong to.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening often to understanding" "" "these events are instead" "" "listening" "", "to appreciate, to feel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format storytellers start their story in their own language first and translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional story teller, their devotion and their representation lead to the fact that the audience can be informed.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story in Burkina Faso, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, the story narrator Rassidatou konate takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for their country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamusara tells the beak of the rabbit and the baboon in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"" "after explaining the meaning of his fork, John Nyamusara is asked:" "" "how to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" "" "with a wide grin he shares his sense of inclusiveness:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened to!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to extend this. everyone who is inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own history of history.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a re-examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amount to 72 million US dollars, on 3 April 2017, various religious and civil organizations participated in a mass demonstration; the march started at the puerta Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went up to Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juan.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and members continue to campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he has made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: publica, the annual conference on digital culture, which is hosted in Berlin, an event dedicated to the # FreeBel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, managing director of Book Sprints, publishes books within three to five days, read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The cost of freedom: collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book published last year contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of suppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built and what the real cost associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked on side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeed and to create some sense from our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated internet volunteer who has been detained in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was cancelled from the directory of the Adra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about his current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Collective Remembrance gives his friends and family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, right away.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has let many of us start thinking about their own destinies, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of time-wise extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activist has been in the custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military facility to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "Military Police of Bassel had taken on the basis of a" strictly secret "command of the Military Court from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 who presented themselves as insider of the Assad administration and made them aware of an alleged death sentence against their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">However, his whereabouts and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of creative commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassels had anticipated cultural prototypes as the work he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations, and here Greek-Roman architectural styles merge with local traditions and Persian influence.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time, Bassel could not know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would do everything to wipe out this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This stripe in digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel has not yet been able to complete this project.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my whole life with dreaming of freedom and bassel taught me to embrace it.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English even when he was in detention.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked. he taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened my door to technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how they use computers, at least theoretically without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the Author of Waiting (Waiting), a Promisuch that she wrote to her husband during the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together on the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English.</seg>

<seg id="1255">Mozambique responded with anger to a corruption case where a member of the government returned to work in the state apparatus after half of his prison sentence on which the corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defendants.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, whose advice was Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for his repressions to the company, which happened on 19 April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with an opinion of the General Public Prosecutor of the Republic, which submitted the application, there would be no obstacle to Cambaza to re-apply his old post, since the company did not fulfil discipline procedures after his imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not have the action good.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), a local institution which advocates public transparency in an interview with Deutsche Welle, condemned the company's decision to re-establish the director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "it is a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a step forward with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">"" "" "" "what we are aware of is that the company should lead a disciplinary approach to the contrary." ""</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company seemed to have no reasonable legal steps to apply the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"" "Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the ambique social media, also declines this behaviour and considers the case as" "" "wardly" "" ":" ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent guy, he would be counselor after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and has left half of them.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold paid lectures and motivating speeches he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent he consented to become reintegrated into the company, which he helped to inflict damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Consequently, it is obvious: Cambaza is liked to be paid for its silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Resistible!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says, the director does not have morale:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he enacted him I cannot believe that one rewarded someone in such a way that has already been massively offended the state.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is lacking the morality to return and serve the state * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but it was only served by the state itself.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself became tired of this man who was unloaded and finally sentenced to a long sentence.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to information from Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts out of the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective 'Indian'.</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook censored the word "Kalar," as part of an initiative in order to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalistic movements has given the word an extremely decreasing connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of useful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'kalar 'may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically invoke hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubt for its use.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several burmesan words with different meanings, which have the same character sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, stool is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (splitting bse), 'Kalar oat' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooker Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a witty fashion if they knew how he could alleviate his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The sentence ku la - "Healing" (ku) + the Fragewort (la) in Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet is the opinion that it will reduce hate speech by radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook needs to be more analytical before putting all posts that stand in suspicion to spread racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "Facebook deletes the word" "" "Kalar" "" "not manually." ""</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">"" "" "" "automatism will not understand what you write on Facebook." ""</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to analyze the post carefully and check it by checking out the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">"" "for example," "" "Kalar Htine" "" "(chair) and" "" "Kalar pae" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good is that these dirty nationalists, who spread hate speech, receive fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to all who disseminate hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experience of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat has proven that the censorship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or alternative way of writing of the censored word in order to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to clear his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I got attention to this new policy of Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was chatting about the liken, post and sharing of content for 24 hours, because the post "failed to follow" the Facebook community standards. "</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author wrote his opinion on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet Community asking for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censing such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "in addition, it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "Erbsencurry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsified posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million usefulness that would give them a big turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook automatic censorship has caused much ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun on Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts which have no hate speech but still have been removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>

<seg id="1336">In the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence.</seg>

<seg id="1338">"" "" "" "Facebook was criticized for his failure to bring out the proliferation of hate speech on his burmese sides." ""</seg>

<seg id="1357">Having previously agreed in the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The English-speaking Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the United States, internationally darkened.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month Turkey has now blocked the popular and on the crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day by day, it becomes clear how important the platform for users is to find and share reliable information and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV-series defend themselves against the blockage.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many technology-sealed Internet users are used to use retooling tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third biggest VPN prevalence of the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia since 2008, as recently published in an published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet have been held since 2007, after the Internet law (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the world's most famous country, when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform continues to be locked, several mirrorpages (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated) are dipped.</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform put all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. computer calculator connections), which does not support the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is available in spite of the legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we have heard the news (about the blockage of Wikipedia), we put all of it in writing snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, it is possible to read the content in a decentralized and distributed way.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users view at least all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to bypass the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has produced both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a MirrorPage from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar Mirrorpages, when the respective country Wikipedia is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member and staff at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access another URL that is not the original. that which you see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server sends the request to the correct Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia even if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">This is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with badly placed motifs and washed colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera with him and try to get the situation graced.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar strives to bring Nepal to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown directly next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first class situation helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested from home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rapti River would be a leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran out with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father was watching him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was located and I immediately started to kindle pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aims to collaborate with the authorities to gain global recognition for Nepal's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not so frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, for he faced face to face to face to face,</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can not disturb the opinion of the sheep in sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the bucket appeared. he immediately goes, we see ourselves and he stares me through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar places the logo "I click for beauty" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepalese nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to take photographs of Ottern in the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he was able to photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodations.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This post was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on video Volunteers, an award-winning international media organisation from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was published as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women avoid having the greatest care to pronounce the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronouns or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh women admit that they respect the husband because of social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences they should consider the norm to keep this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto from the Indian state Odisha was convicted by a headcourt and expelled from her family and the village community after having addressed a married relatives with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of naming their wives is also common among men. however, they have far less advices to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Pune in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel and housewives, joined a unique club and quickly became the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place for them only in which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the # Khelbadal campaign, which is operated by the community of Video Volunteers and set up for the dismantling of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawar has been working with the help of her video camera for seven years at the discovery of practices such as children's marriage and the exile of HIV- and AIDS infected, and leads this club.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports how this club created a safe place for these women and at the same time they made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her discussion lap was women who do not call their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this subject, because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Unpronouncing the name of their husbands is a custom that they are duly debated and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not respect this is regarded as deceitful, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband in the name of her husband, wanted to try at home as it is running.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion lap her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent until the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Uhhm.. Howdy there, simply changed into alert to your blog through Google, and found that it is truly informative. thank you and best of luck. Svar</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage, Rohini started their first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to take the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with various feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then she asked all," "" "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, does that mean they don't respect us?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"" "" "" "some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands over their lips," "" "says Rohini Paz from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on breaking a centuries-old tradition, in which married women must never pronounce the name of their husbands." ""</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she chicked only in front of her during the whole exercise; another decided to release the whole frustration against him and his family by cursing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in adrenalin rush about having broken with an old custom, the women decided that they would actually try at home to call their husbands in their name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini received a multitude of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put on women's head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member chose to do it at dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law she stared her, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini thought I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation carried out in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the cinded red dot on the forehead, indicating the status of the spouses:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only need to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"" "" "" "I said to my husband that I would wear the" "" "zinnoberred point" "" "if he also did." ""</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not fully listened to them, but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves, not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make a trip at each discussion club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to worry about who could hear," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their life; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, such as our identities attached to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say certain things, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a panel discussion we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected to the clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have been wearing saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most, this is okay, but some wanted a saline curta, a wide shirt above a pants, they did not dared.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much controversy and discussion about the advantages of their own choice of clothes, morals associated with the saris and much more, Rohini donated their own couple of Kurtas (Oberhemden) into a discussion round so that the women could carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will manage it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">To the question whether in the five months since their first discussion club has changed something, Rohini confirmed that things are slowly getting into the roles:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have done only small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women rehearsed it a few times, but then stopped telling the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, make it yet, but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now carry Zinnoberrot on their forehead at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like violinists for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothing - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How to explain Rohini:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1552">For just under five days the Beatles were in the country, but this was enough to allow the Japanese to go through.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The people here quite quickly became clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>

<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Milk, a few kilometers from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was found beheaded and part of the organs were taken.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently they confessed that the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi are used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There is the local superstition that the head of a cat-headed man could bring gold or bring wealth, the police spokesman of Zambézia of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on flat-headed men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of murder for obscure purposes, are people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the fact that the UN in 2016 introduced a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in neighbouring Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to combat this superstition and prejudice.</seg>

<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of sparse-headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morrumbala, province of Zambézia, has been commissioned by the traditional shamans, which also indicates that there existed a faith, according to which the victims in the head had power to generate the riches.</seg>

<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of Chinese dissident, Liu Xiaobo, attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized for liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to 11 years in prison for "Subversion" (State endangerment), having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto demanding the democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China described Lius case as" "" "an internal affair" "" "and said a spokesman, he considered it" "" "not necessary to discuss this with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">However, China continues to allow calls from the international community to release the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or permit him to treat him abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely wiped out to the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press summarized several reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">A spokesman, however, refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exert pressure to allow Liu abroad to be treated.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway, Norway, Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende refused to answer questions about Lius's release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came into a shock after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government told that this was nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations continued until December last year. in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon drivers to China as exports since 2010 were largely blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his award in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Because of his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union and the European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament passed a decision on which China was asked to release Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The EU's top-level diplomat, Federica Mogherini, also called for China to release Lius as she reported in an explanation on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr Lius wife as well as family members.</seg>

<seg id="1662">Previously diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Reuters that China had great concerns if the vortices around Liu could surpass the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">USA, Canada, Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum asked China to provide Liu an appropriate medical treatment and give him the opportunity to leave his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">FR's attorney told AFP earlier that Liu Xia could visit him every day, but the police always oversees the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to contact anyone outside, including his attorneys, to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada calls on China to maintain its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and to release the rights perpetrated for the exercise of these rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France and France</seg>
<seg id="1669">In a statement on 29 June, France's Foreign Office invited China to release Liu for humanitarian grounds:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo will receive all treatments he needs, regardless of where you need. furthermore, his wife and family can have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news station France Info had already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the State Department announced that there is no further information out whether France will eventually receive it.</seg>

<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislature Yu Mei-nu from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to permit the sick intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama - Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, expressed himself in a statement on June 28 at Liu and admitted that many asked him to pray for Lius well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he was severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, more stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moving and also encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens inspired by Liu Xiaobo who signed the Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>

<seg id="1681">Singapore. Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem silly, as Singapore is recognised at an international level as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State of New York, the minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports Singapore as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is where most people commit a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog of Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "turn up logic" "" "to defend the existing dictatorial exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, we can say that we are not a country in the end.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons imposed by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', given that he appeared invariably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally towns that are guided permanently by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once one reaches the core of the topic, the good old lyre emerges from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be Democrats, leave the twisted logic, since it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the final event, the answers given in the last week of Shanmugam were given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He camouflaged appropriate questions with non-answers rationally.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng challenges Shanmugam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to what country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our valued K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clarify this point as long as he was paid up to be part of the government of the City of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his comment on the blog, he points out the critics that one should start reading the entire transcript of the conference to better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to Singapore is a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcription.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore was rather a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "he explained why the elections in Singapore are so uneven important even when we enjoy free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compares Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">When he said, Singapore is not a country, "he obviously didn't mean it in this sense!</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who as leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expected - I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it is right and aware of what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review splits the weak points of Shanmugams Arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "Mr. Shanmugam" "" "trusted a mistake" "" "or was it a wrong speaker?" ""</seg>

<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, especially about the situation of the country under the Junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these recordings of the video, which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has been pursuing over the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">The "44 rules of the girls" possibly relate to the draconical section 44 of the provisional constitution, which gives the commander-in-chief of the army absolute decision-making on important national issues.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapahula, located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year-old Mexican guy, a small woman with a corals-pink spectacle frame and gold colored earrings in teddy bear shape.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and grew up in Tapahula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is owed to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a target for Africans and Haitians who are on the transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about $2.50 per night guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - but hundreds of African and Haitian migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, tells Ms Ramírez, the people come in full small buses and from the top of the coast they begin to cry: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has received 200 guests simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some even slept outside on cardboard boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse nobody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, they buy drugs that they cannot pay, they massage them with a balm the feet exhausted by the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived recently.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>

<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">You have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move northwards.</seg>
<seg id="1925">"" "the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." "" "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," "" "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that the Haitians and Africans often travel along the route and that Africans are already talking to Whatsapp from Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weakened, he has begun his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," "" "he responds smiling." "" "we will always stay in touch" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez tells her that her guests often send text messages when they have gone to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She does not know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but it is not the only spark hope for the migrants who travel through Tapahula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Valenzuela and his family have migrated this winter in their little house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and found that the bus tickets to many African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment 25 people are there, mostly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests do.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "I have lived in the United States," "" "he tells." "" "I have experienced what they experience." ""</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his jobsite.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travel through Tapahula comes from Central America, others also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me he has fled to Honduras with his wife and three children, who wanted to blackmail money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapahula he asked for accommodation and an unknown, a single person, offered him her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa, everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the courses, the traveller secluded their phones quietly.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she blends in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair care she has made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>

<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities region in the west of China, are compelled to install a spyware on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On 10 July, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan District of the city of Urumqi received a cell phone notification in which it notifies the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in communication, it is said that the app" "" "preventing access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the authorities knew the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture, because they had already installed the app to exchange messages with a private cloud group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the announcement of the police, the app would detect and prosecute the sources and the distribution channels of terrorists along with "illegal religious" activities and "damaging information" including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a security service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is blocking pornographic websites, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filtering for minors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hacker to manipulate the home network of a person or steal it from it.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While reports on digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those living in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit disturbances and dissatisfaction in the conflict regions, the authorities often arrange extreme tenants and surveillance measures, as well as routine internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">Based on Twitter-based media outlet "Images from mainland China," the censored news published in China showed photos of a checkpoint where police officers were randomly examining whether they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required the app to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are discovered at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be detained up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use devices intended for elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the rest technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China," also published a Jingwang product description from which the software can raise the requisite request of a Windows operating system and therefore receive unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang, computers and mobile phones are used in Xinjiang to electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The provisions in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Council Council to minimize the distribution of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and institutions connected with the party, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of cyber security office while operating their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report by Freedom House, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities published a regulation on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media storage cards" at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos." however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a number of other possible quotations, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he slips to his screen, sometimes to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his with nicotine stained lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the highest level of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family was forced to flee from their village in Palestine where they had lived as felahyea (about: farmers).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years Hdaib has been a passionate activist who opposed the conservative majority and questioned their old opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapeseed music.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with issues such as orialism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues are not only found in his hometown Amman Relevanz, but also in cities that range from Damascus to Syria to far as far as Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited by limits in his thinking and can sympathise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even though he does not openly admit it, he horts a special inclination against US foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones, has something to do with his identity as "Palestinian refugees of the second generation" - he calls himself even though he was born in Jordan, and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think about my own circumstances," "" "says Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think that because I am a man," "" "while in water he shook Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; at this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee in a sensational hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the quacks of lukewarm coffee and the threshing of the Kent cigarette in the nose speak primarily of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open air, especially when one throws a look into neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan - to drink water - not to land in jail.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Ministry of Interior of Jordan did a show of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentarians who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontship Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The deputies and former press spokespersons in the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which poses the proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes throughout the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights" who continue to use "for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement probably should not be simply silky rhetoric, but actually reflecting a clear and clear reality in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016 Hdaib brought traditional lineage to Leibe by depicting his vision of the fate of Arab women who have marital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a manifest unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those they should actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past few years, the number of 'volunteers' has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of volunteers in 2016 reached its peak; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan is missing the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence to support appropriate ways.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law of crime against crime in 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of inhouse-friendly violence can be detained at an indefinite time in prison, "and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expenditure as well as the guarantee on the part of the family that the woman will not do anything.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaib's music enjoys great popularity and is known not to shy away from issues that have long been taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is politically, admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression of opinion, cannot separate from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "" "" "I have become a policy of politics," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib attacks the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "ghareeb," the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political at the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song entitled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse repeats itself often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where you can get what you want "- be it faith or non-belief, heterogeneity or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay people and lesbians and that comments on LGBTQ + individuals have been heavily censored up until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014 Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya to remember that his comments were torn from the context, twisted and his opinion had been censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but was only a edited version," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib is openly campaigning for the Arabic LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals does not correspond to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuis, a poet of the eighth century, who has remained in memory today thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks itself: if Abu Nuis, who should later work on behalf of the caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians do that?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the Issachar kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian news service formally adopted several former government members and members of the Teacher's Association, with the reason that they have voiced critically to the problems related to the corruption that deeply rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, the Hdaib concert is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - so it sees Hdaib - consists of slow, thoughtful and inner changes. it is certain that these changes take place every day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the end, Hdaib dreams, like millions of other Arabs, from a Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of experiencing "it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will be approached by music, art and literature on a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, streaming and artificially managed democracies. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until this time, Hdaib will continue to coat further and therefore also resist.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which Aman is a student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warrior puppets are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebula festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One assumes that there is a variant of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually celebrated in many parts of Tohocus in August. another theory states that the wagons, the drums and dancing over more than a thousand years have been handed over and come from a time in the armies from the west of Japan to the northeast marched to force the Indigenous inhabitants of the region, the emishi to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can hardly imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition at Wa no Akari (literally.</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking at the Meguro Gajoen for a long time now: two wagons are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and yet another stunning way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summerfestival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # Nebuchafestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The view of an 18-metre-high fixed car was incredible.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Let's enjoy the rest of the summer!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely, outer appearance and body care were as important as in this story, because they help to keep the Peruvian youth out of the criminality and promote a legitimate occupation like that of the hairdresser.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate, where street smoking and illegal drug trade are commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="2169">Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru experiences - like many other medium- and South American countries - a rising demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, appearance and therefore also the fancy styling of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) has led to the fact that more and more normal citizens embark on the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Experts meet each other to show who of them can create the most eccentric look, as can be seen in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and get an apprenticeship in the hairdressing art instead of bad advice, which allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a profession that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Prior to the school year beginning in March, the school offered special training workshops and talked about some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud, because we have built up this educational association for love with the children.</seg>

<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the" "" "Love messages to Guerillakämpfer" "", "which the international online magazine Tea After Twelve published." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write a letter to love for people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not much more important to accommodate people who feel expelled?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Precisely this question left the young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga from the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Cartas por la Reconciliación (letters for reconciliation), which encouraged young people to write guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla deflection FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), which forms the key point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">Internationally the signatory of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">In front of the Colombians, however, there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters, who have lived in illegal camps for many years, were exposed to war rhetoric and have been carrying out their weapons around the clock, must now be integrated into the lives of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, in turn, has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guerilla fighters, must now take them into their ranks and support them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombian joined together and had to help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter - to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as Inspiration for the Campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to reconciliation arose on the world summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly to Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">He explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share his love with people this year who needed the most urgent response.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now find their place in society and build up a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far, more than 2000 letters have been collected within the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the City Government of Cali and Leonardo from BogotArt Foundation traveled to the camp to personally transfer the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The FARC members set themselves as they had done before to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it's unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies in between," the policy-student Manuela Jiménez Avila told later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, an employee of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former fighter led me through the guerrilla fighters camp.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go in, because beside him on the bed a MGL Garnet was lying, a deadly weapon in Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I spoke to him anyway and asked," "" "Hello, what do they just do?" "" "he answered:" "" "I answer for a letter that someone wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "never in my life somebody has written something so beautiful, so I answer them." "" "I suddenly ran the tears over the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I embraced him completely and sat down beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired of war, was tired of being the faithful companions of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected something else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers from the Hungertod. "I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside, waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices and voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the beginning students and some leaders of the FARC gathered for a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as early as war and the FARC already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why the FARC leaders explained the history of the organization, their ideals and gave an insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the state worked on the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can help shape society in this country more just.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "the goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Hearing these people who had never heard hearing and had no suffrage, and to realize that people, whom I often saw as a monster and even hate, were also only people with beautiful feelings, who were turned around by their living conditions and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives is hurting me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - even those killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have answered the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the city of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian was prophesied that peace would rule after disarming.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as it gives inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people willing to resort to arms, to stand up and protest for their rights. and that is also completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC now focus on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology belong to it - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, do our contribution and bring sacrifice, because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2262">When I was in the process of highlighting a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a bug voice saying: "here's a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but nothing hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "then I heard a sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" "" "how long will you honor the family, you scandfleck?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I just know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and awakened the last end in the hospital again.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently, some women had got everything and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had launched an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two keyrings in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which nursing staff were you laid - in which the men or women of the women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and laid me up to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time on his office, I got to do it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for having handled with me respectfully.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They asked me to return to Chechnya to prove that all was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They asked absurd demands: some told me that I had to prove it by going through the streets without going through the streets; others wanted me to appear in the official TV in Grosny and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was bad speech and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I have said on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how has your family tried to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once talked to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "You have brought a monster to the world that has not only humiliated your family, but the entire Republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">We cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she put a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbours came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window stood a car with a darkened window panes and a number plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was a bit lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to award their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help I left the country, but then something unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought them without registering me, without a passport, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"" "when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message:" "" "you don't believe, you would be safe, just because you left the country?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know in which hotel you are stuck. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "just to prove it to you: it is the number 115." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we don't talk about gender inequality, this is a taboo subject.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditionally Caucasian elements I still carry in myself.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I cannot overcome this mental barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I really care how the person looks at which she recalls from her past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends, those who have stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For me, I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who sat in a gun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told us that during Ramadan, no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">In this way, I mean, they probably load the relatives, they take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end demand a proof that the so-called "honor" has been experienced by blood's satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there wouldn't be so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, especially those who have no wealthy relatives or who were drowned by their relatives in order to face Kadyrows's judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that one can later present them as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say:" "" "should they be killed, they will show their bodies on TV and pretend that they would have attacked some village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply gone but specifically dipped in order to radicalise themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is that only a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was detained in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people in this prison have disappeared after their beard has grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took it along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, that person was when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Up to now, however, they were not presented as bandits, there were no reports about it yet. however, we suspect that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why otherwise would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know whether these persecutions and abductions of people, who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation, have already occurred in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always carried my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known in Grosny, when I still lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the grave!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was considered, I had never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "originally Russia wanted to introduce us to" "" "civilisation" "", "but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were hatched; I had colored eyelashes, bore tube jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security ministry of Sharia has never crossed my hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian Theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches stood, and the whole town knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language, there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Spent not about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">You often say it to children if they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they simply closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never offended me, never hunted and never smitten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrov stepped on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began speaking on TV about morals.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not talk about us per se, but primarily about the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless, one could feel how people began to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had laughed and laughed before, watched you at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel how the situation in the republic was steadily worse.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what kind of activity do you do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize Teacreff, summaries, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have no penny for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I have discovered these people myself when I clapped refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that is silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">This is the nature, which has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chetschenen, who want to prophesy with foam in front of the mouth that there are no bobbins with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans have who, the Cabardins have who, the Russians have also what; on the whole planet they have - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it is uncomfortable to hear anything.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know many think on men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different kinds of sensation to be exact, different life settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry that I will be so personally here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on 27 August reversed the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is marked by poverty and unemployment, into the limelight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he ashamed for his own helplessness to be able to pay the inability for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and want to remain anonymous.</seg>

<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the town of Ahmet.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a little while later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide which happened in August within the Arabic ancestral minority, and activists warn on the spot that more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights stated that this month some other - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - hanged.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family-fathers who felt helpless and incapable of nourishing their families and to pursue a safe work because of the persecution of the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, in which a large majority of the Arab Ahwazi living in Iran, has been shaken by a profound economic crisis, which makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to contest their living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arabic ancestor was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy took power and in 1925 great efforts took to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran, as well as some of the richest and most valuable commercial areas for the Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the native population receives little from this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated disease, hunger and privation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime systematically denies Ahmad Arabs jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a variety of demons, which redirect water from the Arab territories into the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to worsen the devastation caused by dryness, and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industries.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi youth increased to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general director for cooperatives, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of the Ahwazis who are looking for a job, completed primary school, completed 55% a secondary school and have completed 45% a university degree.</seg>

<seg id="2423">For this reason, a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the creation process is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the creation process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">As functionaries and institutions do not prefer Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to job opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and force them to earn their living outside their homeland of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their name and surname to hide their belonging to the Ahwazi, as even Arab names are not tolerated at the workplace, let alone the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In view of the given circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi must endure, human rights activists propose alarm before the situation is explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world will wake up and take note of it.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the Afroféminas website.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women react - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be feminist and why we should generally be feminist.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, nowadays women still earn less money despite the same education as men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later come across a glass ceiling in various areas of life, and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer twice and triple below.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: when I come to talk on skin colour, on black women's black women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention the kind we have been abused physically, mentally and verbally, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists decided to keep silent about feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2448">However, all agree that women - all women - should come together to lift up their voices and 'Kumbaya, my Lord' to sing 'to achieve equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexualized violence there is an institutionalised form of racist motivating violence that we are exposed to black women in twofold ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnic and country of origin are less worthy than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background more often referred to the school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership, as white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights; on the other hand, I can't join a movement as black woman, in whose centre the white woman stands, who refuses to take into account injustices in her mind, which refer both to the sex and the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a feminist-feminist sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sojourner complained in her speech in 1851: "am I not a woman?" and I too refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a fearful and marginalised being in the historic sense.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groupings, which also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropriation to advance its egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlapping skin color and gender. for some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to teach them for a better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and to exclude themselves from white feminism, there is still the word "feminism" in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to release myself fully and entirely from feminism and call me to the movement of the Womanismus, which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of advocating me for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women to us according to our own ideas and go into the spheres created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book of Africana woman- (about: Africa-Womanismus: how we can defend ourselves) tells us that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped, which constitute the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can uplift black women and women of other cultures because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment in which my life has not passed, nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2471">"I wanted to do something for the river that we lost when I was still a kid," Musa tells.</seg>
<seg id="2472">Scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, the construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development, will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="2473">Musa is a member of the non-governmental organization of Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance, which is committed to protecting the rivers, streams, and waterways in Iraq, as well as to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources.

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and edited version of the article "The Wave of Violence Against Women in Paraguay" by Kurstructural. the article is part of the series # PorserMujer (# weighteinefraubin) reported on the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissioner said Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her expartner, who had become violent towards violence.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship, some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put into action, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman showed Balbuena because of mistreatment, the display of Ada Báez did nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman pulled her ad back.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">When women refrain at all, they generally receive no support from the State.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence can be reported to the law enforcement authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Content 1 Strike and Statistical 2 Invisible mistreatment and a judicial system, which is nothing subnimb3 Correspondence laws: good approach, lack of implementation punches and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is difficult to see how many women are really abused, says Mycensus González, researcher for gender questions at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a social science research institution in Paraguay. "there are several statements and reports, which do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the figures available are alarming.</seg>

<seg id="2506">In the beginning she didn't want it, but then still gave up.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos. but for two years she inherited the psychic power - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it, I always thought that only women have happened that are too subservient because they let themselves be deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the mistreatment of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically, if he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana, why she had fallen out of Carlos for so long and didn't leave him before.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that the victims of abuse would at least have a certain complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who is not from Paraguay, fought for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner interfered with her.</seg>

<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial resources for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, abuse is seen as part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here, a rethinking must take place, so that violence is no longer regarded as normal.</seg>

<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was adopted in the paraguan senate. prior to that, parts of the law were changed. among other things, a passage was cancelled, which the partners in cases of domestic violence called for reconciliation.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, Figure takes place with his consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely or even mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">For the need for medical research carried out on site, there are two reasons: on the one hand, many medicines and vaccines are missing in the offer of the global health care system, which cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have a far more serious impact in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and missing investment for researching these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research, which is carried out by African scientists, helps build up its own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of Center for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, when the AIDS epidemic showed first serious impacts on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a post-doc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched on the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the samic health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier talks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the samba national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I just started a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GM: what do you think about the most important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no basic research here. we only employ solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">That has to change, otherwise we will always stay receivers instead of being makers.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>

<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult it is to find suitable scientists for projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or to come here, because the financing and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GM: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work you didn't have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure doesn't meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GM: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on, and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special scientific training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, research of space, health care (non-transferable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GM: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa against Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often, it is the limited speed to do things, and the terrific access to scientific expertise that pose challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">"" "the system that magazines can only make articles accessible for payment (the so-called Paywall" "" ") also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research." ""</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "Open Source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This contribution by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine reported on solutions for environmental problems around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been bred in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 sorts, such as Outlaw, the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA-Astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Almost 20 years Morton's work was limited only by his own resourcefulness and the question of how many species he can get, limits set.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them further.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents protect not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or curved leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereals or cartels. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts in food safety are concerned about the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia of old tradition, Morton always breeds lettuce, but it takes longer, because his work is more and more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is as if in a river a boulder is lying to which I have to dull." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do that now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think that these patents go too far on salads." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before judgment, no one can breed a new type of salads, because all features are already patented. "it makes it as good as possible and tries to breed the features he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very careful and strives to use no material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">"" "he also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the US and around the world: open source Breeding (" "" "Open Source" "" "breedings)." ""</seg>

<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like that the movement from the IT sector originates rather than from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "open source" seed) can be inspired by the movement for free "open source" software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It has been established to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can thus be used for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative called OSSI, US breeders can pledge to freely use the seeds bred by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it. "open source" breeders only allow others who buy seeds, to breed it in order to breed their own varieties, and not to sew them immediately - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">At the University of Wisconsin-Madison and OSSI Management Board member Jack Kloppenburg, Professor of Wisconsin-Madison and OSSI Management Board member Jack Kloppenburg are both important for food safety and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds therefore play a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would attempt to use the latter not or only little by breaching seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">"" "Kloppenburg stresses that the" "" "open source" "" "movement is not concerned with genetically modified plants." ""</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seeds," says he and takes on the increasingly frequent fusions in the global agriculture industry, whose recent examples include the mergers of ChemChina and Syngenta and Bayer, which, for example, is offered on farmers markets, should also know that the way that vegetables is bred is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty is not possible without food sovereignty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed initiative are committed to helping others to continue their seeds freely. in contrast, their approach is to patent seed and plant features.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered as the available gene pool due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always available, incessantly shrink.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of the OSSI, employs herself in her doctorate with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about one third of all antitrust features are protected as intellectual property, making it impossible for plant breeders to be used either at all or only difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, such estimates do not exist yet, but experts such as Luby suggest that plants are patented as wheat in even greater style than salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are bred in such a way that they have specifically desired characteristics - from those by which their tastes or their color improve until such, because of which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material is decreasing for breeders by becoming more and more patents. genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse predictable by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail Monsanto-Speaker Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the company advocates the preservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, it contradicts the view that intellectual property has other breeders, since" "" "patents and protection of plant varieties promote innovation." "" "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection does not inhibit innovation, but encourages them by providing more material and expertise to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees that differently: to wait for 20 years until a patent expires, surely does not promote innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait for so long to breed with plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one would have already lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">However, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us, and it is impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and latest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">In all, Morton interferes with the concept of patented plant features: "we do not really create the characteristics themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeders, we finally have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US state Oregon and OSSI board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "who breeds one species, also breeds its own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Whoever believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for their cultivation, herbicides are needed, which breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is exact opposite." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized enterprises (such that move on international markets, but smaller than e.g. Monsanto) patents have patents, they manage to survive the most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they reject the patenting or they hold it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>

<seg id="2681">"" "Morton also believes that breeders would be more innovative because of the avoidance of plant patents:" "" "it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies that patented." ""</seg>

<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, states that conventional bred plants should not be patentable. thus, it appeals against the current practice of the European Patent Office which allows patents on conventionally bred plants.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the newest goals of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still block content on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 5 August, the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports on selfles.</seg>
<seg id="2724">"" "" "" "in August, the network published a position on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities criticised this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region." ""</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains - despite this attack and the mocking of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities which should defend the law, to expose the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, so it was never as important as now.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first licensed website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites over two months, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, arabic-language edition of Huffington Post and Al Jazeera's Qatar-based network for alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>

<seg id="2728">Besides ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada made use of his blog for the distribution of articles and articles, which he writes inaccessible websites and media for Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">"" "" "" "now, the blog, which he established to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government, was itself the aim of an attack." ""</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider on which Ziadas blog is located, on the other hand, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video how the police exercised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles revolve mainly about politics and human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment Ziada said to the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to block is very old but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the blocking of the blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has succeeded in communicating with me the feeling of a siege-condition; a arrest, an attempted murder, an invitation to the National Security Council, the blocking blogs as well as any other web page for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words: my words have influence, if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it for the post of articles to circumvent the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, having blocked it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The courageous go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities closed from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites. these were technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the locking of providers, which was possible by re-hitting the internnet and private surf, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12th we noticed how the block of web pages that VPNs offer began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice points to the government's intention to continue to block and filter content that could have access to Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is additionally exacerbated by the fact that the decision-making decisions are taken behind closed doors, which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis, with which it can proceed in court against these actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government willing to go to censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day after day newspapers report in Brazil with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motives.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "" "" "14-year-old shot in school," "" "Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered," "" "thieves robbed the pharmacy with military weapons," "" "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, Navy and Air Force to Rio." ""</seg>
<seg id="2756">"" "" "" "in the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio in 2017 reached the highest level for 10 years." ""</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organization Global Justice even called upon the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least find the manager of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "the newspaper" "" "Extra" "" "published for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio on August 16 published the article" "" "This is not normal" "", "in which she announced to set up a new section called" "" "War in Rio." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision explained the newspaper so:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report about crimes committed in every major city in the world like murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. all, however, what happens in Rio is published in the section "War in Rio." (...) This is our way of calling: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">"" "" "" "this is the only alternative, so that we as journalists do not close our eyes from cruelty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper stated that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">It is probably the only newspaper in the whole world with a rubrik in a country that does not recognise the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video a journalist of the newspaper explains that, according to the Institute of Internal Security, there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, when it is distorted, can also be used to cover the atrocities of the police, which only shoots and then asks questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose aim is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Oliveira argues against denying violence as a "war."</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education and a historical and self-sufficiency of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">To remember: the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2777">Rio de Janeiro as "the most violent place in Brazil" is wrong: "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil lie according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country. these are the most up-to-date data.</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities are located in the federal state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "if we look at the Mordrates per federal state, Rio is on No.16," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">In addition to the Globo company, the largest media enterprise in South America, which, as Cecília emphasizes, has been repeating the State's security policy for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">This security policy was also part of the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit imposed by the state of Rio in 2003, whose aim is to conquer a favela by using a massive police station and permanently stationed a unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths. however, for several years, after several reports, the UPP, after several reports of chicans and repression against the poor communities, which was supposed to protect the newly created police unit, was increasingly under attack.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux made from one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal questions, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war draws serious consequences for the people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This includes penetration into the territory of a "enemy," where a civilian is an unsharpened point in the landscape and becomes an object for "collateral damage" and "crazy spheres."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War or her, fact is that the residents of the favelas continue to suffer in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2788">One week it is now that the police enkled the mountain with the favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident made headlines: a fruit salesman died as a result of shots that the police had fired from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to Siege Watch, a joint initiative of the peace organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around a million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The East Ghouta region is particularly affected, where an attack on chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition go out on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, those areas controlled by rebels have been besieged outside Damascus, which led to the local population to be dependent on locally produced or through tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through the longlasting blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian volunteers and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, how they can plant their own fungi as a "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms do not belong to the common foods planted in Syria and are only extremely rare in the Syrian cuisine. however, they make them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Directly of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we opted for the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices that has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expressed its relief that it now gains more and more "an awareness."</seg>
<seg id="2814">In order to collect money for the initiative, we use the humanitarian Crowdfunding Platform cando in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to mediate 125 families knowledge to planting fungi, as Dr. Leila leads to Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected goal of around 12,700 €, but will continue to collect donations to cando until Monday, 04 September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Due to the fuel shortage locally produced plastics are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">"" "Dr Leila said Global Voices that they started with the" "" "production of mushrooms from the regions" "" "before they reviewed their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption." ""</seg>
<seg id="2820">Then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub. when this was done, they used a larger tub. and so on.</seg>
<seg id="2821">"" "now they have designed a" "" "educational farm" "" "for the region." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed fungi everywhere in East Ghouta free of charge.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested in Portugal on October 21st in many districts and demanded justice for the victims of fires that were grassed in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the government last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fractures spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June Pedrógão Grande took a similar tragedy where 64 deaths and more than 200 injured were injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest surveillance system, which monitors the forest areas via satellite photos alone, approximately 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon region.</seg>

<seg id="2854">The environmental organisation Quercus attracted attention that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of easily flammable wood, like in a vicious circle, continue to expand after fires of this species.</seg>
<seg id="2855">These problems are added that the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October, as inhabitants, sought information or tried to contact relatives, offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: she used the own civil protection data using the fogos.pt application and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so crucial in this fateful weekend in October that the server failed to withstand the rush of 400,000 users who persecuted the fires. this included the website more than half a million hits.</seg>

<seg id="2874">Two years earlier, a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mujahedin groupings that had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. thus Afghanistan has become a land of terror and despair.</seg>
<seg id="2875">At the same time, Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara in the province of Ghazni in Central-Afghanistan for the last time with his family during dinner.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even though his mother did not say so at that time, she knew she would not see her son very long - maybe even more.</seg>
<seg id="2877">In the dawn the boy was supposed to break.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tug.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat party dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and suddenly a lot of Hazara felt safe.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred on the Hazara, came closer and closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf found himself again in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a couple of years he worked in a coal mine. the work was hard and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his low wages and went to Iran. once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortars that were heavier than himself, in order to earn his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At that time as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"" "" "" "it was really tough," "" "Asharaf reminded in an interview with Global Voices." "" "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the building site where we also worked." ""</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services and no heating there. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we did not get frozen at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years Asharaf left his life without Papiere in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">In the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time Asharaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day eating to aid.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high awareness quotas. it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers have in the country are disastrous.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the large majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000" "" "special recording centres" "". "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian Law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to an admission center if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can go down for months after registration of the asylum request.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who don't have money for accommodation either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unrestrained lifestyles helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After several years of working in the construction sector, Asharaf put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to the official estimates, around 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Over the past few years, some of Afghans have created companies, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his Restaurant Orient Experience, where the waiters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant deals with the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek courts the history of their trip to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a Sushi Restaurant in Rome are also Afghan.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Asharafs's goals however reach far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retail trade and aim back to the country that he had forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "where there is a risk, there are also opportunities," "" "says Asharaf with a smile." "" "I want to invest in Afghanistan." ""</seg>

<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen report is an international snapshot showing challenges, victories and emerging trends in worldwide internet-rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament reviews a draft bill that foresees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after registration with a government authority.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users would have to be able to use social networks to register their full name and ID number within six months after successful law decision on the authority's website.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Anyone missed this step could be sentenced to six months of prison sentence or a penalty of punishment.</seg>
<seg id="2935">"" "" "" "the law, which was applied by sixty members of Parliament, is currently in place with the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there." ""</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "in May, another member of the Parliament submitted a legislative proposal to be introduced in the tougher penalties for the allegation of the president or a high officials." ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under the law proposal, such a deed, however, would be punished with jail and fines, as legal experts of Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">"" "" "" "if the law is passed, this can mean up to three years" "" "imprisonment for the condemned." ""</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would reinforce a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger anyway for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian policemen, demonstrating violence against demonstrators demonstrating against the military coup that had led to the tense of elected President Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan waited, just like over 700 Protestants arrested in the same incident, four years in prison for a trial.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently his trial was postponed on May 20, because the prison administration failed to bring the accused from prison to the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan is threatening the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, e.g. weapons possession, illegal assembly, murder and damaging murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a criminal court in Giza addressed two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-barbary. they were accused of their reporting on the pro-Morsi seats on Raba'a Al-Adwiya square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The court also reduced the punishments of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested at the previously mentioned incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activists hears to cut-through documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, who is co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaal and the Global Voices Advocacy project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia has been interrogated mainly to a continuous action plan. bespoke plan comes from the President of the Republic, who, according to the plan, expressly supports a controversial draft law, which would ensure business people and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption accused officials Amnesty, provided they return all unlawful funds.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on April 21, published on the Nawaat website, sheds light on how the pre-winning plans for the support of the legislation will look like.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia denied the naming of his sources under indication of Article 11 of the Tunisian Press Code, which journalists received the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, at the District Court in Tunis on 9th May, he appeared as a witness in the case.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force the users of social media to present their identification?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to the new provisions of the information offices of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China need a permit before writing or sharing news in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">It is also stated in the rules that registration will be required with full real name.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts assume that by this the elimination of anonymous commentaries within social networks shall be reached. it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2956">"" "" "" "Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to only selectively enforce these regulations to protect citizen journalism and its independence." ""</seg>
<seg id="2957">Do we then see ourselves in "WeChat"?</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">May the state censorship of Russia blocked the access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">According to Roskomnadzor, WeChat has failed to register to the provincial government as the "organiser of information distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a law from 2014, thanks to which the Russian government implements a list of online services that organize the publication of the information. the law also allows the government to make use of said services for removal of content and to force them on request for the termination of user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These websites are currently websites such as Vkontakte and Odnoklassniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the Image Board 2.ch.hk, the email service mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish Court has blocked Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court ordered Wikipedias in Turkey, after Wikipedia's administrators refused to delete two English-speaking articles, the declarations that Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
