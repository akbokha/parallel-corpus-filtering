that is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times rep@@ orter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long before anyone heard about Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he was un@@ spectacular that the N@@ SA had illeg@@ ally listened to teleph@@ ones by Americans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation in which the CIA literally handed dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter did not like ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for almost 10 years , the government has identified ris@@ ers and called upon him to call his alleged sources . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condem@@ n whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and to ti@@ ck@@ le journalists .
according to the first constitutional record , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the cour@@ ageous ones that they disclose .
so when the government sli@@ pped into tears , he did something that many cour@@ ageous rep@@ or@@ ters did before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to prison .
but then , just days before the process , something extraordinary happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , though they believed in years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped to tears . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , the rep@@ or@@ ters and sources can always hide less .
instead of separ@@ ating and cr@@ acking into statements , that could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , his teleph@@ ones kept secret ,
just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , his loans , and even travel information with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to den@@ ounce Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and cr@@ acking suspected source .
unfortunately , this is just one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all US governments before him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government ranks too much of their work as a secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist .
so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional record , because the government has more and more possibilities to pi@@ onate all .
but just as the government allows the government to circum@@ vent the rights of rep@@ or@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and indeed , they can do it from the moment they contact , rather than in hin@@ d@@ sight , in the witness stand .
today there is communication software that has not yet existed when Ris@@ en had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such technology is a Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source revision system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower that was originally developed by the internet @-@ famous Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is now being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation .
instead of sending an email , go to a news site , just like that of the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information , just as with any common contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the relevant news agency has access .
so the government can no longer obtain information secre@@ tly , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outs@@ et .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is however only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new es@@ pi@@ on@@ age technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze us all .
it &apos;s up to us to ensure that not only technology sectors such as Edward Snow@@ den have a chance to bring mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers ,
who wants to report about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the supply of soldiers and reporting from over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environment worker , the alarm to the contam@@ inated water of F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall street Insider who war@@ ns us before the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes , but to protect our constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 , the biggest data le@@ ck of history was released . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Papers &quot; revealed that rich and powerful &#93; &#91; have hidden enormous sum@@ s in tax ha@@ v@@ ens &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; This week we were asked by news about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a little insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Fon@@ sec@@ a Mos@@ sack and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous enterprise . can you set up this ? &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s letter box companies has in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is said that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ list .
now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who are nervous for the next release , and the next revealed documents .
now that sounds like the plot of a Agent@@ enth@@ r@@ ill@@ ers or a John Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems we@@ eping away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we do that ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and this affects all of us .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal .
throughout the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens , are used by some few to hide and disgu@@ ise their wealth -- something we have been discussing and reve@@ aling for ten years .
I think many people seem to be very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these containers .
it can be very difficult for prosec@@ uting and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what thing is .
I find it interesting also that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
pres@@ um@@ ably , because there were no prominent Americans , who occurred in these revel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal .
now it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
however , through the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a data le@@ ck of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , in some US states less information is needed to provide less information to found a company than to get a library card .
this type of transparency in the United States has allowed employees of school districts to rip @-@ off school@@ children .
it allows sc@@ ams to rip off especially sus@@ cep@@ tible investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator gave himself as an African Minister who wanted to bring out susp@@ icious money to the United States in order to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really sho@@ cked that everyone made suggestions for a lawyer to our investig@@ ator how he could transfer his money .
none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was given money to anybody . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as individual cases .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian , embro@@ iled in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works , established by corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to cope with this , we need to change the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this may sound very tri@@ b@@ ous as if we could not do anything against it ; as if nothing had ever changed , as if there is always the rich and powerful .
but as a native optim@@ ist I see that things have begun to change .
over the past few years , we have seen suggestions for more transparency regarding the owners of companies .
the topic took political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU regi@@ sters in central regi@@ sters on a national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the United States lag@@ ged behind .
representatives of both parties have introduced a draft bill in both Par@@ li@@ ament@@ ary Cham@@ bers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind pseu@@ do companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need executives in the economy to stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end by laws this kind of in@@ transparent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together , we can finally end the in@@ transparent , which now enables this sort of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing .
this is the story of how I almost kid@@ n@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
a day after I had finished my design studies , I made an end .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep ton@@ ight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing even worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans . I don &apos;t want to land in the boot of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard myself saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I lay in bed , I star@@ ed on the blank@@ et and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what did I get there ?
a wild stranger sleeps in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what if he is crazy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got such a fear that I stepped out of bed , sli@@ pping on to@@ es at the door , and shut down my bedroom door .
but he was not mad at all .
we are still in touch .
the work of art he bought from me today hang@@ s in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has changed my point of view completely .
perhaps the people who were sold to me as stran@@ gers in childhood , actually friends who were just waiting to be discovered ?
to house people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s take a time leap , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost pl@@ ain@@ ly , my ro@@ omm@@ ate runs out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create it to transform fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new ro@@ omm@@ ate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could make something for it . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , including a mattress and breakfast each morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ha ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we created a website and established so &quot; air matt@@ resses and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor .
they found it great , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham O@@ mel@@ ette tast@@ ed completely different because we made it for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the lock , Brian and I started .
had we just discovered that at the same time we could find new friends and pay our rent ?
things came into play .
my former ro@@ omm@@ ate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if one could make a business concept .
so we presented to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people publish public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors one closes when visiting .
over the Internet , they can invite other people to stay overnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this will be the next big thing ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we waited for the mis@@ sile to ign@@ ite .
but they are not .
no one who is still at comfort would invest in a shop that allows stran@@ gers to sleep in homes of other people .
why ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because as children all have learned that stran@@ gers are dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if one has a problem , one contempl@@ ates the things that one can do well . we could design .
at the Kunst@@ akademie , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it is the total experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who never met before .
can design do something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree of trust we inher@@ ited .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left sitting neigh@@ bor .
this quiet sli@@ pping of panic , whom you feel now -- is exactly what hosts feel when they first open the door .
for the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
this is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
just so , who now really has Al Gor@@ es mobile ?
could you please pro@@ claim on Twitter that he is candidates for the office of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail about this experiment ?
what if your neigh@@ bor had once imag@@ ined with his name ; if he told where he came from , how his dog or his children are hot ?
imagine you had 150 app@@ rais@@ als who all say : &quot; he can hold really very well @-@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you would have to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust .
at the beginning we have done some things wrong .
it was hard for the people to leave negative jud@@ gements .
in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had handed over their assess@@ ments before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are about age and home .
little surprising we entr@@ ust the human being most , which are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting when you add the reputation of a person -- in our case by jud@@ gements .
if you have less than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation bo@@ ils simil@@ arities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
in addition , we learned that trust depends on how much you get .
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is rather not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tol@@ le works of art in your apartment ! I make holidays with my family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can you create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against stran@@ gers .
what we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to cast off these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
first , unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third , a need that was previously un@@ covered .
the business is running very well for us .
of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate or have been devast@@ ated .
hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with my customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the foref@@ ront when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts already when I just think about it .
the dis@@ appointment that you hear in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had ever been a problem .
for men have trusted each other to be right .
when confidence works , there can be won@@ dro@@ us results .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his judgement :
&quot; perfect house for travelers who are inclined to heart attacks because of sed@@ entary activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save life even though they don &apos;t really know one thing .
they drive one in their own car to the hospital when you die and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lon@@ ely , they bring books by .
they can even stay longer without calcul@@ ating extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so , of course , not every stay exp@@ ires .
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
it is about economic trading .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now just call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ten@@ ant industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing is not justified . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people place a part of themselves openly , and that changes everything .
when you travel nowadays , this is to be compared to fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if in any place that one visits , a group would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one at a pub @-@ pent@@ ine quarter from which one has never heard before ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would shape dwell@@ ings from scratch to share ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of shared participation ?
I imagine cities that enable us to society and relationships instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and de@@ preci@@ ation .
in South Korea capital Seoul , this project has already begun . lots of parking spaces which belonged to the government ,
were now offered residents . students who were looking for a place to stay ,
were convey@@ ed to people whose children were out@@ sour@@ ced . inc@@ ub@@ ator programs were started ,
to be able to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host .
so the idea does not seem to be so crazy as it was taught us .
we have not re@@ invented the wheel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hospitality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was also a good thing before . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were similar websites before us .
so why did our work exactly ?
apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of confidence .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find it ast@@ o@@ unding ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da passes by me .
we know of course that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use for design soon .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a belie@@ ver ? an expert ?
perhaps even a sister .
or oppressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply delay the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people that look like me .
a study concluded that 80 % of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ pres@@ so , extra with cream .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a car@@ r@@ ots @-@ fitness fan@@ atics ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not as Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born so .
I made a decision .
when I was 17 years old , I made the decision to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as hom@@ os@@ ex@@ ual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist girl@@ friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time , it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , compared to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt myself to a perfect and un@@ att@@ ain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents passi@@ vely .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the cor@@ an .
I read it , thought , ques@@ tioned , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow devot@@ ion that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to cry .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
had you ever feeling that someone you perceive you fully understands , and yet somehow love ?
so it feels like that .
later I married and started , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then that terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Break@@ ing News &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes fle@@ w in buildings , people jump@@ ed from the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical failure ?
my shock turned quickly into ou@@ trage .
why should we do this ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I switched to the television channel and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Eastern ancest@@ ry ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bs Mec@@ ca ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh , my God .
it is not only my country being attacked , but in the N@@ u the actions of others transformed me from a citizen into a susp@@ ect .
on the same day we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and begin the post@@ graduate studies .
I remember how I ro@@ de -- when we went sil@@ ently -- so deep it went into my seat , and I feared for the first time to be recognized as Muslims .
we moved this night into our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations that said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be watch@@ ful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ay in good lighted places , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t bo@@ ther you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it was Friday this week -- the day when Muslims gather to pray .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the war@@ nings answered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ fil@@ tered and I also heard attacks on Muslims or from people that were held for Muslims , drag@@ ged and struck .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who had attacked this country attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have got the anger of the people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
these are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nowadays we can actually hear people saying : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want Muslims to ban@@ ish and close Mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the US .
only the question arises : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour is seen only under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is false .
Muslims , like all other Americans , are not a tumor in the body of the US , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , hel@@ pers and Olympi@@ oni@@ ans .
will the closure of mos@@ ques of America make safer ?
there may be a few parking spots , but not stop terror .
the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to toler@@ ant people of other fai@@ ths more toler@@ ant , and to show greater ci@@ vic participation .
and as a leader of the police in Washington , DC recently told me : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
in the radic@@ alization process one has found that he begins online . when first , the person is cut off from their community , even from their family so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts may make a bra@@ in@@ washing that leads to the terrorists be the true Muslims , and anyone who abh@@ ors their behavior and their ideology is a tra@@ itor or off@@ ended by faith .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we have to stop people to go to the mos@@ que .
some people still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Kor@@ an .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imagination , when one recogni@@ zes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x cl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when looking at them , she does not drive what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality , which let them read these things into the scrip@@ tures .
an outstanding I@@ mam recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she pret@@ ended to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy with whom she spoke , she gave silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injus@@ tice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that gave sense to their anger , it was a main objective for the instrument@@ alization of extre@@ mi@@ sts which promised her a solution .
this I@@ mam was re @-@ establishing the connection with God and His church .
instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed her constructive ways of real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we are more accepting an author@@ it@@ arian system of government , conformity and prejudi@@ ce .
a study shows : if you submit to test persons news , in which neg@@ atively reports were reported on Muslims , they voted rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as circumcis@@ ion of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look when the mood against Muslims rises up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up of the Iraq war and during two periods of elec@@ toral periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
it can actually be a tool for manipul@@ ating the public to hollow out the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear makes us all .
in the assignment of collective deb@@ ts , it is not only about having to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple , living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sport@@ sman .
he was talented at the dental faculty , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , generous human being whom she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his res@@ ume . she was amazed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when did I become such an accomplished young man from my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neigh@@ bor , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting in the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as in a execution after he had post@@ pon@@ ed statements against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he spent eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or were we safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one thing that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely prac@@ tise our religion .
we chose the mos@@ que .
with our son in the nur@@ ser@@ y , we drove sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took him out , and went out of my shoes , and went into the bones of the bones , and what I saw left me .
the hall was completely filled .
then the I@@ mam opened an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the congregation were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at this moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had given courage and compassion to panic and prejudi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you go safe on number ?
or will you join to those who mean : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what do you say to those who perhaps say that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with drau@@ ght , working in a cl@@ assy think tank , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , do not dec@@ eive yourself . I am completely normal .
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
if you look at Muslims all over the world , and I did that with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want ordinary things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
if people appear like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a milli@@ ar@@ den@@ ier .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before air @-@ par@@ ing le@@ aps into our social awareness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the FRA@@ C Centre in France has built a six @-@ meter tower of 1 500 bricks live in front of the audience . a few years ago , they started to fly with rop@@ es .
connecting flight devices achieve high speed and acceleration in confin@@ ed spaces .
you can also build up self @-@ resist@@ able structures .
they have learned to bear loads , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally respond to natural laws .
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to transc@@ end the limits of the possible in the autonomous plane .
to make a system autonomous , it must know collec@@ tively where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . that enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , an editor of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
external commands can be &quot; started &quot; and &quot; land &quot; on the highest level .
this is a so @-@ called rear @-@ starter ,
an air@@ plane trying to beat two flies with a fl@@ ap .
like other starter @-@ tri@@ ppers , it is efficient in the forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations .
in contrast to most star@@ ters , it can float and has great advantages when starting and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always one swe@@ eping page .
a limitation of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind this is that the aircraft no matter what position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
08.@@ 11.2015 &#124; Des@@ perate House@@ wives
during our research , we are often confronted with basic abstract questions that emerge at the heart of the matter .
such a question would be , for example , what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that meet to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pil@@ ots were able to fly remote @-@ controlled aircraft flying only two mo@@ vable parts : a propeller and a rear ru@@ d@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we discovered that flies with just one function . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the mon@@ osp@@ in , the mechan@@ ically easiest remote aircraft . it was invented recently .
it has only one moving part , a propeller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and lateral ru@@ des , no further actuators or control surfaces , only one propeller .
although it is mechanical , it happens very much in the inside , so that it can fly stable and move in the room everywhere .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tail@@ gate . to get it to fly , I have to throw it correctly .
the lik@@ eli@@ hood of throwing it correctly if everyone is watching is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was fil@@ med last night .
if the mon@@ osp@@ in is an exercise in pleasure , this machine is here , the bus head with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is symmet@@ rical .
therefore it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
as a result , he receives the exceptional ability ,
move in the room in all directions , no matter which direction it is rot@@ ated or even as it rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some can be imag@@ ined in models , the rest is lear@@ nt directly from flying .
let &apos;s look at it .
if aircraft are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate two propeller aircraft engines .
this rot@@ ates clo@@ ck@@ wise
and the other counter@@ clo@@ ck@@ wise .
when you build it , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ copter .
but if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller fails , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly even if restricted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will now demonstrate this by making one half air@@ worthy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last demonstration will examine synthetic path@@ ways .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took commercial micro @-@ Quad@@ copter - each one weighs less than one sli@@ ce of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . that is why there is no upper limit .
hopefully , these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine there would like to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology .
for types such as us lies the wage in the development and the act of creativity .
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to shape them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes were cir@@ cl@@ ed each other in a very far distant galax@@ y , and so the mass of three s@@ uns in a tenth of a second transformed into pure energy .
this short moment they were shining bri@@ ghter than all the stars in all galax@@ ies of the whole of us known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not set up their energy in the form of light --
we finally talk of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time @-@ structures themselves and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us arrange the events in the first place .
1.3 billion years ago , it was just a multi @-@ cell life on Earth .
since then the earth has brought about a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God is standing on us -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of specially mu@@ tig@@ ers -- R@@ ai Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a giant laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which are caused by colli@@ ding black holes .
most of them considered them crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work , they built the detector from Lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ ometer gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves observ@@ atory .
in the following period , the precision of Lig@@ o increased significantly , which greatly improved the recognition performance .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 Lig@@ o was started for a last test run to clarify some minor , stub@@ born problems .
on 14 September 2015 , just a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ro@@ amed through the earth through the earth .
you went through me and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the far@@ ewell to my death @-@ sick father .
basically , that was the fruits of my life .
all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes and her through observ@@ atories like Lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals .
a gra@@ vit@@ ational shaft is a ru@@ ff@@ ening in the structure of space and time .
when passing the shaft , the room and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and moved into the other .
for illustr@@ ative purposes , lec@@ turers in courses lead to rel@@ ativity @-@ theory often a really al@@ ber@@ n@@ ous dance .
&quot; stretch and dust , stretch and dust . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ cul@@ ous .
on 14 September , for example , each of us was stretched and pun@@ ished by the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is 20 no@@ uns according to the comm@@ a followed by a 1 .
with a five @-@ kilomet@@ re laser detector , and that is already absurd , this length would have to be measured precisely to less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nuclear nucle@@ us . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are enormous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ ci@@ sts are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
THOR@@ NE published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to claim that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell .
this is quite practical , because so you can customize a picture or map of things by seeing the light coming from multiple points around you .
in tones it is different .
audi@@ ble tones have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you :
about your child &apos;s face .
instead we listen to certain properties such as pitch and height , rhythm and volume to connect to the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now is Alice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and Bob breaks it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; du@@ mmer Bob &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
with them we cannot make simple pictures of objects in space .
but by paying attention to changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o , the measured frequencies lie in the audi@@ ble area .
so if we convert wave pattern in sound , we can literally hear the universe literally .
listening to the gra@@ vit@@ ation can tell us about a lot about the colli@@ sion of two black holes , which my colleague Scott has been busy for quite a long time .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , circular just : w@@ up@@ p !
turn the two bodies very quickly , you hear the same cir@@ cus with an additional key change . that sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a kind of movement pattern , im@@ printed in the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget - Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render of sound &#93; somebody , who knows what to hear , recogni@@ zes this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold sun mass , which rot@@ ate roughly as fast as the sticks of your mixer .
AA : let &apos;s briefly consider what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 s@@ uns , the other with a mass of 36 s@@ uns , revol@@ ve around one hundred times per second before they colli@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we heard it .
it consists of the permanent meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o opens a new way to research the universe as it has never been possible before .
on this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
we can &apos;t see much in all -- practically or basically -- not .
a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ole hotels explo@@ de in super@@ nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . from them we have learned a lot about the universe .
but the exciting physical events happen at the core , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see , because these are opaque .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Ur@@ b@@ ang : I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them , since the jungle is covered by its own after@@ g@@ low .
using gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen , which we will never see , and of which we have no idea . things we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt which we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says : me : the kind of stars who produce black holes as Lig@@ o ob@@ serves them are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from pre@@ historic times . the black holes are the Sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ no@@ chen for our ar@@ che@@ ological work , so to speak .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different view of the events in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge is to be as bold as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and cir@@ cus of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories - a new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of which I was afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; Yes . &quot;
did I want to talk to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start acting ?
no , no , no , but yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I feared , my fear removed .
my fear to keep spe@@ eches , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has changed my life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain yes that changed my life to an unexpected way . it started with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Em@@ erson . and Em@@ erson , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estimates &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estimate , I need milk for my be@@ ak @-@ cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this yes was the beginning
from then on , I swear to always play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I am doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I am not perfect , but I am very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family .
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I understood completely that the &quot; Yes &quot; say to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I &apos;m a writer . I think things aw@@ aken , wake up to life .

I create TV . I produce TV .
I do TV , in great style .
in this TV @-@ season I am responsible for adding a 70 @-@ hour program to the world .
four television programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are in production at the same time .
each broadcast offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
let us say five .
a new episode every nine days four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars television , four television programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts that are simultaneously in production , times four , 16 epis@@ odes : sc@@ andal , 15 epis@@ odes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 epis@@ odes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours Television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series run on Thursday evening .
all over the world my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts that I created myself , and not just produced , so still pure . I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans around camp fire and tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that burn around the world .
do you know who is still doing it ?
no one , therefore I am a Titan .

I don &apos;t want to im@@ press you with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think if the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you so that all of you who work so hard , whether you are managing a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a household , take me seriously when I talk about work so you understand that I am not just around the computer and fant@@ asi@@ ere , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it &apos;s not dre@@ aming about a dream job .
it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , everything sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I deep@@ en the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it is as if I set up troops as I painted on a canvas .
as you dream of a high tone , run a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , funny and distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and mother@@ ly , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing about it is the sum@@ s .
there is such a change in me when work is running well .
a bu@@ zz starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy street , I could go for it forever .
many people take when I declare to them the sum@@ ming that I am talking about writing that writing gives me joy .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does it .
but the bu@@ zz -- when I started working and working and working and doing , building , creating and working , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ s , this energy .
the sum@@ ming is more than writing .
the bu@@ zz is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a sum@@ s , you can no longer strive for size .
the feeling of not being able to be different than striving for size no matter what price .
this is called the sum@@ s .
or maybe it also means being a work@@ a@@ holic .
perhaps it is called geni@@ us .
perhaps ego is called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I just know that I am not made for failure , and I only know that I love the sum@@ s .
I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to put it into question .
to make one clear : the more successful I become , the more epis@@ odes , the more epis@@ odes , the more work there are , the more things are , the more I am writing history , the more I am writing .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the country I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the mar@@ sh , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s .
I like this bu@@ zz . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the bu@@ zz . I &apos;m the bu@@ zz .
am I only this bu@@ zz ?
and then the mar@@ sh stops .

the mar@@ sh stops .
now my three daughters are ac@@ custom@@ ed to the truth that their mo@@ m is a single work stit@@ cher .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my mo@@ m will not be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Em@@ erson says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estimate , I want to go to the shore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ s ceased .
the bu@@ zz of the engine stopped .
I didn &apos;t love my work anymore . the engine was off .
the sum@@ s did not come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same title work , 15 hours @-@ days , well @-@ worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ating , a Titan does not sleep , doesn &apos;t give up , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me was silence .
four television programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a Show @-@ Titan ,
everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz and the sum@@ s I was .
so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ ade ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how@@ l you , stup@@ id author Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you are doing it , you are working to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill G@@ ates , one loves one another and that gives one the bu@@ zz when you know the sum@@ s , and knows how the sum@@ ming feels when you stop the sum@@ ming , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart ce@@ ases , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; South @-@ state wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presents me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way out , late and she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ um , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no , when two things become aware of me :
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , I must say yes to everything and second , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; valu@@ ables . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it does not call anyone more &quot; estimate . &quot;
when is this happening ?
I miss it when I &apos;m Titan and my sum@@ s sof@@ ter , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ um , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say : &quot; yes . &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of hum@@ ming , I can &apos;t do anything except to go out .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the country I create , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist .
everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and fier@@ y kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it goes to letting go , or whatever the girl gets in &quot; Die Eis@@ köni@@ gin &quot; .
everywhere peace and simplicity is everywhere .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me sol@@ ves .
a mental door opens and an energy shift comes in .
and that &apos;s not right away , but it happens it happens .
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz is coming back slowly .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the bu@@ zz , but a bu@@ zz .
and now I feel like I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the bu@@ zz , the sum@@ ming , the Tit@@ an@@ ens@@ um@@ men , this is just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I &apos;m describing the use of broad@@ casts and TV @-@ hours and how functional my brain is , then I for@@ got what the real sum@@ s are .
the sum is not a force and it is not working @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real sum@@ s depend on love .
the bu@@ zz is the current that comes from the lust of life .
the real sum@@ s are self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real sum@@ s ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks imposed , the expec@@ tation and pressure .
the real sum@@ s are simple and original .
the real sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ per@@ ed the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself as a work@@ a@@ holic from any blame .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice if I want to hear the sum@@ s again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not at odds as to how to work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I am better at work than at home .
this acknowled@@ gement is painful , because what kind of man would prefer to be as home ?
well yes , I .
hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
we move around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we do small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we sh@@ atter soap bub@@ bles .
I mainly feel sti@@ ff , ab@@ sent and confused .
I always take my phone .
but it is ok .
my children show me how to live and the bu@@ zz of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever heard about playing ?
you can also say yes , if your child wishes to play with you .
maybe you keep me for nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dream woman .
there you are right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at the most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something different .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bird or bis@@ cu@@ it replaces me .
and talks about my teen@@ age daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , more it does not need .
each can get 15 minutes on the piece , even in a bad mood day !
15 minutes a day !
no mobile phone , no clothes , no distr@@ action .
the day is short : dinner , the kids finished ready .
but 15 minutes are in !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the bu@@ zz of having a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about pleasure ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out and store it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I win . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more .
15 minutes a piece , why not indul@@ ge in 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz came back in my free time . the bu@@ zz seems to return if I &apos;m not working .
working does not work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown mel@@ ody , it fills me and my soul . I am inviting me to new ideas .
I like the bu@@ zz , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz is not me ... no more .
soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
now that is my bu@@ zz .
the tot@@ ality of life .
the bu@@ zz of love .
the sum of the work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful for that .
it is my sn@@ u@@ ff that I &apos;m a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan who plays a trip to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my camp@@ fire still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the more clear my head is .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the bu@@ zz . the country I create , the marathon , which I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high sound , the mar@@ sh , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the other , the real sum@@ s : the bu@@ zz of life .
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , engaging , naked and new feeling of life expands in me . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel this sum@@ ming , the more I know who I am .
I &apos;m a writer . I think things out , I aw@@ aken you to life .
that is part of the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am neuro@@ sur@@ geon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to deal with human trag@@ e@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a serious stroke or after an accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing .
after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability .
that is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon .
what is a functional neuro@@ sur@@ geon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions .
for sure , they have heard of one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; low @-@ brain stimulation . &quot; in doing so , one implant@@ ing an electro@@ de deeply in the brain to influence the neur@@ ons switching circuits so that the neurolog@@ ical function is improved .
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Park@@ inson &apos;s disease , suffering from severe tre@@ mb@@ ling and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are close to it .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
I often supplied patients with traum@@ atic brain trau@@ ma .
you have to imagine that cran@@ ium @-@ brain trau@@ ma sw@@ ells the brain and raises the cran@@ ial pressure .
to save life , you have to reduce the skull pressure .
sometimes you have to remove a part s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist to analyse the brain mass .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to grow cells from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , moisture and the surroundings to let it thri@@ ve .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François created .
he saw that under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ri@@ pe cells .
perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are imm@@ ort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they shared themselves slowly and after a few weeks , they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Double@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our cer@@ eb@@ ell@@ um cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the fet@@ us stage they care for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay for us ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so sure .
but one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells in the same way as Jean @-@ François did .
and then mark them colored to be able to follow them in the brain .
in the last step we im@@ planted them at the removal point of the same Individu@@ al .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we are implant@@ ing these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen when we have the same cells transplan@@ ted into damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario we planted the cells in a healthy brain , and we watched that they disappeared completely after a few weeks as if they were taken again , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we added an injury to and im@@ planted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained intact -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could see under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been im@@ planted .
the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells we dy@@ ed in vitro , in culture .
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a mon@@ key to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual skill task .
they had to take food p@@ ellets from a tray .
they made them very good .
when they had reached a stable level of skill , we injured the motor skills range in the motor@@ ic Cort@@ ex .
then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand .
just as it happened in humans , they spontan@@ eously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of three @-@ dimensional brain mechanisms . they recover at a certain degree , just like the ape .
when we were certain that the mon@@ key had reached its level of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted its own cells .
on the left you see the mon@@ key that spontan@@ eously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from before the injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now see when we im@@ planted the cells : the same mon@@ key , two months after the rice plant@@ ation .
I can tell you that these were also very exciting results for us .
since that time , we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can fre@@ eze it and use it later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ plant it in humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need it . &quot;
I definitely will .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human beings .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill up about two kilo@@ grams of papers and forms to cross this type of studies .
BG : this is understand@@ able , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue to look further into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authorities allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply this to a multi @-@ cent@@ ric study .
you must first really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it &apos;s safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for your visit at TED and that you have told us about it .
BG : thank you .
it is not a question of democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course .
we do not see democracy as the frag@@ ile plant it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider it as imm@@ utable entity .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his big neigh@@ bors in Beijing have undoubtedly shown that it is possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth while policy remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact democracy is d@@ wind@@ ling with us , in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clear to me as a finance minister in the Euro Group -- that the democratic process of our country -- our elections - could not influence the austerity programs that were realised in Greece .
at this moment I thought that there could be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my junk@@ y friends who told me repeatedly that democracy would aboli@@ sh if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save the democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ ensive democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for without democracy our societies are mixed , our future glo@@ om and our great new technologies are w@@ asted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the subject of waste , I would like to draw you to an interesting contradiction which currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin summit parad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a top is known to you . you know and recognize him as the denberg denberg who thro@@ ws his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the debt of debt ,
but only a few recognize his twin .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the weal@@ thy as@@ parag@@ us and corporations , but which are too anxi@@ ous to invest in it , where it would be productive and in@@ comes with which one could carry out the debt burden and also produce all the things that humanity is urg@@ ently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
in the past 3 months , in the United States , in England and in the Eurozone , 3.4 billion US dollars were invested in all the wealth produced goods , such as industrial facilities , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on .
3.4 tril@@ lion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until you compare it with the 5,@@ 1 tril@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to infl@@ ate the stock markets and ex@@ ert real estate prices .
thus debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin summit which does not equ@@ ate itself through the usual market mechanisms .
the result are stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe labour @-@ free , and consequently a low overall economic demand that is fear@@ ing the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors which , like in an infinite loop , advoc@@ ate the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which could be true that his son would kill him when he is grown up ,
invol@@ unt@@ arily leads the circumstances that lead to the fact that O@@ edi@@ pus k@@ ills him .
this is my hair with capitalism --
his extremely wast@@ eful Art All the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents , and to finance especially all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth .
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government .
the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy closed naturally too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to reduce the importance of ath@@ en@@ ic democracy because of these exclusi@@ ons .
the decisive part of the Ath@@ en@@ ic democracy was and is , that it included the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of speech , but more important and decisive , which they gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same vote weigh@@ ting in questions of the state of state .
the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy hasn &apos;t kept a long time --
like a candle that sh@@ ines very bright , it is burned quickly .
however , today &apos;s liberal democr@@ acies have not their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers .
the liberal democracy only came up as a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone .
in today &apos;s democr@@ acies , since the time that this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two is taking place by gradually shifting politics and dis@@ em@@ bodies it .
do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not up to a de@@ generation of its DNA .
it is because it is possible to be in the government these days , and still not in power , because the power is immig@@ rated from politics to the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my hatred with capitalism .
when you think about it , it is like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es , which so sustain@@ ably the animals , of which they nour@@ ished , dec@@ im@@ ated that they are star@@ ved at the end .
similarly , it is with the economy that politics has so far kan@@ ni@@ b@@ alized that it itself hur@@ ts itself through the self @-@ created economic crisis itself . the power of corporations grows , political goods are de@@ valued , ine@@ quality rises , the general economic demand falls and the directors of the corporations are too anxi@@ ous to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; of democracy , the higher the twin summit , and the greater the w@@ asting of human labour power and prosperity of humanity .
if this is true , it is obvious that we have to re@@ unite the politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; ret@@ ains control , as in ancient Athens , except for the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good .
the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only reg@@ ain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new types of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : aboli@@ shing the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers by automation and robot .
the problem is , as long as the economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin summit more higher , the waste generated , and social conflicts go deeper , just like it -- very soon , as I believe -- comes in countries like China .
we must therefore re@@ organize the economy and re@@ unite the sectors of economy and politics , and take care that we democr@@ ati@@ se the re@@ unified sector , otherwise we end up in a disease surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that lets the film &quot; matrix &quot; appear as a documentary .
the question is therefore not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that of &quot; matrix , &quot; in which machines serve the human beings and the people put their energy into the research of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks the meaning of life indul@@ ge .
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so what do it mean , how could it look like having this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star Trek &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples .
in the company : ask yourself a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from a job to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which you are working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company .
then all income derived from capital and of rede@@ em@@ ing and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no distinction between those who belong to the companies , but who do not work in it , and employees who work there , but who do not belong there . no exchange between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no rising twin summit .
in the field of global political economy : imagine that our national currencies would have a free vac@@ ant exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interests of all humanity .
imagine that the whole world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; cos@@ mos , &quot; and each government pays the sum equal to the trade defic@@ it or the surplus value of the country , into a common fund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment is rare . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
today , we have them , especially against the background of a re@@ united politics and economy .
the world I describe you is at the same time liber@@ t@@ arian , in which she pre@@ fers privileged persons , and mar@@ x@@ is@@ tically because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and key@@ n@@ esian , global key@@ n@@ esian .
but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
we will aw@@ aken in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - a similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands , and we do it better democratic .
thank you .
Bruno ban@@ ani PRO@@ MET@@ H@@ EU@@ S Hip @-@ Short
you describe yourself in your biography itself as liberal Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and business is ... do we not do this , technological development will generate such a massive decline in overall economic demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers describes as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by transferring this crisis from part of the Earth to the next , as we are experiencing it , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our democr@@ acies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , Marx is absolutely relevant ,
just as Hay@@ ek , I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that is why I am completely confused .
BG : actually , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t wir@@ l , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophi@@ cal explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Ein@@ stein who said it . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers , you have said very clearly what you think of the West &apos;s view of China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democr@@ acies we have the appearance of democracy .
as I said in my talk , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most plays , -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic zone .
in a sense , if I can say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to England of the 19th century today .
for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is an error , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what we can see now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China is now propos@@ ing to do what the West has done for itself in the 19th century , sm@@ elling tremend@@ ously to hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many list@@ eners are curious about their experiences as Greek Finance Minister at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I expected that .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back for the first six months after six months ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the euro@@ zone ,
not only Greece but the Eurozone ,
namely , to say goo@@ dbye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency and the perpet@@ ual den@@ ial that a massive re@@ valu@@ ation line was proce@@ eding through the euro@@ zone and continues to massi@@ vely thre@@ aten the development of the entire European Union .
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which , by the way , was the first proposal to reveal this den@@ ial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro area , within the European group , have still chosen den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you try to maintain an economic system that is not able to survive through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , you might be able to delay it for a while , but if the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destruc@@ tive .
BG : which changes do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its construction .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone looking back -- seri@@ ousness ...
if there is a finance minister , or any minister , who after 6 months in office , especially in such a stra@@ ined situation , claims he did not make any mistake , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for prolong@@ ing the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the don@@ or to find a common solution .
but that was not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they just wanted to bring our government , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that ran through the euro@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they did not want to admit that they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the Tro@@ ika of the len@@ ders who imposed this policy , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive action of the talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is facing someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
for if it does not survive , the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not have a cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to set the path of a post@@ modern 1930 , after which it seems to me , it will be as toler@@ able for the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for having been with TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
most have never heard of Roy Price , although he probably is responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy hit three years ago .
Roy Price is an editor at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel hair@@ style and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Techni@@ que , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for visiting the shows and the content that will produce Amazon .
of course , this is a very hard fought sector .
there are so many TV shows that Roy cannot select any one .
he must find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are right on this curve .
this curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the website IMDB . the rating is from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review is .
if your show is rated with nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where after one has looked at a season , your brain asks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Where is there any more of these epis@@ odes ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left hand side , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve .
Roy Price doesn &apos;t worry about getting on the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the average ex@@ ul@@ sion , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply do not delight .
so he must make sure he is really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time that Amazon does something , so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he keeps a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online , where they can watch everyone free of charge .
and if Amazon releases stuff for nothing , do you access right ?
millions of viewers watch these epis@@ odes .
however they do not know they are observed when watching these shows .
they are observed by Roy and his team who are recording everything .
you capture when you start the show when you pause , which parts you ski@@ p or check again .
they collect millions of data to determine which show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process this and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com about four Republi@@ can U.S. Sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7,@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
at the same time another manager has placed a top show with data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always searching to find a super show and he also uses data for it , but it makes it a little different .
instead of organizing a competition , he and his team have looked at the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they give the shows , their course , what shows they like etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : which shows they like , which producers , what actors .
when they had all the pieces together they went a car and decided not to make a Sit@@ com about four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; House of Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course , the question now is : what is happening here ?
you have two very competitive , data sealed companies .
they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic somehow states that it should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data for a decision you meet , you should make a good decision .
one has 200 years of statistics as Back @-@ Up .
it is optimized with very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis is not working , then this is a little fri@@ ghtening , because we live in a time when we take more and more to statistics , in order to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems here ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one ever comes into contact with this software in this space . come in touch , you are in prison .
if someone is in prison here in the US and asks for dismis@@ sal , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding if a show will be good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . that &apos;s not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems doesn &apos;t know how to use data .
even the data of the most experienced companies are sometimes wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that they can predi@@ ct out@@ breaks of flu , the bad way , through data analysis of Google &apos;s research .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it worked just fine , year by year , until it suddenly ceased to work ,
and no one could say why .
it simply did not work , this was another sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data flows into decisions of life -- at the workplace , in the enforcement of law , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded gene@@ tics -- an area where some very wise men use un@@ imagin@@ ably many data to make serious decisions on how the decision for a cancer therapy
over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be distributed .
if you have to solve a complex problem , do main two things :
first , put this problem into its components , so that you can analyse the items ; as a second , set the components together to create a resolution .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all possess it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces to put together again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert .
therefore , I believe Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have used data and understanding wherever they belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what otherwise they would not have been able to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts , put together a show like House of Cards , which was not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first as they were competing for TV ideas , then when they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just one tool , and in order not to forget that , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the tool for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; highly prob@@ able &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will challenge it later with a technical demo .
so far , I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have listened to the ball in hin@@ d@@ sight .
but , as you can of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it with a little more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
eventually it &apos;s up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data , it still pays off to make decisions , an expert in what to do and take risks .
at the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
