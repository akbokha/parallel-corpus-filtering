Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt , where young people should meet today .
a pit chapel , where now it is du@@ g for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
Klein@@ g@@ är@@ tner are cultiv@@ ating the former cause of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich is promoting exciting stories about days .
it anno@@ ys when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
that knows everyone who had to get up@@ set because the car @-@ navigation system showed a green me@@ adow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bayern of the State Government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but very informative .
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed since the 19th century in the area of the Munich Merk@@ ur area .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a fli@@ ck@@ ering carpet , which one does not recognize as such .
in the large picture postcard , detailed maps , so @-@ called ur@@ posi@@ tions@@ blätter , were incorporated for cities and municipalities .
these were created according to the Bay@@ erische Ver@@ mess@@ ungs@@ verwaltung between 18@@ 10 and 1864 .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army captain occupied Bavaria since spring 1800 during the Second Co@@ alition War in Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops finally with@@ drew with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville of February 9 , 18@@ 01 , there were today &apos;s neigh@@ bors who created the idea of a nation@@ wide Bavaria map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph drove the project further , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and therefore the Bay@@ erische Ver@@ mess@@ ungs@@ verwaltung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the collection for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like to find all the others on the website of the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek .
the comparison of early / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is sub@@ cut@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
Send@@ ling was founded 21 years after the card was created , so 1877 , as a district in Munich .
today , underground is located in the middle of the city .
the houses of Lower Saxony were concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after George Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 1878 , a leader of the u@@ prising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , you can see nothing but fields - at first sight : in the case of a zo@@ oming , a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand@@ written numbered plots from the so @-@ called &quot; original photograph , &quot; from which the basic tax was derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small plots today no longer prove to farmers - but small farmers of the plant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in Sonne &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Lower Saxony .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 scene of the Oktober@@ fest , was in fact a me@@ adow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ posi@@ tions@@ blatt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of today &apos;s district , Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen is not only reading the street name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Lüf@@ ten &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but also in big letters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here on the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one once locked people with mad@@ ness .
there in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Münchner Kreis @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; was created &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Ventil@@ ation . &quot;
from 18@@ 72 Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den headed up the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the chains of so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Irish &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he instruc@@ ted the staff to apply force against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , director of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients there was first room , later it was expanded to 500 places .
at some point , this capacity was not sufficient - the reason for the construction of the circular sir@@ ens in the year 1905 .
since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost is located , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts .
on the area of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt , young people now meet at the Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um in Munich .
the Order war@@ ped the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training facilities .
West is the football field of the T@@ SV München Ost , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was erected in an architectural approach to the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ strasse , which was destroyed during the Second World War in bom@@ bing ra@@ ids .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was built around 18@@ 56 as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main square &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the shopping road was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich too .
the bom@@ bs of the Al@@ lies broke out many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a big one remained until today - at Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a pit chapel from the Middle Ages were once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days were the prepar@@ atory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line .
with the sli@@ ders , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
civil rights group publish@@ es Rei@@ sew@@ ar@@ nung for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Promotion of Far@@ mers has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the Federal State Mis@@ sour@@ i , which will take effect until 28 August 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ amer@@ ican travellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to take special attention to travel through the state , as a number of question@@ able , r@@ acial @-@ based inci@@ dents occur throughout the country and are listed here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it difficult for people to win discrimination , as well as the prosec@@ uting authorities of the state who disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ately aim at minorities , the group called to issue the Rei@@ sew@@ n , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have violations of civil rights that people pass . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such inci@@ dence that we have not yet heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the US .
the group quoted inci@@ dents such as rac@@ ist crime against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ enn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died in question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no petrol during the trip and was taken in custo@@ dy by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of crime .
the Council also points to a recent report by the Mis@@ sour@@ i general public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in which black mot@@ orists will be held 75 percent more common than white .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be willing to accept deposits or let relatives know they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the hate crime report of F@@ BI , which classi@@ fies the state with regard to the number of such violations in the 16th position of the country .
the Rei@@ sew@@ ar@@ nung is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to su@@ e a company for housing or employment discrimination .
prior to that , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ LU ) issued rice prints for Texas and Arizona after the States adopted immigration laws to arrest people for immigration violations , which will contribute to further race @-@ profil@@ ing according to AC@@ LU &apos;s opinion .
travel sew@@ age is usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but recently interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fence project is elementary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Fisch@@ bacher Di@@ dez@@ au@@ n project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year .
the Bundestag Members of Parliament Peter Weiß and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have given a picture on site .
in the Leg@@ ion@@ enhof of the family Schwen@@ demann met representatives of the fishermen &apos;s bacher CD@@ U place together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties .
Markus Schwen@@ demann first granted insight into his farm in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and housed in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ milch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ demann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este is excluding region@@ ales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since he is also BL@@ HV Chairman of Fis@@ bach , he called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot be profitable on such steep areas .
the green area care for a lot of work , much need to be worked with the motor sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and with top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ demann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the farm and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ ser , even if he does not lead to bio @-@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e recognised the importance of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soft fence project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and is happy about the advancement of leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers need to be supported at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are .
I hope that the re@@ for@@ est@@ ation of the surfaces could be pulled out for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have are the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; farmers are often cri@@ tici@@ zed because of their support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were f@@ enced .
the open @-@ open area amounts to 40 hectares , which may not be for@@ ested until at least 2023 .
the total cost of EUR 71 500 was funded by half over the leader , a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fisch@@ bach .
thus the farmers had 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of electric fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Schwen@@ demann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and land@@ gins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter Weiß : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here are the best food produced &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scape Centre ( L@@ PR ) of Baden @-@ Württemberg enables state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art production of electric f@@ ences .
the aim is to maintain the Black Forest .
the prerequisite is the presence of a subsi@@ dy set by the L@@ PR .
in addition , the enclosure must not be tow@@ ed ( slope above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the re@@ for@@ est@@ ation .
the application of eight participants with 24 par@@ c@@ els , which would like to build fence nearly 16 kilometres of fence , is currently running for the Fis@@ her@@ bach &apos;s Wei@@ dez@@ aun@@ projekt 2018 .
the open @-@ up area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs lie at more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Sadd@@ am Hussein at the Fir@@ a square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N on the proposals of the president to dras@@ tically restri@@ ct the legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of bo@@ aters and liberty im@@ it@@ ators would have vo@@ iced him if he had done it .
but he attacked her meaning , and in particular the importance she was written as the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to his base .
as Miller A@@ co@@ sta compl@@ ained : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that en@@ ligh@@ tens the world .
the poem you refer to is later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is obj@@ ectively correct , but as he formulated it himself , it is not really about history .
it is about the cont@@ empor@@ aneous response to the vibr@@ ating words of Laz@@ arus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your tr@@ ash , your poor , / your aff@@ licted masses who long@@ ing to breathe freely , / the poor waste of your rich shores . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falling down &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on our screens was better to see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people were not welcome in the US .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural conflict : it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends , who used to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they did a highly political act .
the sculpture was to show the connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ anism , portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a portra@@ yed classical portra@@ yal .
Laz@@ arus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no more abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the connection between the poem and the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist cou@@ p and a devast@@ ating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Laz@@ arus changed the meaning of the statue , the people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time .
the great cry of R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed that the Statue of Liberty was not inviting anyone but rather an early neo @-@ conservative , bringing the American flame into the re@@ claimed world : &quot; Lady Liberty goes forward .
it should carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tor@@ ch should not en@@ ligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pretty unusual , Lim@@ bau@@ gh encountered something here .
the meaning of the statue is quite a matter of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Laz@@ arus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted , el@@ usive , but hop@@ eful people after long and often horri@@ ble journeys on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is in the most tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
and of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever want to acknowledge .
their tor@@ ch should not en@@ ligh@@ ten the way , but the hatred that is their only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scot@@ tish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle is remin@@ is@@ cent of a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the Team of Great Britain
&quot; &quot; &quot; the power director of the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scot@@ tish cont@@ ingent in the world championship k@@ ader &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scot@@ tish athletes was chosen for London 2017 that starts on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; developed in Scotland something special &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find it out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I talk to people in the Scot@@ tish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they did .
the Scot@@ tish athletes think it has something to do with what they did .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they did .
and also with the type at the corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several Scot@@ tish athletes , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart , are competing against Sir Mon Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected team captain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a series of athletes , whether they were Scot@@ tish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally brought in were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver med@@ al winner , who will compete in their fifth world champion@@ ships with the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the Middle @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir leads on this road and last year it took five British and two European records .
it will take part at the 1.500 m and the 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman worth watching after a great season that included the victory with the British Team Tri@@ als and Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle is remin@@ is@@ cent of her first World Championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell .
the team captain says that they are &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only a team , but in some cases also be mixed with the medals and at the Fin@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be special to the team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team@@ mates have voted for me and have chosen me , makes it something very special for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I &apos;m very proud of all the Sc@@ ots who belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it just shows how far we have come .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to go on stage .
what is my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , as we have a home world championship .
it is therefore really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be there a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
block cri@@ tic about Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you cannot toler@@ ate the sal@@ ary of vot@@ ers
the father of our country knew something from bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers struck him because of everything , from domestic politics to political principles .
he ple@@ aded with the criticism , safe .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stup@@ id and sil@@ ently we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Hog@@ an , who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union compl@@ ained about it at the beginning of this week .
the governor &apos;s staff dismis@@ sed the lam@@ entation as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a type like Hog@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state , which is surprisingly popular .
he has the second highest consent of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Hog@@ an is not a reactionary he@@ ath@@ ead .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict observ@@ ance of the principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as primary means to connect with his vot@@ ers and to de@@ bu@@ e his hair @-@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
that is why the block@@ ade of people coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum , is considered officially and by employees who are paid by public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans Amel@@ ia Ch@@ asse def@@ ended the Gover@@ nor &apos;s actions and argu@@ ed that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of cast@@ or or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ asser@@ ted people who swing online the whi@@ p .
the post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Hog@@ an .
and these are just real people speaking with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no role .
they all said that their comments were resp@@ ect@@ ful , thou@@ ght@@ ful and not prof@@ ane .
the past@@ or rec@@ ited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
attor@@ ney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ ated , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am cour@@ te@@ ous that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary box of the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea when a number of people take a position on the same topic , then they are considered by some rather than a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the govern@@ ors designated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call others &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to trim a message by simply blocking a cri@@ tic or del@@ eting a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in former times when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical cor@@ ps and to arrest and to silence the demonstr@@ ators .
but that &apos;s exactly what happened digit@@ ally .
Hog@@ an is not the first public official to cri@@ tici@@ ze that he has critic@@ ised Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump will be su@@ ed by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this issue fell last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County recorded the First Am@@ end@@ ment , according to U.S. District Jud@@ ges James C. Cach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when they appointed a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ LU due to his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so heavy .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable por@@ tos had a similar effect on the internet .
the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters of letters struck on his leadership .
and even then Washington had anonymous tro@@ ll@@ s .
the people who used p@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that settled Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions that cri@@ tici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Great Britain overwhel@@ med his position , according to historical documents collected by the online papers of George Washington Project .
but he did not silence her .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation .
and true guidance means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comforts in the Renaissance club
the former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hope to hope at home comforts in the next three days , as the Renaissance club in East Lo@@ th@@ ian will host the 25th edition of the Scot@@ tish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who was leading up to the final round in Ar@@ cher@@ field last year , before he lost Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the founder and CE@@ Os J@@ erry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great condition .
J@@ erry has done a great job when he set this place .
he is a ze@@ al@@ ous advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the British E@@ ales looks forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not been able to defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open since it was taken from the program in the year after I won them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
returning to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win here last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday this year , returns to his home ground .
this event will be its first Scot@@ tish performance since Aber@@ de@@ en Asset Management Scot@@ tish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a bit more when you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel that extra pressure .
I really enjoyed playing and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad how it has gone so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking
in the past two decades less people have died due to passive smoking of lung cancer .
scientists from the University Hospital of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases are attri@@ but@@ able to passive smoking rates per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Professor Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject in 1994 .
at that time , there have been 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking a year in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new study is published in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; International Journal of Public Health &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; &quot; &quot; construction work in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lie reasonably in time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the manager of the yard Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the area of house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is a lot of mountains in the underground , which is not mentioned in the plans .
the traffic , which constantly hin@@ ders construction work , represents a major problem for the construction up@@ p of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of drivers from red lights and barriers is already enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the buses are entitled to pass through .
Angelo Car@@ uso , Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were already exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but fortunately we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she does not use cook@@ er .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai reg@@ ent@@ ship in the in@@ quiet Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the hou@@ se@@ wife usually places a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour , the short@@ ened tu@@ bers are removed and dev@@ oured with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. clothes with cloudy water from the nearby sw@@ amp to wash .
a bu@@ cket in a hom@@ eless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of her husband &apos;s four wives , her no fields were assigned .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , too late to work can be dangerous : most village men are unemployed , and many are drinking hard , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one dar@@ es to run around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 after a controversi@@ al referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 elders were to vote by a public det@@ ention in front of the occup@@ ying forces .
an existing movement , stir@@ red up for independence from the Dutch domination , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal guar@@ di@@ ans from it .
in 2003 the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part Pap@@ ua New Guinea included the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is desert . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive by car .
there are no public means of transport .
the city with about 19,@@ 000 inhabitants is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bam@@ boo f@@ ences , and from corrug@@ ated roofs , which have been converted into different yellow tones by r@@ ust .
only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their trip here , let journalists and practically no aliens .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans wor@@ shipped a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright skirt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and have some of the worst inf@@ ant mort@@ ality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land provincial in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort was worth $ 3.1 billion gold and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has wood resources worth estimated 78 billion US dollars .
these riches , however , are a source of mis@@ ery for the Pap@@ ua that ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military keeps a sti@@ ck@@ ering presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid nearly 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004 , including up to $ 15@@ 0,000 in a single officer .
Pap@@ ua demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
more than 500@@ ,000 documents have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tort@@ ured and im@@ pris@@ oned by the Indonesian military since 1969 .
massac@@ res in Pap@@ ua &apos;s tri@@ bal state in the 1970 @-@ s were sentenced to genocide according to the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested over 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Will W@@ ing Every@@ thing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a report of the Arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Bris@@ ban@@ e from the year 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are contained , such as un@@ lawful exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric shock are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal supp@@ ression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week inci@@ dents happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bolts have increased , as Pap@@ ua &apos;s resources get an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic developments are changing because Muslim economic migrants come from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ aw@@ esi .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ p cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and g@@ ado g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce .
local people fight to keep up with this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the migrants started to sell ch@@ ick@@ ens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than local Pap@@ ua , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year old Pan@@ i@@ ai local , who moved to the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has tast@@ ed the native Pap@@ ua - Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - tast@@ ed her market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Pap@@ ua during his campaign in 2014 .
the former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua , little has changed , and today the locals feel che@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we have voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 with expec@@ tation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai was only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inaugur@@ ation a low point in October .
on December 7th , 2014 a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers jour@@ ne@@ yed on a motorcycle through the dark .
the fri@@ ghtened children told them they should turn on their spot@@ lights .
one of the soldiers participated in their sound and came back later with four soldiers , so the local past@@ or Y@@ av@@ ou T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had dr@@ unk , hun@@ ted and killed the group with their ri@@ bs , said to the victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
one child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so severely beaten that he fell into the coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered on a football field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Center to demand justice .
they wor@@ e cerem@@ onial ar@@ che@@ es and carried out the Wa@@ ita dance - continuously and a bird song im@@ it@@ ating - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago strain .
some demonstr@@ ators started to sling stones on police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses do more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official document of TIME that was not released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto neighborhood of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home .
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , suddenly I was shot into my left wrist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said TIME on the veranda of his colorful wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
kay@@ ak still doesn &apos;t know who has fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he adds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , who witnessed the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure that he was it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who , like many of Indonesia , bears only one name , the TIME in a dark mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de said rep@@ or@@ ters that his officers wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their station because they are attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner P@@ ud@@ jo Su@@ list , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings came on the following day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; by Jak@@ arta .
three weeks in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wor@@ e to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he obj@@ ected to an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the consideration of historical rights ab@@ uses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses almost immediately began .
&quot; most injuries occurred long ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations , but there are processes that need to pass through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke to TIME on June 5 , saying that he had no plans to establish a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Wir@@ anto , which the UN accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which demanded more than 1,000 death victims in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua were already settled , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with a fier@@ ce un@@ belie@@ ver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am tired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he says he is still living in fear years later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried my dead , the military sought me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday , the Indonesian police fired on vill@@ agers in the neighbourhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confront@@ ation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , who refused to go to hospital a un@@ conscious man , a person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year old R@@ avi@@ anus dou@@ w , who was dro@@ w@@ ned when he conf@@ essed in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
armed vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s sit@@ ing office .
the police said that the vill@@ agers war@@ n stones on officers who responded by fir@@ ing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indonesian par@@ am@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we fear that there will be ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu B@@ adi@@ i , who lives and witnessed in the vicinity of the hospital and witnessed how the wounded have been delivered here quickly , such as TIME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to account for the officers involved and withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade of the police from the territory . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a flash@@ point for the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the tri@@ bal members of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( OP@@ M ) , the re@@ bel army , claiming to defend the rights of Pap@@ ua by cont@@ ending spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kid@@ n@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top @-@ OP@@ M leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ den Kog@@ o@@ ya .
in response to this in recent years , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbit@@ rar@@ ily taken in custo@@ dy under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people of Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a trag@@ ic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ content .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of range .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes each .
they keep the bulk of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
in the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the indigenous Pap@@ ua and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes to the Nab@@ ire Airport .
the few work@@ places that exist in the region generally go to the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to make their own enterprises competitive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , chair of the tri@@ bal council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
moreover , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Basi@@ lle Long@@ champ were deport@@ ed due to lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission to film was given to them .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ INE , the dep@@ uty Asia @-@ Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development are not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s rest@@ less eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa ref@@ usal and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confin@@ ed to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ ua .
in March six p@@ aci@@ fic States - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ in@@ seln and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sho@@ oting .
the same countries have historically watched the OP@@ M .
the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r pointed out the accus@@ ations of the Group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia is still a democratic system , and there are free media , making it difficult to cover the evidence of human rights fail@@ ures . &quot;
people on the spot want more foreign governments to take note of this .
as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of Human Rights Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura visited her silence and pressed him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua predi@@ cts that they will probably not be voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i again .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tri@@ bal .
he wants Jok@@ ow@@ i know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is located in poor educational and health services .
Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; gu@@ ilt &quot; which he has to pay back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need any money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the threats and in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ shot sacrifice made a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the body of an victim was buried on a site exactly opposite the police and the military station .
they know that they may never come to justice , but at least they will not forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us says with her head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what else can we do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fire records the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scrap@@ er from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the world &apos;s highest residential towers in Dubai its audi@@ ob@@ ook and forced hundreds of inhabitants to escape from the 337 metres high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that is swe@@ pt through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which is acci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up at the fire@@ arm and the scre@@ aming of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; an inhabit@@ ant told his name as George , Reu@@ ters .
Dubai &apos;s civil defence authorities said that fire fighting units at 4.00 pm local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) cleared the fire and cooled down the building .
the government said they work on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rises all over the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its inc@@ iner@@ ation in 2015 revealed that most of the damages of the cover , the outer cover for decoration or insulation , came .
in Britain , the police said that the system of plates for insulation and facing at the London Gren@@ fell tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in June , with about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : more Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through its large Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the idea for this sport was to play a revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup sing@@ les only on two stak@@ es , thin @-@ thin not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
although often very long , but even therefore very estimated five @-@ pack classics are preserved in the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of the member countries voted for reform , the goal of IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore scar@@ c@@ ely missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our member@@ ships did not accept the complete reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change in order to ensure the long @-@ term future of these icon@@ ic and historic competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one will continue to work on improving the application .
not only for the vote , after many contradictions , the proposal had already come to pro@@ claim the finale at a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively small details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be the host @-@ right in the first round in the following year .

a pol@@ l under flight passengers found that more than 20 per cent conscious or un@@ consciously forbidden items are sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while wearing them acci@@ dentally forbidden knife or other objects with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed they had been bel@@ ated that they were mistakenly powered with fire@@ arms , amm@@ unition , or explo@@ sives .
the survey for more than 1,000 people - which was conducted by a jet charter service , Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also stated that younger travellers rather dis@@ regard the rules .
the respon@@ dents who admitted they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was b@@ anned by the T@@ SA were 19.@@ 7 percent Mill@@ enni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent who were members of the X generation .
the most common items reported to T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent reported to have carried away items with blades carried by security control , while 2.2 per cent of female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male inter@@ view@@ ees also confirmed that they had deliberately brought b@@ anned drugs into the aircraft .
the company said it asked travelers across the country to find out how many in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently brought sm@@ ug@@ gling goods by airport security and how many did it inten@@ tionally .
it is no surprise that people who are most sm@@ ug@@ ly - know@@ ingly or unk@@ now@@ ingly - carry on safety , those who fly most often .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complex and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure what liquids they are allowed to take or how much of it .
it is therefore no surprise that the largest amount of liquids conf@@ is@@ cated by the T@@ SA are prohibited liquids .
for a while people thought that T@@ SA could look at books as sm@@ ug@@ gling goods .
liquids are allowed on inland flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
&quot; &quot; &quot; Electr@@ o @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k is pleased to have a huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , he has so far under@@ gone that a part of the customers has already with@@ drawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the ever tri@@ umph@@ ant figures for increased sales and even more massive sales targets , Tes@@ la @-@ CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k will reveal a different , less @-@ gloss number for the first time at the announcement of the latest quar@@ terly report : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k frequently had more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery just begins .
now Mus@@ k adm@@ its : from the total 5@@ 18,@@ 000 pre @-@ orders , 63@@ .000 had already been with@@ drawn .
critics repeatedly pointed out that it is merely a non @-@ binding booking .
in case of cancellation Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the U.S. $ 1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment . &quot;
at present , 45@@ 5,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations en@@ su@@ ed , Mus@@ k admitted in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders may become a problem .
its argument : the challenge for the ambitious growth targets is not on demand , but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la delivered 84@@ .000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2018 , it is said that all models will be combined - 500@@ ,000 , 2020 a million . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , there are 1800 bookings per day .
whoever orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; is expected to be delivered early in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new , never in practice tested production lines without any major dis@@ rup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if it comes to bigger delays , then the liability of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company can &apos;t prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running away in pairs .
EPA CEO P@@ ru@@ itt with@@ draws on emissions reduction due to the down@@ fall of the Obama Er@@ a rules
one day after he had been accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the chief of the Environmental Protection Authority , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce the emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air poll@@ ut@@ ants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes as his agency proved to be respon@@ sive to the needs of state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint that was raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of App@@ eal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about a period that ran out on October 1 for states to comply with the standards of 2015 for ground @-@ near o@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt reported in June that he would delay the observ@@ ance of a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interfer@@ ing in local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump Public Prosec@@ utor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental protection regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly committed to blocking or del@@ aying regulation to which the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels oppose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sudden revers@@ al from Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the withdrawal of regulatory roll@@ back agenda . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month , a Federal Court of App@@ eal in Washington ruled that the EPA car@@ et@@ aker exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce meth@@ anol .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his turn @-@ around in o@@ zone standards simply rein@@ forces the willingness of EPA to cooperate with States through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in previous administr@@ ations the EPA has often failed to observe the dead@@ lines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement to set the deadline for carrying out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation through legal proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority which gives us serious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the statement of EPA said that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; em@@ power@@ ment to delay and all other legally available authority &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a broader new constitution of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill of law approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the measure has not yet been set up in the Senate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the New York state attor@@ ney , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of states who had lam@@ ented the EPA this week , said the group intends to maintain the legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important profit for health and security of these 6,@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by smo@@ g who flows into their congregations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said tail@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this case New York joined San Francisco , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massach@@ us@@ etts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , O@@ reg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ien , Rho@@ de Island , Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
ground @-@ o@@ zone is created when poll@@ ut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year contributing to thousands of premature deaths .
representatives of public health care and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered over punishment surprising course changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is distur@@ bing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step by the responsible for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological cross@@ roads of the Tr@@ ump government to turn to environmental cont@@ amin@@ ers and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ bling celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , on the old cemetery @-@ area in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , 16th July , at 4.@@ 30 pm a ser@@ en@@ ade was invited .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius @-@ site is a popular place to stay .
the visitors of the sixth benefit ser@@ en@@ ade can be ench@@ anted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and supporters of Tum@@ ours to their concerns .
Walter Martini emphas@@ ises : &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in documents in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischen Ur@@ kunden@@ buch : Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church of Tum@@ lingen and the Vog@@ tei &quot; to Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the document , on the Tum@@ linger Mountain , apart from the former parish church , there was also a delightful court to which the Church or the pat@@ ron@@ age was right and not the other way round .
so people also lived there .
as described in the description of the Upper Freuden@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , was next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which today is still recogni@@ zable in the town@@ scape of Tum@@ bling , the &quot; Berg &quot; the third , the splendid settlement nucle@@ us of the village .
old maps dating back to the year 1600 under@@ pin these historical circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pat@@ ron@@ age &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was born from the early medieval church right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a Lord who built a church and occupied with a past@@ or remained the owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this church .
associated with this was the right to use a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Gre@@ ater of the two sh@@ attered at Christmas in 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over later during the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were inserted and the bell pep@@ pers were stolen .
the roof was waterproof .
in 17@@ 96 French troops camp@@ ed near the church .
they turned out the pul@@ pit and ch@@ urch@@ yard chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church threatened to crash in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 , the Hil@@ arius cemetery served as last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche abandoned .
only the church tower was left .
in the New Year &apos;s eight in 18@@ 34 , a storm out@@ divided the church tower and the half crashed .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demoli@@ shed .
only the tower remaining today was preserved as a witness of the 750 years old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter W@@ as@@ em are cultiv@@ ating the &quot; creative reti@@ re@@ es &quot; as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
as organis@@ er , the friends and promot@@ ers invite the tum@@ ul@@ gens on Sunday , July 16th , to the sixth ser@@ en@@ ade to the old cemetery of St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
it is designed by the com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freuden@@ stadt and with words by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Reinhold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
Hart@@ mut RO@@ MANN says the closing word .
the program will start at 4 : 30 p.m .
admission is from 3.30 pm .
to the end of the ser@@ en@@ ade a trunk is held in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organizers put out the fantastic view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ser@@ en@@ ade occurs only in dry weather .
the organizers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius @-@ plant , which is of importance for tum@@ bling and hearing welding .
friends and promot@@ ers are particularly committed to their home care , such as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Martini .
association wants to test approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim we@@ aves itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sees no legal pre@@ condition for construction and has therefore turned to the country council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim we@@ aves itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has called upon Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take back his permit for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved because at the time in Vier@@ sen only at the city border to Schwal@@ m@@ tal existed a wind power concentration zone .
within this concentration zone construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such zones should prevent a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saving &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few days earlier , the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette a few days earlier - but the district government Düsseldorf was not approved because of a defect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning for planning , the granted approval is still un@@ lawful and therefore with@@ drawn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , president of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim we@@ aves itself &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current state of affairs : the city coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or once again decided upon the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette before the summer break ; a approval by the district government is still intact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is where the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is legally excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding writings have been received by the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle becomes the occasion to re @-@ examine the matter again .
however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself in terms of the argument of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim we@@ aves itself &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four each 200 metres high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
already last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen contributed indirectly , lease agreements with the owner of about 65 hectares large off @-@ site .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , electricity needs to be covered by around 11 400 households - this corresponds to roughly one fifth of the electricity requirement of all four @-@ grain households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sen &apos;s City Council provided green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch Wind@@ park near Aachen as well as a stake in a wind energy plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in County of Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor crashed together : woman dies in terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident happened on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was mort@@ ally wounded .
two more people were easily injured .
the state road remained blocked for hours .

city and dealer plan &quot; Heimat @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; -@@ Week@@ end
in September , Bad Langen@@ sal@@ aer and people from the region are to be re@@ discovered in the city centre .
the commercial club and the municipal administration want to take advantage of the weekend on 8 and 9 September to l@@ ure the inhabitants of shopping in the city centre .
as the chairman of the trade association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; Heimat @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; weekend is meant to sensi@@ ti@@ ze the customers , which offers their own city apart from the usual supermarket goods .
the plan is therefore a market with regional suppliers , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , local firms are to present themselves with their apprentic@@ eship places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre are to invite you to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the nearby region .
in preparation are commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend , so Christian König .
the Municipal Auth@@ orities and the Trade Union cooperate with the Chamber of Industry and Industry .
thus the commercial club and the city go to another stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive inner city . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes new offers , such as the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Active Day &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; for well @-@ selling Sunday , talks with all business owners and hosts to move them to active participation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potential is to be re@@ opened or re@@ opened again .
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city center while shopping .
in the end everyone would have to contribute to revi@@ ving the city centre - to land@@ lords , businesses of the whole city and clubs .
it was time to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which partly spread , had said in the spring .
Birgit St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Mühl@@ hausen agreed that the third &quot; Heimat @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; tag , for the first time , took part in five Thuring@@ ian cities .
in addition to Bad Langen@@ sal@@ za these are Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ er@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote the appreciation of local trade and raise its importance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the action led by the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his immediate surroundings with his purchasing behaviour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two dead and several injured after explosion at U.S. school
during construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building .
new more people were injured .
in a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis , two people were killed and nine more injured , some of them heavy .
according to the fire department , on Wednesday ( local time ) there was still an injury in critical condition .
a person died when a part of a school building collap@@ sed during the explosion .
a first missing was later also lost dead .
the dead were employees of the school .
as an accident , the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline .
during the holiday season there were only a few people in the building of the Minn@@ eh@@ aha Academy .
Tr@@ ump put pressure on calls Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scription of phone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leader of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January Tr@@ ump called for a telephone conversation with Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to say publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US President ple@@ aded him because he had publicly den@@ ounced the wall . report@@ edly , he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You cannot tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA , and sw@@ or to pay Mexico for the project .
tran@@ scrip@@ tions of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia are &quot; ridi@@ cul@@ ous , &quot; &quot; bad , &quot; and &quot; stup@@ id , &quot; and that the existence of the trade that was im@@ par@@ ted by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; dep@@ p &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford @-@ Mass@@ aker : activists run rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ akt as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in the Monroe County , Georgia , and rum@@ ored to the Ford @-@ Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle aged man in a needle strip suit - took a long train on his c@@ ig@@ ar and looked through the wind@@ shield .
inside the in@@ mates were ho@@ ver@@ ing in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ am torn the silence , when a young black man was drag@@ ged by the passenger seat .
luck@@ ily this horri@@ ble scene , which was played on July 22nd , is only a post@@ p@@ one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost everyone in the audience looks very real si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , civil rights activists from Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge come back to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were gel@@ ding by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever charged with murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really incredible that in all these years , no single person was arrested - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks who helps with the organisation of post @-@ creation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a stain on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former member of the Con@@ gres@@ sman of Georgia and a lifetime of civil rights activists .
for him , the post @-@ position serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual remembrance of the Monroe community that a injus@@ tice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to prosec@@ ute , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must receive justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot come to healing and reconciliation , until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a cour@@ t@@ eller puts a blank@@ et on the cor@@ p@@ ses of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
according to F@@ BI files received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding communities were suspected in the ly@@ n@@ ching process .
but none was ever accused .
although the susp@@ ects remain un@@ affected for decades , citizens &quot; rights say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice allowed the black citizens to vote their vote in Georgia for the first time in the summer .
approximately at the same time as the choice st@@ aches according to information of the F@@ BI the black bull @-@ keeper Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our in the city was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she carried she did not stem from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to liber@@ ate Mal@@ com from prison , so the F@@ BI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and their cou@@ sins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when they approached the prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who has prepared and arranged the mur@@ ders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conclu@@ des an F@@ BI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspir@@ acy between national and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , evi@@ den@@ ced evi@@ dences and evi@@ den@@ ced the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks form@@ ulates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an elec@@ toral law massac@@ re , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , this will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for nearly a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual production of Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is vi@@ vi@@ dly , gri@@ pping and is based in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , of which many would like to believe that he does not exist in America any more .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and even more difficult to look at , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about Lyn@@ ch because we are confronted with his ug@@ liness in us all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or want to hear what I have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen White and the rest Black - pushed into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ coordinated overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director .
he has played the role of the chief cl@@ an member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not that way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of space the actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the high priest cri@@ es out and pushed him angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wor@@ shipped my property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ ak resist@@ s the fire .
there is a pause .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out into laughter .
gre@@ ene laugh@@ s at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what ? ! , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ cona . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gre@@ ene said , still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I simply don &apos;t think white people back then &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wit@@ ched one of the other black actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and precisely there the energy shifts in space , a feeling of cam@@ ar@@ ader@@ ie replaces the dis@@ comfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game , but also because of memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ word , he says it sharp@@ ly and with im@@ print .
absolutely no one laugh@@ s .
this re@@ petition ends violent and fast .
there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
a woman clo@@ thed with a sorrow , stands above the bodies of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays sad song &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
your voice breaks in every second word .
about a hundred meters behind , a group of about four dozen people caught sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost uni@@ form@@ ly divided between black and white .
a couple is coming from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down only the street .
they have experienced Georgi@@ an op@@ pres@@ sive moisture for nearly eight hours when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you are standing on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch mur@@ ders took place , the air feels g@@ onna .
when the last notes of the song sound out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the Lei@@ ch@@ name .
children ho@@ ck at their heads , register the f@@ ake blood and the breast@@ feeding body and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mur@@ m@@ urs a little boy as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , Gre@@ ene would like to thank the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch@@ rope and wi@@ pe their tears away .
Brad@@ sha@@ w embr@@ aces Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit that the cl@@ an member has played .
Nick Ras@@ cona bit@@ es two of his fellow players and then breaks down in her arms , the emotional load of the performance eventually breaks through him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have done that for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience sat together with the actors for dinner .
at a table a white couple from Atlanta ch@@ okes about the reproduction with a black couple that they have just got to know .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words which feel the performance left behind .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these horri@@ ble words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and do that because they look like you , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what really is doing with me makes me believe that Lyn@@ chen is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Today it is called police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone holds Broo@@ ks &apos;s court at his table , he e@@ ats and rec@@ alls the civil rights .
he said he already started planning the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reproduction is in a certain way inspiring because it describes the hor@@ ror of what we have endu@@ red but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so if we don &apos;t learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ äm@@ merung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ reuth

great appl@@ ause is for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in casual leisure clothing .
the show was eag@@ erly awa@@ ited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of Regi@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; had he had to leave a g@@ ell@@ ar whi@@ stle concert in 2013 , there were five years later great rejo@@ icing in which the occasional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bu@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls went down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner hopes to be happy about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you notice that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it is also an understanding of its view .
I draw a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
max quantity works as a volunteer
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
quantity : normally in Stein@@ furt in the Fur@@ niture Fair , once a week I help here in Greven in the furniture bridge .
and I have already worked at school in an open whole day .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it &apos;s a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with teen@@ agers , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years old , so a late @-@ time volunteer .
how does that come ?
quantity : I made Ab@@ it@@ ur .
and then a civil engineering degree , let &apos;s say , successfully ab@@ orted .
I recognized for me that it is the wrong for me and I want to do something else to work with people .
and then I asked myself what you are doing .
do a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , at the focal point , perhaps , really .
and was it so ?
crowd : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in social sciences in the winter semester .
I will study dual , probably make a social worker training and study in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hochschule in Jugen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne .
is it not unusual to have several different purposes during the volunteer service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends where you make your FS@@ J .
it is possible to make it from the retirement home to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partially in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me it was exactly the right thing that appe@@ aled to me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
different than in civil engineering ?
quantity : well clear , here it is not about calcul@@ ating st@@ atics .
one always has other people &apos;s head , each of which has a completely different story behind them .
whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager has been taken out of the family - you always have to pay attention to it .
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
crowd : for this I am not the type .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , great kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is just like that .
Pear@@ son short@@ ens additional 3,000 jobs and short@@ ens the divi@@ dend to revi@@ ve the business
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UK education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , it will reduce additional 3,000 jobs and cut its divi@@ dend by 72 percent as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure that the company faces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to its previous restructuring , the Secretary General John Fall@@ on announced , in addition to his previous restructuring , at which 4,000 jobs were already lost .
Pear@@ son announced a third cost reduction plan in May in a third cost reduction programme to revi@@ ve another 300 million pounds ( 394 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the rapid pace of digital learning .
the company , which has sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the Ber@@ tel@@ smann partner last month , said the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after achieving an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kab@@ ul Kon@@ vo@@ i attack : NATO soldier killed on self @-@ murder attack
a su@@ icide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ vo@@ y in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a soldier of NATO and injured several others , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter were injured and shared an explanation of NATO .
according to local reports , three civilians died in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district .
the bom@@ bing is the last violent act that Afghanistan has taken this month - on Tuesday , more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at .
on Monday , a su@@ icide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi emb@@ assy in Kab@@ ul .
in a statement by NATO , the explosion on Thursday evening was to happen when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by an impro@@ vised explo@@ sives by persons . &quot;
the statement states that all the wounded are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital on the Bag@@ ram air@@ field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Tali@@ ban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , a su@@ icide auto@@ graph killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Tali@@ ban said they had done this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bom@@ bing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the most deadly milit@@ ant attack of the country , since the US @-@ led troops pushed the Tali@@ ban from power in 2001 .
the force under@@ lines the prec@@ ari@@ ous security situation in Afghanistan because U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops to support the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that in recent weeks the su@@ icide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policies and especially in the reputation of President As@@ hr@@ af Gh@@ ani .
EPA returns decision to delay the smo@@ g rule by law@@ suits
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay Obama &apos;s government regulation , repe@@ aling that the states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this occurred a day after 15 States def@@ ended the agency because of the stri@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced its decision late on Wednesday to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oz@@ on@@ stances 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said they are showing the Agency &apos;s commitment to collabor@@ ate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue and that we respond to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA CEO Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA in June , the o@@ zone regulations - in which poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions are to be measured in a part of the country to determine where incis@@ ions have to be made to delay stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year until October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the Colombia district , filed suit on Tuesday and said the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has attempted to return a wide range of environmental conditions imposed by former President Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda that is to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have spar@@ ked the impact of democr@@ ats and nature conservation groups who are worried about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EP@@ O &apos;s website says that inhal@@ ing air , which contains o@@ zone , can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms , such as as@@ thma .
community wants community space
in the end , the decision was clear : with two opposing votes , the municipal council of Flu@@ spur @-@ Win@@ zeln decides to establish a common room in the future retirement home .
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the missing property part is signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
while the area is still owned by the church community , it will still take a long time , but there is no planning for the project to be carried out by a private investor .
there is a discussion about a shared space .
one of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space of approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with an area of 70 square meters for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council are pret@@ ending to have such a common space not as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ tion@@ able living , but open to the congregation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision made by the provision of funds for the current household has already been decided last autumn by means of funding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the construction is in the rehabilitation area .
the establishment of a common room would be , as reported by T@@ j@@ aden , condu@@ ci@@ ve to 60 percent of 30 percent .
the proposal is to signal the investor that in this respect no Kn@@ ü@@ ppel intends to throw between the legs , the statement that both sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ers - which have been le@@ aning against the surrounding environment - as well as the pitch roof - would be possible and the construction cost more economical .
need@@ less to say , it is not just Wilfried S@@ oh@@ mer , be this addi@@ tive .
when it helps : un@@ anim@@ ously he passes the body .
it &apos;s not that easy for the common room .
Daniela &apos;s call points to the many of his own buildings , with whom you don &apos;t get so well , you sit down now in the community space out of the window , she says , &quot; I am very hard with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger necessarily speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal involvement .
it sees behind it a conce@@ aled subsi@@ dy to any already weal@@ thy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the area one does not grant a subsi@@ dy , but will get a real , in case of doubt commerci@@ ally available , is the counter @-@ speech .
Sta@@ ig@@ er &apos;s proposal to raise the proposal according to the proposal , finds three pro@@ ponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two contra@@ sts in the original program that Stefan H@@ aller summar@@ izes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we believe the decision , we make a huge step in closing a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
colli@@ sion with car : Rad@@ ler sh@@ ines on the road
crossing the road a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycli@@ st was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath and was severely injured .
as the police took part , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Langen@@ felder was on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer trail coming from Hil@@ den on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer .
the Senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .

FC Bayern Munich must ren@@ ounce David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago at the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba needs to su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
with human resources , the FC Bayern will be the first mandatory match for the new season to Dortmund .
seven professionals are missing the title def@@ ender in the Super@@ cup against the cup winner .
the staff at the German football record champion Bayern Munich are getting bigger in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 pm / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must ren@@ ounce David Al@@ aba in du@@ el with the B@@ VB .
this confirmed the Italian on Friday .
in addition , the ch@@ ick@@ ens Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six years , An@@ cel@@ otti has been responsible for the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the last thing was not good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory match of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans in their spell .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , distributed the German Soccer League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday .
in the resin from star to star hiking
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the resin the country &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is planned by the Verein Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
a planet &apos;s path exists in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; met the need for information of many Har@@ z@@ besu@@ cher , it was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
members want to place boards along the planned route and inform them about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase up to 2018 , the association plans to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
In@@ quiry kä@@ se St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß und Si@@ eber .
the information on the boards should be supplemented by internet .
therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of the site .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later the Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad Zug is to be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star path , the viewers experience a lot of interesting facts , such as the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they also learned why stars would have different colors or why a star is more light than another , although it is much further away .
also , in which con@@ stellation you find a selected star and when it is best to see .
since 2014 the association operates the highest observ@@ atory in northern Germany in the St. Andre@@ as@@ berg mountain village .
according to the Federal Office for Nature Con@@ servation , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there , the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y are visible clearly with the naked eye .
since 2003 , in the Uni @-@ Stadt there has been something similar to the Plan@@ etary path since 2003 on the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Göttingen .
beginning in front of Geb@@ har@@ ds hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet path leads up to the Hain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an extr@@ ater@@ restrial facility in Di@@ em@@ arden ( community ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ es with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to D@@ warf Plan@@ ets at the end point - are positioned exactly in the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks so on a ball of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the sun at exactly 75 meters measures 70 centimet@@ res .
the entire distance of the planet path is about four kilometres .
while the light from sun goes up to the Plu@@ to approximately eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are thus faster than the light in the cos@@ mos .
the march to the next fixed star would still last a half year .
Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and V@@ asy@@ l Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
V@@ asy@@ l Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a colli@@ sion course in order to stage the most exciting fight in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN office in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ disp@@ uted World Box@@ ing Council lightweight champion , the cor@@ ridor went down to gre@@ et Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Box@@ ing Organisation Super @-@ Spring Champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s win by un@@ anim@@ ous decision on the former four divisions world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out the right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it to you , champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you a lot of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect size . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rec@@ alled Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I grew up for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to come down to light weight .
and he has to move on weight weigh@@ ers &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that demand the fans .
let &apos;s give them that . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko voted &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
Klim@@ as asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko has to fight with a 135 pound lot this year to agree on a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell according to their weight @-@ weight title fight in the Forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans had asked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said and later expressed openly to fight on the network that offers the best finance package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he supplements Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous figh@@ ter , &quot; and he may possibly take part in his Saturday fight .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko continued with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said he think the three @-@ fight champion from River@@ side sees &quot; very slowly , sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted the co @-@ off . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show impact , then boxes .
both said they could sense the momentum that was built for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the fight which must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; Gar@@ cia said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Lom@@ ach@@ enko , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been waiting for the top figh@@ ter , and that is Mik@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injured after tire @-@ place
in the case of an accident on the A7 , four people were severely injured in the afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost control of his vehicle shortly before the junction of the market shortly before the junction .
the car drag@@ ged to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he sur@@ passed and then remained on the roof in the green stri@@ pe .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured during the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the ambul@@ ance service the A7 was locked in the north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident .
Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; triple chain works better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the 2 : 2 Andre Hoffmann hopes for the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig that optim@@ ising the def@@ ensive formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first match of the season Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , even though there were not the two opponents at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much and we have to look better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the defense player of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the triangle chain is also to be further optimised .
and a door@@ way after a colli@@ sion , the lag@@ o@@ ons don &apos;t want to catch anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , it will be that no one will stand alongside Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his team will also get better after the experience in preparation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; triple @-@ chain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than with the four @-@ chain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have just in the triple @-@ chain on the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Nik@@ o G@@ ieß@@ elmann constructed players who can build well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prerequisite is , but that we are even better harmon@@ izing and we do not make so many play mistakes in the construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann also drives to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can speak after an accident of a failed start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we d@@ rank with four points on Sunday and focus on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a decent season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer wanted to know nothing about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start into the season I judge only after six to eight playing days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be canc@@ eled ahead of a storm . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann believe that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit more fresh as they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against an as@@ cen@@ sion in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they do not know 100 percent where they are at present , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the inner def@@ ender of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although guests from the Rhin@@ eland go a light favourite on Sunday into the meeting at last ( almost ) finished st@@ adion of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we swe@@ ep them away , just because we have the right to go under the first six is non@@ sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el , whose balance sheet is quite positive in only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which needs to be beaten from the outs@@ et , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Fort@@ unas senior coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meeting such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so Funk@@ el wants to experience his players in no case on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ age evaluation test published
the recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , who have under@@ gone a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for for@@ ensi@@ c medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has started conducting the tests last year .
they should make the assessment of the age more precise during the asylum procedure after the Swedish migration agency ( migration disgu@@ ised ) has been cri@@ tici@@ zed for errors in assess@@ ing the correct age of some refugees who were under@@ age .
up to now , Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6.@@ 880 to test cases and the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 481 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , whereas in further 25 cases the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 432 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be less than 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is ques@@ tioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency , the results have been stable over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are pretty constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases where the person was assessed as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers have lied about his age .
in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 442 cases that &quot; suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska Dag@@ bla@@ det investigated the 5@@ 81 published results , she stated that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she was 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , where x @-@ ray images of wisdom teeth and M@@ RI images of knee joints are made , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been cri@@ tici@@ zed in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ inska Institute , whose work involves assess@@ ing the biological ri@@ pen@@ ess of people to see if they were used sooner or later than usually by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
jud@@ ging the biological age in this way is very un@@ certain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we can &apos;t say it safe , we should not pret@@ end if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency def@@ ended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of having a child as an adult is negli@@ gible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in the Plan
the work on the three bridges of Land@@ strasse 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg is progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday a seven tons of heavy concrete was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it works great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reinhold Lei@@ cht , director at the department of road and traffic in the government @-@ pres@@ idency of Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the works began at the same time on all three re@@ constructions ne@@ ural bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is scheduled for October and is sure that the schedule is maintained .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ aul@@ ted arch bridge made of concrete , lined with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabil@@ it@@ ated .
the two other bridges lead over Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday morning on the north side has a 1.30 m wide and seven ton heavy so @-@ called bridge cap .
this is a random fix@@ ation , which is also used as an operating path .
on the southern part of the bridge a 2.20 m wide bridge cap should be used on Friday .
then the pedestrian wal@@ k@@ way is to pass .
the special thing is that it is manufacturing parts , a patent from the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
special finger@@ tip emp@@ t@@ iness required the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable connected to which many companies are connected .
prior to the work , the residents were informed about the project .
in addition , fish and cru@@ st@@ ace@@ ans had to be caught .
for the bridges between the building yard and the collective wei@@ her in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg the traffic is regulated one @-@ lane by a traffic light .
the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Si@@ eben Lin@@ den &quot; is completely blocked for construction work on the bridge at Lau@@ ter@@ bach Valley .
the cost of the three bridge structures is 700 000 euros .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ unter Prot@@ est with German potato salad
it is not so common that parties pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to reconc@@ ile .
the parties represented by Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows peaceful flags on this day , because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle R@@ ond@@ ell invites for a poster &quot; Great campaign start . &quot;
and well known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top duo for the German Bundestag election on September 24 , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix von Stor@@ ch .
but those who are there already hours before the start of the event don &apos;t want to listen to Af@@ D players , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
originally the city picnic under the slogan &quot; All at a table &quot; on the well ground is planned , but now takes place on the parking below the R@@ ond@@ elles - and thus right in front of the eyes of those coming to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle .
a colorful picture that offers itself .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair of the Forums A world and one of the author@@ it@@ ative organis@@ ers , really rejo@@ iced : &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and lots of food , including an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; original potato salad , which the Af@@ D could eat without any problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police have ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein because it shows presence in particular also at the station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .
how did Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reported from Af@@ D Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel , he took care of such an event and got the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ners@@ dorf initially asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because due to the built @-@ in Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us kir@@ mes there was not enough parking space available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so now the R@@ ond@@ elle , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; looking at the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also does : at 20.00 on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz square there is a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle diverse speakers , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D chairman Uwe Junge .
in the hall there are about 200 list@@ eners who wait for the top candidate for the German Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix von Stor@@ ch .
the police station remained unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
something more than an hour takes the Af@@ D event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is a short time after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can remove - no special inci@@ dents .
tromb@@ one meets trumpet
a re@@ play with the Wolf@@ ach Pos@@ a@@ ists Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ konz@@ erte morgen , Sunday , at 8 pm in the Klo@@ st@@ erk@@ irche .
together with the Bulgarian trumpet Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Schwarz@@ meer meets in Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ fol@@ klore &quot; meets a classical German training with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
so Pet@@ kov is solo trumpet at the renowned Con@@ cert@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the solo concert of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the desire to not only transc@@ end the borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different gen@@ res .
in this way , Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new garment , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &apos;s world music , together with Bulgarian fol@@ klore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the Jazz@@ ech@@ op@@ rei@@ str@@ ä@@ gers N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free play blend into a fascinating Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk .
this part of the program was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Klo@@ st@@ erk@@ irche with her special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Stew@@ art talks about her bis@@ ex@@ ual
&quot; some people love gr@@ illed che@@ eses and will eat it until the end of their lives .
but I want to try everything , &quot; explains Kri@@ sten Stew@@ art openly about her bis@@ ex@@ ual .
&quot; when I bite into gr@@ illed cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; .
the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was the &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; counter@@ part Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately dealt bitter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the brun@@ ette act@@ ress insured against the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been seriously fallen in love I have taken . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I &apos;d have played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her separation , Kri@@ sten found that she is bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I have always lived du@@ alism and believed it seriously .
so it has never been confused or ob@@ struc@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have never liked it to be taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , she suffered from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ biz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but at school time when she pre@@ fers to dress like a boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this really hurt me very much .
when I was eleven told me the children , I would look like a bu@@ b .
I felt really attacked , scar@@ ed and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girls , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the public don &apos;t like to explain their love life : &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me to be un@@ grateful , but I don &apos;t like to justify me from the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the governor of West Virginia termin@@ ates that he changes the party
the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced a manifestation with President Tr@@ ump on Thursday evening that he will change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and much reflection ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; as a trainer , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump had previously announced a great announcement at the West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate Hill@@ ary Clinton .
Justice , who is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state according to For@@ bes , was elected 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he owns coal mines in five states and has inher@@ ited a coal business from his father .
it is worth $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee gave a declaration on Thursday evening in which it said : &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic party , which would rather prevent us from doing so in order to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 govern@@ ements and the control of the least legal entities in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , uni@@ fying message , &quot; said the R@@ NC President R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation to the C@@ BS News .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian exc@@ use for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; &quot;
the global leader of Ath@@ le@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e praised on Thursday what he described as an apparent exc@@ use from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to be res@@ umed in sport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian athle@@ tics boss D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were caught away with competitions gold and silver medals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF congress voted to maintain the prohibition that was imposed in November 2015 after a report of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) found evidence of state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e den Rep@@ or@@ tern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognised by itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for re @-@ establishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been achieved , but Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean ath@@ l@@ ete from the dep@@ ra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics world champion@@ ships that begin Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
the head of IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting .
drug tests are still insufficient and forbidden trainers are still free , said rep@@ or@@ ters in London after a lecture at IA@@ AF Council .
acts of mour@@ ning for Mali , crashed soldiers
at a fun@@ eral service in the North H@@ essi@@ an Fr@@ itz@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two soldiers killed in a helicop@@ ter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
to the even un@@ explained fall , Secretary of Defense Ursula von der Ley@@ en ( CD@@ U ) said nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she described the two opposite pil@@ ots , but as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of their professional . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow to this highest sacrifice , which they did in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen came life on Wednesday a week ago in the West African Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a dead watch of the Bundes@@ wehr to the Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er Dom St. Peter .
at noon , only the members of the church took leave .
after that the fun@@ eral service began in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general inspec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ eker .
Trau@@ erg@@ ä@@ ste laid down ro@@ ses , the relatives were arm in arm in the coff@@ ins .
in front of the church , Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ ers and numerous soldiers follow the ceremony on a canvas .
Minister of Defence of Ley@@ en described the in@@ verse soldiers as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and sat@@ anic .
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann under@@ took the flying operation of the figh@@ ter helicop@@ ter Tiger in Fr@@ itz@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger pil@@ ots of his reg@@ iment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the reg@@ iment , to whom the soldiers belong , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this occupation could not turn away the crash , it would not have mo@@ cked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no doubt about the UN mission in Mali , Minister of the Ley@@ en did not show : the use was dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of high significance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the fun@@ eral the coff@@ ins were taken out of the cathedral .
when and where they will be buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want a grave beside his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .
this divided the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculp@@ tor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ ag@@ us for the two .
the Queen agre@@ es with the decision of her husband , and she said further in the communication .
where Prince Hen@@ rik was buried , be still un@@ clear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret from it that he was not happy with his title .
after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would have liked to become king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he reti@@ res in 2016 and also covers the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prinz@@ reg@@ ma@@ hl &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equal to his wife - even not after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish Royal House .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , be un@@ clear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .

Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants a quick re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of potential majority in Lower Saxony
due to the loss of the red @-@ green government majority , Nieder@@ sach@@ sen Minister @-@ President Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the country , does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because on Friday it was speaking for the Parliament &apos;s dis@@ solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
prior to the surprising res@@ ign@@ ation of a Green Party from their Land@@ tag faction in Lower Saxony , the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) over@@ threw the government in a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the Sunday election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hannover lost its b@@ ang one @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the previous Green MP El@@ ke T@@ westen combined her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for election in 2018 in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ ü@@ mme ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained in Hannover on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD@@ U leader Björn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his faction to record it .
thus CD@@ U and F@@ DP would have 69 seats in the parliament parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far , the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
the new parliament will be elected regularly on January 14 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; red @-@ green country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; government must now decide whether it could continue to rule without a majority in this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Stephan Wei@@ l considers it imper@@ ative that the Parliament decides as quickly as possible its self @-@ resolution .
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state constitution also sees the possibility that the Parliament &apos;s parliament el@@ ects trust and cho@@ oses a successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution offers several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these options need to be legally tested , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in silence all the questions will be deb@@ ated if they are legally tested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ west@@ en &apos;s step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but something strange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;
she described herself as a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the sec@@ lu@@ ded member of parliament to return their country &apos;s mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we naturally assume that they have received their land mandate , which they have received over the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Group president of the Green Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret the decision by El@@ ke T@@ westen exce@@ ed@@ ingly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have deliberately decided not to make any pron@@ unci@@ ation in the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the res@@ ign@@ ation of the lower Sax@@ on Green Members El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conduct of the former green de@@ pu@@ ties in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of vot@@ ers , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the chief of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision by Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly re@@ dial the parliament .
the outlet west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the political scientist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her desp@@ ised van@@ ity and in her fr@@ ust her personal interests before the well @-@ being of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised the SPD Secretary @-@ General of Hubertus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony is doing this dirty intri@@ gue and tries to make it political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nieder@@ sach@@ sen &apos;s CD@@ U leader &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Björn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to include El@@ ke T@@ westen in the CD@@ U . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , designed v@@ ests to fal@@ si@@ fy the result of the 2013 Country election with personal career opportunities .
the CD@@ U was at that time in front of the SPD , the strongest force , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a w@@ afer @-@ thin majority of one voice in parliament .
Minister of Agriculture in an interview - How do we protect ourselves from gre@@ ed , Mr Schmidt ?
Germany is discussing poll@@ uted eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal pass ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
Minister of Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) , is in an interview with the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Mr Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from poison@@ ed eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp printing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Consumer Protection Portal www.@@ groc@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the Länder provide the latest information about the affected eggs .
infected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if , according to all we currently know , a health haz@@ ard is practically impossible .
does Al@@ di now take over the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the recon@@ n@@ aissance is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
in spite of this , my house has stopped immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany &apos;s concern .
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trade has just as well as the manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are traffic @-@ capable and health harm@@ less . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the level of resi@@ dues of the resi@@ dues of 0,@@ 00@@ 5mg / kg is exceeded , these are not traffic @-@ capable .
un@@ contam@@ inated eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time , not the businesses are to blame .
are factories and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
according to the current knowledge , the production companies do not meet any direct gu@@ ilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather , they have to reck@@ on with economic damage due to the alleged illegal practices of service companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as always , there is too little contro@@ l@@ ation in case of di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea .
is it only lacking in the personnel or also on the coher@@ ent competence ?
there were just the official controls that have un@@ covered the process .
the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be exp@@ elled to 100 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is precisely because of this , a consistent explanation of such events and the commit to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where criminal off@@ ences can be present are of decisive importance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already pointed out several times that I expect a complete explanation by the responsible authorities .
is regular al@@ arms in food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to only get secure and market@@ able foods . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a non @-@ licensed insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are ri@@ ghtly ou@@ trag@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by means of the pan@@ de@@ mic agent , manufacturers , tra@@ ders and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
basically it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ food @-@ supplying animals is not acceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately .
it has to be worked consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
I expect from all the competent authorities that the fact is quickly and completely elu@@ ci@@ dated .
how the financial rules of football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s rel@@ oc@@ ate to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ hin@@ dered spending of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from UEF@@ A , as the guiding organisation that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules , launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A , mean that at some point it has to prove that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major loss .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million dollars ) to buy the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a sal@@ ary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
PSG can certainly make the money loose , so that N@@ ey@@ mar ref@@ uses and bring him into a Galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team through the royal family of Qatar .
clubs may spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but have to deal with legitimate sources of income that allow them to take Bre@@ ak @-@ Even Point in their on the football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini following his election on the UEF@@ A presidential election in 2007 .
the former French player believed that associations who had taken enormous debt in their quest for success effectively che@@ ated and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 FF@@ P shi@@ fted from concentr@@ ating on the deb@@ ts of the clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the Roman Abr@@ amo@@ vich , originally used in 2003 in Chelsea , bought a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P submission period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini &apos;s 2015 has fallen from the Pres@@ idency of the Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEF@@ A successor , Aleks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , continues to shrink from excessive expenses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will definitely rein@@ force the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PSG has paid the buy @-@ out cl@@ ause from N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing over the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the proceeds for the next five years amoun@@ ting to 4@@ 4.1 million euros in the financial statements can be reported .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has taken the PSG alongside Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the tough@@ est sanctions .
the PSG was rewarded with a fine of EUR 60 million ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .
UEF@@ A is searching for clubs that could try to list their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenue from companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a cat@@ ar@@ ic company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate in@@ comes .
that &apos;s exactly what happened in 2014 , when UEF@@ A decided that the value of the PS@@ A sponsor@@ ship was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that some of the PSG @-@ payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come to Qatar via payments of the Organ@@ izing Committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar .
but PSG and Qatar will be cont@@ ested that N@@ ey@@ mar WM amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors will be won and an ar@@ gent man@@ oeu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators could be easy to find out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sanctions used to date against PSG mean that UEF@@ A will still be more attentive to any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PSG about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of an@@ onym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , as they were not fu@@ cked to discuss the PSG @-@ situation .
the last published reports show that , in 2015 / 16 , PSG 2015 / 16 generated a profit of more than € 10 million with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last financial year need to be published .
PSG expects that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s &apos;s arrival is a blessing for sponsor@@ ship @-@ De@@ als , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and Tri@@ kot@@ sell .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signing .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ enne &apos;s move by claiming that PSG would inj@@ ure the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PSG . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American sports @-@ ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations from La Liga against a state that finan@@ ces an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect financial fair@@ play because you can have different ways or have different interests when a country has such a major player to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is searching for a new product supplier
in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has produced board chocolate for Swiss .
now the close cooperation is facing a possible end : the airline re@@ writes the order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Swiss spokes@@ person Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed an appropriate report of the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on request of the news agency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to a quality control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , we are very satisfied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 17 million small red @-@ white d@@ ei@@ ties packed into 14 grams spread the flight att@@ endant before landing at the passengers .
Swiss does not want to make statements about the costs .
industry insi@@ der estimate the order volume according to &quot; North West Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the effect of advertising : it is a prestigious order for a shower producer .
the Swiss will not be able to reveal how many applicants do it with the new tender .
but only Swiss manufacturers are in question .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y aims at renew@@ ing the contract beyond the spring 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss chocolate producer was not re@@ achable for a statement .
chocolate tables distribute the Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
before the Swiss concluded a contract with Mig@@ ros daughter , Bar@@ ry C@@ alle@@ baut has delivered chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
the opportunity to place the logo , Swiss introduced two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ hau@@ l flights the customers of the First Class are p@@ amper@@ ed with goo@@ dies from the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi von Lin@@ dt and Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi distri@@ butes chocolate from Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in Business and Economy Class .

this re@@ petition of history is at the same time no@@ stal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80@@ s , for the 90 @-@ s @-@ Gr@@ unge era ( as the pione@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Sho@@ wal@@ ter turned the Sk@@ etch @-@ Com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to greater things .
as a cultural art@@ ef@@ act , it is equally a par@@ ody and a em@@ bodi@@ ment of our fac@@ ebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise it feels like the time would be short .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; surprisingly good , not just because of his absurd hum@@ or ( it contained an original story for a speaking tin vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by sti@@ cking to the core of the g@@ ag - middle @-@ aged actors play g@@ eile children who will grow - they nevertheless managed to win the final part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who are playing adults now , is less emotional rooted and his par@@ ody goes more according to the casting rod principle , including a reef on the 90 &apos;s stal@@ ker films like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ( &quot; Die Hand , die die Wie@@ ge schau@@ k@@ elt &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at one point , a character emerg@@ es through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gr@@ acious C@@ oop ( Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) still has not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy @-@ mal@@ ign@@ ant plot , included in the Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of fran@@ chise .
it is a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Rud@@ d who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons with whis@@ kers of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy .
it &apos;s the moments of random mad@@ ness that could heat this fran@@ chise as a kind of re@@ peti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he achieves what I wanted as his logical conclusion : &quot; wet Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose final scene will show the gang of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Amazon is remin@@ is@@ cent of a different kind of no@@ stal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and even to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; GLO@@ W &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its East @-@ West ring combat icon@@ ography . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the com@@ edy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka introduces R@@ hy@@ s Thomas as a director to be a found TV show : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est who are fighting for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ supported Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ si@@ c J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alogues by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt will be syn@@ ced in English .
it is an in@@ geni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to watch ( the police spend the time watching chess on television , as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of the famous actors - including Jenny Sl@@ ate , Nick offer@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent match &apos; Find out the voice &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is very committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a re@@ ag@@ an mask is involved - that it is often like a single one .
there are six long epis@@ odes , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; who was edited on a less length , could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef should always visit the American emb@@ assy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a pile of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message for the imag@@ ined Communist audience is that Western culture can do everything for a hunt .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own recent history and with thei@@ rs .
slaughter against drug ma@@ fia in the country
the police have succeeded in a blow against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar @-@ Kreis , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects were searched , such as the Public Prosec@@ utor of Con@@ stance on Friday .
15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
in addition , officials created greater quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand euros .
at the same time Raz@@ zi@@ en in Italy two people were arrested .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans .
the two are therefore likely to be shipped to Germany .
in the action , Italian and Bavarian vot@@ ers were involved .
more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
the members of the Maf@@ ia are accused of organised drug crimin@@ ality , serious acts of violence , attempted murder , as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s Office det@@ ects Con@@ stance against organised drug traff@@ icking in Southern Germany .
between the Public Prosec@@ ut@@ ations in Con@@ stance and Palermo was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .
therefore , the big effort on Wednesday morning was accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
in the course of the studies , Italian citizens mainly went to the Italian Maf@@ ia .
also an incident on 27 May in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the ban@@ de &apos;s account .
Weise lam@@ ents big gaps in the foreig@@ ner @-@ register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreig@@ ner register in Germany has considerable short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to partly serious mis@@ decisions regarding asylum procedures .
the Commissioner for the Federal Government &apos;s Refu@@ gee Affairs , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , report@@ edly drew attention to a media report to large gaps in the country &apos;s central register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could result in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; partially serious mis@@ decisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in an analysis referred to by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , ten million people are registered with foreign nation@@ ality , including some 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU states .
the data will therefore be ad@@ ministered by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany .
because the data had not been adequ@@ ately maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; data from 1921 has been found in individual cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from people who are no longer alive or of citizens who have become German citizens and are actually no longer able to appear in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ accurate data inputs can considerably slow down process &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the report continues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in statistics on foreign @-@ tax@@ ed people , the EU citizens are covered which would not have to leave at all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but such false orders led to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a dist@@ orted debate on dealing with tax@@ pay@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently begun to send refugee families back to Italy with under 16 year old children if they have entered it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this emerg@@ es from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Osn@@ ab@@ rück@@ er Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the paper it means that BA@@ MF will perform such procedures &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of inf@@ ants and inf@@ ants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , it was virtually no longer possible , so the newspaper cli@@ cked on the difficult situation on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin agreement is responsible for refugees of the EU state they first reach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the immig@@ rant country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the office now writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased considerably . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy accepted guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ rt@@ HR ) considers these commitments for sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other EU countries would return refugees back there within the Dublin Convention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the domestic spokes@@ person of the Left group in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , cri@@ tici@@ zed this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children thre@@ aten human rights violations due to the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian Asyl@@ um System and a threat to child welfare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
in a total of 220 litres of blood of people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach , blood donation service already provided for other people .
at least of the twelve citizens who were honored on Friday .
above all Ju@@ er@@ gen Gre@@ ule , who now shared 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations .
traditionally , in the meeting of the Municipal Council , the church ackno@@ wle@@ dges the multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in@@ geni@@ ous how our body is laid out for it and we have respect for the don@@ ors that make their blood available to stran@@ gers , nor un@@ sel@@ fish@@ ly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ lined mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood donation aid to several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the Kreis@@ ler leiter of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Ma@@ is@@ enb@@ acher , because the preserved foods are replaced in their constitu@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that way three people could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , Ma@@ is@@ enb@@ acher reported about the actions carried out in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K county manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the change to the theatre has led to higher number of participants a few years ago .
before that , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Um@@ lau@@ de were one of the multiple re@@ members and were awarded for 50 eff@@ ected blood donations .
half as many book Herbert M@@ air and Dor@@ o@@ thee Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ ro@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter gave ten times each 500 milli@@ liter of their li@@ veli@@ hood .
Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 %
the Bank of England is expected to be announced later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation over a rise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s@@ lugg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of a growing pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0,25 % , whereby fewer members stri@@ ved to increase in this month because weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly infl@@ ation@@ ary report , the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 increased to 1.6 % and warned that pressure on domestic income would continue , while inflation is expected to rise to almost 3 % in the fall .
but they sign@@ alized that interest increases were needed in the next few years to increase the inflation brought by the Bre@@ x@@ it and it said that the bor@@ rowing costs would have to rise more than expected in the financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw part of the mam@@ mot@@ h economic package that was issued a year ago after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will require time for the financial plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from the coming February , although it has been said that it is now expected that it will provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after deciding on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central pro@@ g@@ nosis of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , since pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at interest rates , it repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain stream@@ lining of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be required to cool inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; somewhat larger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scale than the markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank noted that increases &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradu@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would take place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
it retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell on this news opposite the dollar and the euro .
the Po@@ und fell by 0.5 % to $ 1.@@ 31 and fell by 0.4 % to 1.11 euros .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations of a interest rate , and GDP increased from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover slightly after the Bank at the end of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and negli@@ gible sal@@ aries , as the shar@@ pen@@ ing gets worse first before it gets better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy cannot be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevented &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she added that wages are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forec@@ asting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is attri@@ but@@ able to the weak Po@@ und , which is compens@@ ated by a lower consumption expenditure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision comes one year after lowering the interest rates to 0,25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the sin@@ king of the sound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy .
before the last sentence of the bank to interest rates , the call for interest was increased , as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three policy makers in July demanding an increase to 0.5 % .
inflation in the past month fell from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said this was expected and will attract it again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said the excess in relation to its target of 2 % is to be attributed to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the weak Po@@ und . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , director of Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent down@@ fall of the Sw@@ ap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive , as the bor@@ ro@@ wers want to search for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market is particularly good for those in which the existing De@@ als run out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is said to prescri@@ be controversi@@ al HIV drug 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment from September after a high court fight against the funding of the drug in the N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that a pre@@ exposure pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) taken before sexual intercourse , which can l@@ essen the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now being supplied by the health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he was willing to finance the process after the App@@ eals Court confirmed a ruling of the Supreme Court of Justice last year after the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p , despite the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should fund him .
the chess suit announced on Thursday was greeted by N@@ HS UK boss Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to enable people to register and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ exposure pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a sequence of HIV drugs that are taken before sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in case of infection .
pre@@ p prior to intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
clinics are identified to identify suitable participants who agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known as anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation at their local participating sexu@@ ality clinic .
the program will present £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence as it is systematically used , recorded and implemented on a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said St@@ ev@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in dealing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , if it is aimed specifically on ne@@ edy and endangered people , offers the possibility to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards people with high HIV risk have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is really controlled individually and is not subject to a negoti@@ ation with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cor@@ di@@ ally welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now , as the pre@@ p @-@ test medicine was obtained , we are on the best way to protect over 10,000 people infected with HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Shar@@ on Hod@@ g@@ son , Minister of Health , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delays and rel@@ uc@@ t@@ ant implementation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be a part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study will be carried out as soon as possible across the country to protect people who are HIV infected and that they will help to step closer to the dis@@ sem@@ ination of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment turned into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , res@@ igned in 2014 from a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; Jo@@ anne says .
&quot; I looked for something comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot large apartment was completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne storage room and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my request , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , they commissioned the Archit@@ ec@@ tural and Design Studio Duck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms together , so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the pro@@ position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were st@@ acked over one another without having to b@@ aken us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but to put the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled the Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper @-@ light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down via the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mir@@ r@@ ored gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role when adding theatre , space and light .
on both ends , a short cor@@ ridor is mir@@ r@@ ored to allow it to work longer .
in the kitchen , the mir@@ r@@ oring feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance we offer mir@@ r@@ ored units for all cut@@ lery and j@@ ars of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can shut the kitchen when it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important so that when you push the door , it is very easy to slide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things you touch and that will help create an emotional attachment in a home &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love the electrical sockets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and increased square metres of slightly standard@@ ly into something quite amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could choose not to leave it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brothers are fighting for a 500 million US dollar real estate empire &quot; &quot; &quot;
two brothers find themselves four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ n@@ asty in a debate on account of one of the largest real estate imperialist Vict@@ ori@@ as worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and designer Col@@ in De LU@@ TI@@ S lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to let clear how their property and their assets are to be divided .
Paul wanted to reti@@ re from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have acquired 38 real estate in the value of more than half a billion dollars , since then the family sold a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood in 1973 .
there , the West@@ co je@@ ans family founded and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for $ 85 million in 1999 .
this money was invested in real estate , and De LU@@ TI@@ S portfolio now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Brun@@ swi@@ ck and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
according to an agreement with her de@@ ceased father , Col@@ in - written by Paul as &quot; principal operator and the domin@@ ating personality &quot; in the De LU@@ TI@@ S family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul is about one third .
a court file states that this means that Col@@ in owns property valued at € 316 million and Paul has a value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the app@@ rais@@ als proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first mon@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place .
the brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , have excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but thro@@ ws Paul to manage some poss@@ essions in@@ competent .
in an early Aff@@ id@@ av@@ it filed by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; my Italian inheritance states that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with affir@@ m@@ av@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both parties held law firms .
Mrs De LU@@ TI@@ S and her de@@ ceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk @-@ bars and delic@@ at@@ essen stores from the late 1950 @-@ s and bought a shop in Brun@@ swi@@ ck in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the first Je@@ ans@@ load of the family .
Col@@ in says that he started West@@ co there when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De LU@@ TI@@ S says she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to share their property with her children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to come to court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De LU@@ TI@@ S Group , with Col@@ in claims that Mark had paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars in leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Luke and Mark are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; became bitter about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in has with@@ held himself very much although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography of the year 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media has contacted Col@@ in and Paul De LU@@ TI@@ S and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very very sad that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in writing to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said and added that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our affair will be solved in the near future by the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ umps of new Chief of Staff are planning to restri@@ ct the president &apos;s media ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
PO@@ LI@@ TI@@ CO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restri@@ ct the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course .
here is a piece of rep@@ orter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with executive employees on his first working day , he represented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps &apos;s White House that he wanted : bad information coming into the president &apos;s hands .
Kelly said the staff that information should flow through him - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by monitoring his media di@@ ets .
President Tr@@ umps &apos;s relationship to television last decades back - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if candidate Tr@@ ump was anno@@ yed because of un@@ fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of jobs that were to convince , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former election campaign manager Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February opposite Poli@@ tico . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ umps &apos;s Twitter habits under control , according to six ex @-@ election officials there is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
08.@@ 11.2015 &#124; Des@@ perate House@@ wives
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that Tr@@ umps &apos;s Twitter habits ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was ridi@@ cul@@ ous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps these campaign orders know something we don &apos;t know others - that m@@ umps without their interventions have included more fuel .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
if his staff managed to keep it away from him several times , their efforts have been worthwhile .
but no one has consistently prevented Tr@@ ump contro@@ vers@@ y .
a part of the problem is that people in a White House that consist of competing parties always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump material that may perhaps promote their views of the world .
PO@@ LI@@ TI@@ CO - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advis@@ ers to give the president dou@@ bt@@ ful information to the president for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by Rep@@ orter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts , especially those with cor@@ rupted le@@ aks , and that he tries to find out where they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone b@@ anned a printed copy of an article from Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ at@@ eurs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the dep@@ uty chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; being the source behind a bunch of le@@ aks &quot; at the White House .
although Johnson had been ban@@ ished permanently from Twitter for ch@@ ic@@ ans , or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he expressed false alle@@ g@@ ations in the past and re@@ vo@@ ke it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump read the article and started to ask employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ macher added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Porter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tried three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove to be an effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump still is his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ers still strive for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .

since the addresses of the searched heavy crimin@@ als are not known naturally , references from the population will be hoped and asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday of the action followed by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most W@@ anted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adv@@ ent calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences had been shown to hide many fle@@ eting on holiday destinations , it was called Euro@@ pol .
you have compiled 21 post@@ cards for selected crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 there is the website ww@@ w@@ .e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times it was viewed .
36 of the online spec@@ s could be captured so far , at least eleven of them due to indications after the publication on the website .
travelers negoti@@ ate over a dit@@ ch and return back to the &apos; milli@@ on@@ aire series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are again confronted with a few resol@@ ute passengers on the base of war , which have tra@@ ded a tr@@ ench from the municipality in order to claim a field in front of their man@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; travellers have par@@ ked their 20 caravan on a field outside a prosper@@ ous street of Soli@@ h@@ ull , called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; milli@@ on@@ aire &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were thrown out in May , without being deter@@ red by a tr@@ ench dig@@ ged by the Council to prevent their inci@@ dents .
the tac@@ tical group found a gap in the defense units and squ@@ ee@@ zed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
angry residents have urged the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous resident said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they went there on Monday , after they were forwar@@ ded by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the p@@ asser@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must indeed be forced by shame to implement it , as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were there in May , were moving forward and are now back again .
more came yesterday evening , probably today even more . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long instructions to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue to pay my municipal tax if the Council does not even stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an inhabit@@ ant who did not want to be called , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is ridi@@ cul@@ ous , we &apos;ve just seen the last round of these travelers , just to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the parking area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ person from the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; we are aware of an unauthorized camp in the country beyond Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to keep them moving as soon as possible .
to support our evidence collection , it is very important that as many residents as possible announce an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this contributes to creating a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we do our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is made from Birken@@ hof
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is located from the former Birken@@ hof hotel .
the house in front of the city of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on March 1 , next year .
they are good news for the city .
because with the closing of the Hotel Birken@@ hof through the then Ambiente operating company Ges@@ mbH on April 13 , 2014 , some 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and revenues from the tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in view of dramatically rising numbers of refugees who came to the district , the hotel building was offered to the council office as a collective accommodation , which provided controversi@@ al discussions .
the city prevented the lodging of asylum seek@@ ers by establishing a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disp@@ uted at that time in the municipal council .
but especially Freuden@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald was defending the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties in the house .
he should keep right .
the group of Lu@@ is@@ en@@ hotels with business manager Birgit Sch@@ erer whose seat in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star @-@ plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt house .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
they are called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ is@@ en@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof there have been tree @-@ container containers at the entrance , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear how extensive renovation works are made .
the floors were pulled out , ceilings partly demoli@@ shed , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the whole hotel building is a single building site .
until March there is still much to do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are built @-@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pretty bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses himself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment .
you don &apos;t want to position yourself at the high level of the hotel in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a high @-@ level city level , Sch@@ erer empha@@ sizes .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its approximately 60 rooms , wants to set up wide , explains Sch@@ erer further .
both individual holi@@ day@@ makers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel .
he has already led talks with OB Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause , so sha@@ ver .
the idea of the city is identical with those of the hotel group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are on the same line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer is not aiming to determine exactly .
under one million euros , he expects .
the external installations are also brought to the fore @-@ man , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace which will be open from the restaurant , which is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia affair : us special investig@@ ator sets off the Grand Jury
in the Russia affair about US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special investig@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller report@@ edly used a so @-@ called Grand Jury .
in recent weeks , the panel has taken up the work , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; calling on people familiar with the cause .
the newspaper took the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expanded and intensi@@ fied its investigations .
the transmitter CN@@ N reported that there are already initial inv@@ itations of the body in connection with a meeting between the el@@ dest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence services have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin since longer to have targeted interven@@ ing in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller investig@@ ates whether there were agreements between the Tr@@ ump @-@ Wahl@@ kamp@@ f@@ team and Moscow .
the investigation focuses on several men who acted in the election campaign as advis@@ er to the rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
report@@ edly , Mu@@ eller also recorded more and more m@@ umps of private and business environments under the micro@@ scope .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special investig@@ ator Tr@@ ump put personally in the center and investigate whether the president might have hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine the present evidence in possible break@@ dow@@ ns and decide whether it should be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called the Cham@@ bers of Indi@@ c@@ tment .
most of the time , they are turned on when they are larger and controversi@@ al cases .
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the committee can also be switched on by the public prosec@@ utor to charge persons for the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation under E@@ id .
according to the broad@@ c@@ aster CN@@ N , lectures have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who were involved in the meeting were asked for a statement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , they should provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. also Tr@@ umps advis@@ ers and son @-@ in @-@ law Jar@@ ed K@@ ush@@ ner and his head of his head Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were involved in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; legal experts said on Thursday evening on U.S. television that the enforcement will show that Mu@@ eller should not be shy in his work and that he should act fast if necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the survey of an indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the establishment of the Gre@@ ater was the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for the concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the theme gives the Democrats a possibility to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor , T@@ y Cob@@ b , explained in a statement that he didn &apos;t know anything about setting up a Grand Jury .
but they usually work in secret , he emphas@@ ised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House endor@@ ses any action that accelerated the work of the special agent in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former F@@ BI chief James Com@@ ey has said three times that not against the President . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one has no reason to assume that something has changed because of that , it continued to be explained in the explanation .
but Mu@@ eller was first used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
because of this repro@@ ach , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump had become no@@ isy , he wanted to im@@ pe@@ de the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
Com@@ ey said in June in front of a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to set an investigation against the National Security Ad@@ vis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the president is under great pressure because of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special investig@@ ator and its employees .
the dissolved spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wanted to dism@@ iss .
unlike an independent investig@@ ator of Congress like in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair surrounding the later retired President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he theore@@ tically could be fired upon crow@@ ding the president of the Ministry of Justice .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators put legislative proposals on Thursday , after which the special agent could no longer be dismis@@ sed .
Ant@@ arc@@ tica : gigantic ic@@ eberg drives in the Ant@@ arc@@ tic
in the Western Ant@@ arc@@ tic , a gigantic ic@@ eberg of the almost seven @-@ times size of Berlin is solved by the Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
this divided the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the large kol@@ oss thrust over a Bil@@ lion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometres to the north and will probably need two , three years until it was mel@@ ted .
with 175 km of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the past three decades .
there is no danger for people from him .
as far as climate change has played a role in the fall of the ic@@ eberg , according to research data , it is un@@ clear .
in total , however , there have been a series of unusual break@@ dow@@ ns in the region for around 30 years , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fact background .
according to many researchers , this can be related to global warming .
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus was part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by big gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is located south of South America almost at the top of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula .
the balance of w@@ axes and v@@ om@@ iting was disturbed some years ago .
a complete Sch@@ el@@ fest is cr@@ ushed there , A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes .
there &apos;s a lot to say that even the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is in danger , as the front edge never pulled back as far as currently .
in addition , the ice plate stands under tension and can fall apart if a piece is broken down on a key .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase sea level because they float on the water and put ice as much water as it results after the melting itself .
however , the loss of the Sch@@ el@@ fest leads to the fact that the gl@@ aci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the level of sea level , but only to a small extent , the British research project is writing to observe the Ant@@ arc@@ tic ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth largest Sch@@ el@@ fest in Ant@@ arc@@ tica with almost 50,000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural happening and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change , the ice sign comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists is cont@@ ested whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s will continue to grow or go back in the long term and possibly collap@@ sing , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man said and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even if these researchers do not fall back on climate change this gigantic ic@@ eberg , many ice tari@@ ffs of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula are falling apart over the past decades .
this long ker@@ is of the Ant@@ arc@@ tica extends towards South America .
according to the research program British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Survey , the ice surface of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 19@@ 50s .
the temperature rise has contributed to the decline .
the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula has been heated by around three degrees in the last 50 years , and there@@ with it belongs to the areas in which the temperature rises most quickly .
CD@@ U wants a hou@@ se@@ keeper with the staff
because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U calls for the employers &apos; association to get out of the employers &apos; association to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , 41 new jobs have been cut through in the administration .
more than 1,@@ 100 employees and officials work for the administrative district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
there are now 17 tra@@ inees their first day of work .
the teachers at the circle are obviously very sought @-@ after .
some 620 applications were to be recorded for the places in vain this year .
nevertheless , the circle is still missing in order to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
currently , there are 50 un@@ occupied jobs in the M@@ ett@@ mann district .
among other things , doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought .
the CD@@ U now wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and face the short@@ age of skilled workers in administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the administration should develop a concept for recru@@ itment and personnel development according to the parties &quot; wish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term demands to specialists , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented application scar@@ city , is it .
the overall concept should be oriented towards the inside and outside , demonstr@@ ating concrete action for cross @-@ star@@ ters and include an education offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a down@@ right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of the public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , there is a high number of employees who are leaving the service of disease or age due to age .
highest time for action so that no more jobs remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Daniel@@ s , Leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party .
he had long been sor@@ row@@ ed for a f@@ ist surprise when he publicly challenged personnel costs and ast@@ o@@ unded the other parties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people want all the possibilities to be checked , which allow a withdrawal from the communal employers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come short @-@ term to a satisfactory solution , the county administration should aim with the unions - perhaps also in co @-@ operation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the CD@@ U tries to better pay the employees and officials than it actually fores@@ ees bar@@ gaining for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money is only when you switch to a higher level oriented towards professional years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few weeks ago , new spaces had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitu@@ te protection law .
last but not least , the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy exac@@ erb@@ ates the sound of NGOs migrants &apos; lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs who use the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they should not continue this if they do not stick to new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs don &apos;t sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after Italian authorities had seized a boat from the German aid organisation &apos; Jugend ret@@ ches &apos; because their team had effectively collabor@@ ated with human traff@@ ick@@ ers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organization , which has been in operation for only one year , declined to express detailed alle@@ g@@ ations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Carto@@ si@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the saving of human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in an opinion on the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge all alle@@ g@@ ations that are being collected , only after we have gathered all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had watched the boat from &apos; Jugend ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , monitored since October .
it is thought that its crew adop@@ ts infl@@ atable migrants on board , which will be delivered directly by human traff@@ ick@@ ers , and that the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can depart so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such coinci@@ dence found only 1.3 miles in front of the Liby@@ an coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s acts , whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of ob@@ struc@@ ting the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue missions in the humanitarian grounds and not from any other motives .
under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats like the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta must above all have an Italian police officer on board that super@@ vis@@ es their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far been willing to stick to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be deemed unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Prize winner organisation doctors is without borders ( MS@@ F ) .
Minn@@ iti now said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations in Italy had declined sharp@@ ly in recent weeks , resulting in the efforts to strengthen Liby@@ an coastal guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced plans for further talks with Liby@@ an citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants who are leaving these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
nine women &apos;s bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berliner Aussen@@ border &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region to enjoy Tri@@ als and S@@ ights for four days .
there were three friendly guides available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ - and wine festival of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour took place during hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ desheim .
there followed view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could see far above the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest and the up@@ stream planes .
in between there were always longer asc@@ ents , for which long trips were rewarded .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and to the Volks@@ fest Wur@@ st@@ markt .
again , the look@@ out rested on a look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; fle@@ w &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
on the last two days a lot of altitude meters were announced .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and re@@ treats brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers inhal@@ e in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium cur@@ ative br@@ ine .
also Neustadt was also controlled .
after 173 kilometres and almost 4500 meters of altitude , the group met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga upgrades for e @-@ sport
are the sport stars in the future sit in front of computer con@@ soles , rather than fighting in the wind and weather over the stadium racing ?
fact : e @-@ sport has long been a serious business , has become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - great stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high levels inclusive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these have also recognized the first federal states that are increasingly involved in this field . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , followed by the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and launched two pro@@ s for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to am@@ a@@ ze new young target groups for V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there are still some clubs on this move . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Federation organiz@@ es the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or the PSV Ein@@ d@@ hoven have qualified .
also Robin D@@ ut@@ t sees great potential in E @-@ Sport .
the ex @-@ coach of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now advis@@ ing a virtual football player .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real football has to deal with the 14 @-@ 30 @-@ year @-@ olds , that the young people still go to the stadium in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the clubs tried to conquer any possible markets , especially the Asian .
with prominent E @-@ sport@@ s@@ men under contract , one could be far more often present on these markets than once a year to send the federal authority to Asia .
what is it all about ?
in E @-@ Sport , computer games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the football @-@ simulation FIFA on competition level are challenged .
long ago , as in normal sports , Li@@ es have established themselves , where the pro@@ s compete against each other .
and at the Asian Games , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it all a real sport ?
for many , the idea is certainly getting used .
Ingo FRO@@ B@@ Ö@@ SE also dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the German Sport School in Cologne E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is com@@ peti@@ tive and show many biological and physical reactions which can also be found in classical sports - for example increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
in addition , it needs cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a quick reaction .
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise on the console but also train their body and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fine player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but FRO@@ B@@ Ö@@ SE also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult to perform in online gambling , and in the scene the structures of classical sports lack@@ ed .
the scientist distingu@@ ishes the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport in a positive way .
the players are internationally on the move , that &apos;s like a big global family , there are no cross @-@ cultural obstacles .
a study by the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association Inter@@ aktive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predi@@ cts rapid growth .
in 2016 , 50 million euros were implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ship and big tournaments .
sales are expected to be at 130 million in three years .

Michelle Carter condem@@ ns to su@@ icide for the lyrics by Conrad Roy
a woman from Massach@@ us@@ etts has been sentenced to two and a half years because she has encouraged her friend through texts and calls to su@@ icide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years were exposed to prob@@ ation .
Carter was sentenced in June for a negli@@ gent violation of Conrad Roy , who took his life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until his appointment .
she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argu@@ ed that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a psychological illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ coloured bl@@ ouse , Carter rose with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and down@@ ward directed eyes when she was convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your actions have killed Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she showed no repentance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ters &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that they completely regret &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he did not find out that you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity or even your spiritual disease have a significant influence on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a prosec@@ utor read an explanation of Ro@@ &apos;s &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day in which I do not pray for the loss of my beloved son .
I want him to be proud of me and how I am with everything . I try to be there for eternity with us , in spite of all my p@@ ains that we will carry with us for eternity . &quot;
Gary &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she was &quot; persec@@ uted &quot; by the realisation that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or would be a aunt for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer this only person to have with whom I have been together every day since my birth , is a pain I will keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massach@@ us@@ etts which makes it a crime to ask another to commit su@@ icide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide poison@@ ing in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case attracted national attention after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that they encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hanging up , spring from a building , create yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is to switch to the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter &apos;s attention was looking for the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from any press .
the case has divided the legal opinion .
among the few who def@@ ended Carter , Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted for murder of her British ro@@ omm@@ ate in Italy in 2007 , before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Carter &apos;s compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua T@@ Kim@@ me was allowed to run as captain at the Audi Cup is no accident .
the FC Bayern dar@@ es a big season to the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner - Extra motivation is not there .
something was different in his place in the cabin , that Joshua T@@ Kim@@ me saw immediately , even if the additional garment was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m and also no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he made his split in his arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer has not announced it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner after his first use as Bavaria captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good , the one could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of Coach could also interpret Kim@@ mir as well .
not the eight @-@ year old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a game leader in the C @-@ elf designed by youth players , de@@ br@@ ators and just off holiday professionals , but he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sugar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is preferably distributed to those with a lot of tru@@ th@@ fulness that one wants to keep in the mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who were chosen to compete with the heir of Lah@@ m can only use a little extra motivation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kim@@ me confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player : assume responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old was fl@@ itz@@ ing over the field as a mini @-@ Lah@@ m .
right behind , that is now its position , the white ties at the arm did its rest .
and Kim@@ me also worked in this initial formation like the one who can best take the helm into his hand .
he gave orders , tried to direct the un@@ disp@@ uted tro@@ upe .
he had a look for the whole , while many others were busy with himself .
Vi@@ dal thus to over@@ play his missing fitness ( fol@@ dable not ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus to connect to the performance of the Asia @-@ trip ( fold only condi@@ tionally ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le to not neg@@ lect their first appearance in the Bayern Tri@@ k@@ ot .
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Sc@@ ene Inv@@ estig@@ ation ( TV )
Sü@@ le ran beside Kim@@ me , Rud@@ y before the defense , both ag@@ it@@ ated sover@@ eign@@ ly .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , in addition , Sü@@ le tried a couple of times in the game building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Rud@@ y admitted that the result &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wasn &apos;t as we hoped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; play rel@@ ocation , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this style I was also picked up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as usual this Bavaria world is still for the new entran@@ ces , one looked at the game after the game .
for example , Rud@@ y did not give one or two in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ me said goo@@ dbye to a few cris@@ p statements in the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard an interesting sentence from Sü@@ le : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what goes here I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria you just have to win any game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new one more .
Al@@ aba motiv@@ ates Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ ladies
David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
Austria &apos;s most well @-@ known foot b@@ aller has just announced on Twitter before the game and wished the Ö@@ F@@ B ladies all the best .
the Bavaria Leg@@ ion@@ ary is a quasi club @-@ mate of Ö@@ F@@ B captain Schn@@ ader@@ beck and fi@@ eb@@ ert with our lad@@ ys .
the twe@@ et of the Austrian football player of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motiv@@ ational bub@@ ble .

company satisfied with the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ sberg Tempo
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still the Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is seen after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chambers and companies from the region speak on T V demand of a change in economic policy - and at the same time ad@@ eln the old minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing pic@@ ks up the wishes of the economy that blocked Lem@@ ke all@@ es@@ amt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest turn @-@ around sees nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the brid@@ ging of highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and A@@ den@@ au is now at the top priority in the country &apos;s priority list .
this year the ministry hopes for a planning process to reach the right to 2021 .
a role in the plans of the country also plays the West Bank of Trier , which stands in the urgent need for the Bundes@@ verkehr@@ swe@@ ge@@ Plan .
the aim is to take the route in operation in December 2020 , says Minister of the Minist@@ eri@@ eship Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
of course , nat@@ us sees a sign for supporting regional , but internationally competing companies .
the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) stri@@ ves to produce a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate @-@ label with wine , in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German exports for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , praise the Chamber of Commerce .
the Handwerk@@ skammer Trier considers the new master bonus an additional incen@@ tive for young tra@@ inees , says managing director Matthias Schwal@@ bach .
a premium of € 1000 is provided for the completed master examination and 2500 euros when graduates stay independently within ten years of master training .
but the hom@@ ew@@ ork list for the country remains long .
in the planned road construction , there are quick facts to create , at the same time out of the country the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Managing Director of the I@@ HK Trier .
of 56 new engineers who want to employ Wis@@ sing at the state @-@ run mobility , only 29 jobs have been occupied until now .
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more assign@@ ments to external offices .
Christian Bald@@ auf &apos;s CD@@ U leader refers to calculations of the accounting station , the country invested in 2017 and 2018 more than EUR 20 million less in the preservation of country roads than suggested .
in addition , Frank nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country as to how it wants to solve the short@@ age of skilled workers in the region .
furthermore , the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country is also so@@ ber@@ ing .
in 2016 regional companies had only rated net supply in an I@@ HK survey only with the rating of 3.4 .
they compl@@ ain about stock@@ y internet connections and break@@ through@@ s .
ex @-@ Economic Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , on the other hand , is out of politics and is still sitting on the board of wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become the President of a private college in Karlsruhe - where she dre@@ amed up the field after four months because of discre@@ pan@@ cies .
Audi should change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction
one day before the announcement by Audi , BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW president said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are smar@@ ter options than driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and thus moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - to ban or restri@@ ct diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles to be modified in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as recall .
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are regarded as car@@ cin@@ o@@ gens and can cause as@@ thma .
the cost of car manufacturers , systems to neutr@@ alize the exhaust gases em@@ itted by diesel vehicles , also accept what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of rej@@ ecting the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
the companies are trying to avoid the errors of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called de@@ preci@@ ation devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car has been tested , but return to normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several accused were accused of Volkswagen , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month the former Head of Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is an Italian and is therefore not protected from ex@@ tradition and could be brought to court in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi to have installed a system to b@@ ypass the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States has been extended .
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer has disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ately contributed to Volkswagen profit .

Mor@@ dil@@ los kn@@ uck@@ les and laugh@@ ing against the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the most widely published carto@@ on @-@ patterns , the n@@ oses of his characters are his trademarks .
also with 85 the Argent@@ ine@@ an is still working and working on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he was among other things as a drawer for gambling cards - which fru@@ str@@ ated him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , he succeeded in the end of the 60 &apos;s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artists were inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures lie in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , he is still sitting at the drawing table today , works almost ten hours a day .
via cal@@ end@@ ars , puzzles , books for young and old , T @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush animals and clo@@ cks , his dro@@ ll figures continue to spread worldwide .
for six years he has been working on a carto@@ on film and a TV series with his characters .
the protagon@@ ist in the film &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los popular animal in his drawings - who has a thous@@ and@@ ler as a counter@@ part .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , which is to come to the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the scre@@ en@@ play is not written by him .
that &apos;s why he tends to rely on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced without wor@@ dless .
lav@@ ender from Provence under threat of climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the lav@@ ender is decl@@ ining because of the conditions remin@@ is@@ cent of d@@ rought , and due to the diseases of transmitted insects , leading scientists and farmers trying to find solutions to find great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , Expert of the Agr@@ arian Research Institute CRI@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in the past years , which brought much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn .
this has effects on the lif@@ esp@@ an of lav@@ ender .
there is also a small ic@@ ic@@ ade , a micro@@ bi@@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf c@@ ades , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
lav@@ ender oil attracts not only for holi@@ day@@ makers , it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Eric Cha@@ isse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of having very long vegetable oil with a large number of flowers we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered are better water distribution and the slow@@ down of ev@@ ap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to d@@ rought .

assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own trag@@ edy , they came together to talk about security .
it was told to them that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels more secure : they should take their children to the office , who were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home .
security experts wrote three words on a table on the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies .
they ask the rep@@ or@@ ters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and gut feelings .
there are drug sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the pay@@ roll of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalog of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no break from violence , and while the cor@@ p@@ ses accum@@ ulate throughout the country , more and more journalists are involved : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to has taken office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are at least seven dead in seven countries .
among the latter you find their editor and their inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence will be felt deep , although his presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hang@@ s on the façade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two rep@@ or@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez wear T @-@ shirts that show his sm@@ iling face with glasses or his typical Panam@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the rep@@ or@@ ters discuss their shared themes , trau@@ ma , night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a Special Pro@@ of Office has been established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , it has initiated only two criminal proceedings , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most thousands of mur@@ ders , each year associated with drug traff@@ icking and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to court .
at Ri@@ odo@@ sia , they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are not del@@ ectable and although the terrain is now even more ob@@ s@@ essive .
without information on the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very stup@@ id to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the reason , we all mi@@ str@@ ust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he was only able to ride a few blocks before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and was shot 12 times , probably due to the name of the newspaper , which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ fth river . &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and delivery to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the country &apos;s blo@@ o@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields , as ri@@ val fac@@ tions struggle here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or more people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of ornam@@ ented , two @-@ storey m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug @-@ kings who are bigger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of peace if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drugs trade routes in the United States .
nevertheless and despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , broke down with the gu@@ ilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
at first there was in February the publication of an interview with Damascus Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the ri@@ val anti@@ trust groups in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this release may have anger@@ ed the sons , gan@@ try members bought every copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same story , leaving the country for its own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced rep@@ orter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined five colleagues in the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without viol@@ ating the tox@@ icity problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with time , the newspaper earned a reputation for the cour@@ ageous and honest reporting , and sales and public@@ ity increased .
rep@@ or@@ ters loved to publish hard @-@ hit examinations without fear of c@@ ens@@ orship and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to treat .
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot @-@ Award &quot; for her reporting in Latin America .
in the same year Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists from pursuing Mexican drug policies wherever they lead .
he volunte@@ ered to be afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug traff@@ icking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take over the task which you as a journalist coinci@@ des - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in the face of so many dead ... why did you not tell what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team missed val@@ dez , the fun bird , who was like a do@@ ck@@ workers , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table there .
now ask them : was his love for routine his destruction ?
his death also forced them to question their own assump@@ tions about how they best do their work and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it if you deal with their wives , their children , their clean businesses , their secret starting and run@@ ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ c@@ ens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust your own inst@@ in@@ cts .
if it sm@@ ells fal@@ seh@@ ood , stay away .
the anger is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing happened with Javier . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a poison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape is changing constantly .
in the space where the employees of Ri@@ odo@@ ce came to safety training , no mobile phones were allowed . days ago it became known that spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a middle @-@ class district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the jo@@ ke , some of the rep@@ or@@ ters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who the governor himself considered not trust@@ worthy .
it &apos;s months since the rep@@ or@@ ters have gone into the mountain landscape where the drug gangs are de fac@@ to under control .
for the issue of this week Ri@@ odo@@ ce gave birth on three main stories .
there was assass@@ ination of the brother of the former famous speaker Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an exposure to the public expenditure concentrated on the home town of the governor .
and there was a group going through one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the Office of the Prosec@@ utor .
there was no official word about who was kid@@ n@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was offered when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a rep@@ orter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which ruled nearly the entire century all political levels .
recently several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the rep@@ orter to write about previous inci@@ dents in this restaurant , including one where a son of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few months before , readers of Val@@ dez had considered the best informed source of the ab@@ duction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of its slender body stat@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office became a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
re@@ or@@ terin Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez quickly sn@@ apped a few signs and went next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist at the Office of the Public Prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body was detected and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the whole country journalists have become lou@@ der by writing in organized protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SOS Press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on side@@ walks and buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on this day director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone out in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez .
during a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to pi@@ onate journalists and bring them back because they said the truth .
she has been asked since then that she is re@@ group@@ ed by the government because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her objec@@ tivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , government officials and a indiffer@@ ent society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that rep@@ or@@ ters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces which stuck with organised crime under a ceiling .
&quot; artic@@ ulo 19 &quot; media fan group has been assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists from police and civil servants last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to hold your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the mur@@ ders have a det@@ err@@ ent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her body was found along with a note that was suppos@@ edly signed by the CEN@@ TRA@@ L cart@@ el : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer keyboard and head@@ set lay next to her separated head .
some branches have chosen to close the newspaper El Norte in the northern border @-@ state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue on how it did El Man@@ ana von Nu@@ evo Laredo after the assass@@ ination of their director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page &quot; What do you want of us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they hunt , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was assass@@ inated in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue working , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be po@@ ets , adm@@ its that drug traff@@ icking det@@ ects it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I became rep@@ orter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the pav@@ ement in front of the office and drinking beer , as suddenly all their phones began to sum@@ mon .
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with band ri@@ val and security forces near the seaside resort Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued escal@@ ating as promised by a series of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from the on@@ board edge they published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on cell phone .
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ ren how@@ led nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez did a look at the police officers who kept watch to see if they were in readiness .
if they were afraid they did not show it .
under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper whose middle finger was visible for all of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you only think about closing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If on the same day Javier was murdered , the intern asked me to send her to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ r used cam@@ ouflage to sof@@ ten his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , al@@ beit a fri@@ ghtening .
researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the incredible r@@ hin@@ oc@@ eros of a Canadian min@@ ers have been so well received that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was so well received that they could even notice that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said she had something of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; troubled past &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best @-@ held din@@ osau@@ r who has ever been found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of no@@ dos@@ aut , which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ina between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his incredibly well @-@ preserved state has amazed researchers , which describe it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant fres@@ ser is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was on March 21 , 2011 at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b .
he met something that seemed to be out of place from the surrounding rock , and decided to look more precisely .
the fossil discovered by it was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 lb ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy earth pump@@ ing .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you smile just a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chief au@@ tor Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creature is to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found that these her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , although it is covered with an arm@@ or and resem@@ bles a changing shell , probably threatened by meat @-@ eating din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique , which is known as a counter @-@ sh@@ ad@@ owing , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed it to be better to mix in its surroundings and to avoid its enemies , experts say what was suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ u@@ rier has made head@@ lines in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ ent@@ ch@@ elli after the museum techni@@ cian Mark Mitch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,@@ 000 hours with it carefully .
the aston@@ ishing maintenance of the specimen made it possible for Dr. Mitch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
they discovered the c@@ asket , a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was dar@@ ker than its under@@ side .
although the c@@ asket is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sur@@ passes by far the animals living today .
it suggests that the din@@ osau@@ r has been hun@@ ted by enough pressure by eating meat eaten din@@ osau@@ rs that the evolution fav@@ oured the conce@@ al@@ ment of confront@@ ation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals , who use the counter sh@@ ading - think of roe deer , zeb@@ ras or ma@@ sts - are much smaller and more vulnerable than lo@@ ot , which signals that this No@@ dos@@ cope was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs pre@@ dat@@ ors have had to be the cra@@ yon season , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to examine the animal on evidence of his life , including his con@@ served intestinal content to find out what it has eaten as its last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , fell into a river and driven out into the sea , where he sank down to the se@@ abed .
at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as South Fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably circul@@ ated much further inland than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with con@@ served foot@@ wear , but also remains in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same today as in the early chal@@ k period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to recon@@ struct it . if you &apos;re just playing a little bit with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is sleeping . &quot;
the cra@@ yon was a time when huge ther@@ op@@ ods , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , standing on two legs , passed through the earth .
although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes the Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
the scientists , whose latest findings are published in the journal Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was buried after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in slu@@ dge .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was on March 21 , 2011 at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b .
according to the museum , it is the uphol@@ stered din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch sp@@ ik@@ es rag@@ ing from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es swe@@ pt through the western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the water cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ r preserved its arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the Hau@@ tes still cover up b@@ ump@@ y ar@@ mor@@ ed ar@@ mor@@ ed plates along the din@@ osau@@ r .
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a win in the lot@@ tery .
the more I approach it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the hol@@ lowed shell @-@ plates that carry the skull of the animal .
his right front foot rests on his side , his five fingers are spread upward .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can count the scales on his sole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the th@@ under@@ storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A8 : many injured
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : nearly 30 vehicles are wrapped in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous wounded , kilomet@@ re long St@@ aus and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , approximately 20 people were injured during a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on Thursday afternoon .
after the first data of the police arrived at 17.00 clock between the connecting stations Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a th@@ under@@ storm nearly 30 vehicles , among them probably trucks , crashed .
there are no indications of the exact number of the last ones .
it was a slight to moderate injury , said a police spokes@@ man .
a large amount of ambul@@ ance equipment was at the accident point .
the A8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of Munich , a ten @-@ kilomet@@ re back@@ log was formed .
as reported as a AZ rep@@ orter , it also occurred on the counter @-@ track to massive handic@@ apped - through numerous g@@ aff .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade noted the signs of the vehicle steering , which now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 6 : 45 p.m. another second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a colli@@ sion between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a helicop@@ ter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group test &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced at once : nothing striking is sitting in the train and sleeps .
or you are deep@@ ening in his work and just has an in@@ geni@@ ous thought .
and then : buff@@ ered .
comes the conductor and w@@ akes a smooth or irrit@@ ates the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
car@@ bu@@ ret@@ tor pul@@ ley .
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the freel@@ ance trol@@ ley control .
you simply confirm by phone that you take your seat and vali@@ date the ticket .
currently , a test run runs on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the offer depends , we extend it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will then be available in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the way ticket de@@ valu@@ ation without she@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to be able to use it , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - which is already the most passengers .
it is also necessary to have purchased the DB Navigator app , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking .
and finally you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works so : you get into the train , call his ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the test customer then appears a button for electronic de@@ valu@@ ation .
the train companions get a message on their mobile devices that Pass@@ enger X is on the train and the booked seat Y has taken place .
when the train driver comes to Space Y , he knows that there is a passenger with an already vali@@ dated online ticket .
so one can continue to sleep , continue to remain silent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the railway - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to travel safely without ti@@ ck@@ eting supervision by our train crew , you simply check yourself in the DB Navigator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this allows the passengers to design their travel time on the train of personal trains , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peters@@ on , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Marketing Executive Board of DB Fern@@ verkehr &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often take the train know that apart from delays and missed trains , the trol@@ ley @-@ control rolls are one of the biggest sleeves .
because of@@ ten@@ times one does not have all the documents required for the de@@ valu@@ ation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document you have to show .
the result is endless discussions between train companions and passengers , which leads to bad mood in the section or large @-@ space and delays in controlling their own tickets and the conductor at the end takes the time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that is only on trains ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further train numbers on the same track are not yet available .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; wh@@ os@@ wh@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken to its core .
just one day after having arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b flat which she rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled upon a post from someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police had just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and there is still on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she named it there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused as nobody else had posted the information on their feed , she concluded Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly saved on her tim@@ eline .
the r@@ apper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , live to twe@@ ets .
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s empty body stretched on the street and stayed there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thought Fer@@ rell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she stopped her cell phone to return to Twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive in the evening .
there were photos of the police band and people who cried out , and from a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father who wor@@ e a shield with the in@@ scription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed in which a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bar@@ king dog .
in another video , she said , escaped another polic@@ eman his ri@@ f@@ le and cried , &quot; I will kill you ... Animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell remembered her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we have become ac@@ custom@@ ed to and which we can call it typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this moment I felt sho@@ cking .
I was angry and we@@ pt . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she picked up her six @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the theme of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as of the 11th century .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance to people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers .
as Fer@@ rell with her daughter , who carried a flower dress and a matching crown to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation that they had many times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I could not take it with me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know it and see it and be drawn up in it .
it must be well developed not only activ@@ ism and organisation but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves .
even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience ec@@ lat@@ ant rac@@ ism , she is no different from the next black woman child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would be doing a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first stop , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a Camp@@ aig@@ n when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ prosecution of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined a local business owner , who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rell &apos;s shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely after 9 August , &quot; she said and not@@ ices that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on eating justice and health ine@@ qualities in black churches .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it is all come . &quot;
weeks later Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an during an evening demonstration , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ eram@@ an Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came to Fer@@ rell : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often by wh@@ ites - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and their res@@ ili@@ ence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had heard that people born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not cent@@ ered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ dest@@ ra@@ kt &apos;s in@@ mates .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rell the project , along with six other n@@ atives , the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns was shot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us . we speak , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me , how these people will be represented , for so I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ el &apos;s experience - to show that it is not a m@@ essi@@ ah leader but a community that comes together , &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ els &apos;s life as she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the de@@ human@@ isation of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ ero &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , which after killing the black teen@@ agers Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 marked the film &quot; Black@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must bear the main burden of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when Fer@@ rell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sho@@ ok this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no accident , although it was at the foref@@ ront , because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
in the meantime , the news security cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the r@@ acial connections between the community and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rell is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a chaos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
still she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels committed to this memory , since she went to the street three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we need to love and support one another .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; Traum &quot; to &quot; Size W@@ ap &quot; : TV @-@ readers discuss bit @-@ gallery
the bit gallery moves the people , although it is not built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping center at the south end of the pedestrian area spl@@ its the population into pro@@ ponents and opponents since the first presentation of 2009 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cold &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is scar@@ c@@ ely cold . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg , &quot; the topic is discussed .
while the one to the bit @-@ gallery says : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; Das wäre real klasse &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , kommt von der anderen Seite : &quot; braucht kein Mensch &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) oder ganz einfach : &quot; Size w@@ ahn ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while the pro@@ ponents stress that a gallery with@@ draws more customers into the city , from which the other businesses profit , the ad@@ vers@@ aries fear that the pedestrian zone ble@@ eds .
added : the gallery is planned exactly on the plot on which the farmers market hall stands in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products .
with the start of construction work will stop .
the Galerie @-@ M@@ acher wants to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Bed@@ a Square with the possibility to sit outside .
Simone Zimmer : &quot; for many years we have been selling almost weekly in the farmers market hall .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farm women again and again very gladly .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s egg for us .
we would wish that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery a chance exists to maintain this offer .
there is also this in other cities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct mark@@ ers can settle in a market hall in the gallery , comes to the height of the rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this should not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why shopping bags in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find it unnecessary .
there are plenty of them in our city .
you can see how many shops here stand here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall is maintained .
because after all the goods offered there is fresh , mostly offered directly from the producer and is priced at the top price .
as you can see , store stores in a shopping centre are rented by larger companies , because the local rent is often not portable for a retailer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ ity , specialty shops are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping center with a market hall does not fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where is the farmers market hall going to be during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit @-@ gallery actually arrives at some point .
or does it create the ghost bit @-@ gallery already before , to distribute all stores from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it just won &apos;t work .
and a shopping center that is empty also doesn &apos;t need anybody .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery .
but for a farmers market hall there is no place thanks to the mad many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when the farmers market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which almost im@@ percep@@ ti@@ bly resem@@ ble the cables hanging from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather D@@ ew@@ ey @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ fern and hair@@ cuts sent to her by Chelsea M@@ anning .
M@@ anning sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former Intelligence @-@ Analy@@ st verb@@ alized a 35 @-@ year sentence after publishing his secret diplomatic reports on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks site .
the new exhibition opened on August 2 is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( a matching simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between D@@ ew@@ ey @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline encomp@@ ass@@ ed her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and M@@ anning , a Trans@@ woman and pione@@ ering dis@@ sident , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office .
D@@ ew@@ ey @-@ Hag@@ borg &apos;s algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA , which was extracted by M@@ anning and created from the 30 portraits , like someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data could look a sharp , even if something intellectual comment does not only lead to the form@@ ality of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations , but also for identity .
M@@ anning who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has been openly spoken of identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was convic@@ ted for 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age network , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison her picture was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white self @-@ ie where M@@ anning is visi@@ bly un@@ comfortable sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ ine blonde wig with which she was associated .
in 2015 , D@@ ew@@ ey @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of her 2012 project &quot; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions . &quot;
in this , the artist produced portraits of stran@@ gers from for@@ ensi@@ c art@@ ef@@ acts like cigar@@ ette dum@@ b and ch@@ ew@@ ing g@@ um by extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look .
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea M@@ anning while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained D@@ ew@@ ey @-@ Hag@@ borg during a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photograph@@ ed so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her im@@ pris@@ oned m@@ use became un@@ equal bri@@ efs who had several letters exchanged over the course of two years .
they even created a comic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o , who predi@@ ct a future in which the president would transform Chel@@ seas judgement and would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ings &apos;s release after seven brutal years would demand in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome type of happy meeting .
there is also at the opening of the exhibition a little deep and strong , since Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government and against trans@@ gender forces to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to avoid the rigid fis@@ sur@@ es he should actually fix .
when D@@ ew@@ ey @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about all these things after the strange timing , she said &quot; things are going to happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in a artistic statement written on the wall of the Gallery , M@@ anning with her super@@ large signature including ( the &quot; i &quot; in her sur@@ name has been marked with a heart ) an end to the &quot; automatic split &quot; which basis gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
on the opposite wall , its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ ome of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
D@@ ew@@ ey @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific lex@@ icon of the artist ) , how aston@@ ish@@ ingly similar , at least in a biological sense , we are all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what people will hopefully take along is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care about who we are and how open genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ ew@@ ey @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories . &quot;
the last piece of the exhibition , stored in a separate room , is a page from the above mentioned comic nov@@ els .
she shows M@@ anning how she emerg@@ es from the disciplines of the United States like King Kong with a hands @-@ talk phone in his hand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they strike your speech , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets out of Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
p@@ anning did not see the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it was supposed to do it , it will be welcomed in the center of the room by the mas@@ ks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ res that assemble like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also pur@@ pos@@ eful as everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ atur ) , with which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ ew@@ ey @-@ Hag@@ borg from portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also hiding behind their liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and an employee of Oxford University for killing
a nation @-@ wide ch@@ ase is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee at Oxford University who are looked for as susp@@ ects after a man had been killed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries .
on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) issued arrest warran@@ ts for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , such as the Ac@@ ting of the Local Court of C@@ ook County .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches .
a community warning system published by the Chicago police authority states that the body was discovered on 27 July .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead at the place of the event , and det@@ ec@@ tives investigate the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively seeking the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
since 2007 La@@ Belle is an extraordinary Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ a has now been in a trial and excluded from entering the North@@ western University campus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal case investigated by the competent authorities and the North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker at the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in Great Britain to help the U.S. investig@@ ators in any way possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were sho@@ cked and want him to stand .
chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he ur@@ ges the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police has an idea of her where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to loc@@ alize her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities are helping to find susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip who said that in apartment 100@@ 8 something happened .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ it and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management team at Grand Plaza published an explanation of the residents : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and expl@@ ores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will close the WA@@ DA Road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian Deputy Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t last long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( Rus@@ ada ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , Rus@@ ada has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK anti @-@ dop@@ ing ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA &apos;s road@@ map to comply with the code describing the criteria for the re @-@ establishment of Rus@@ ada and recently published on the website of the organization .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not include anything that could cause Russia to concern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the criteria mentioned in the list however states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of the study approved by the WA@@ DA prosec@@ utor Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren on alleged state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no government programs and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ ua &apos;s words voted with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing Commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales office at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov made problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversi@@ al positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condi@@ tionally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rus@@ ada was exp@@ elled in November 2015 in the course of the dop@@ ing sc@@ andal of WA@@ DA by the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , you were allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
following a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow organization in July , WA@@ DA general director Olivier Nig@@ gli said that Rus@@ ada is moving &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .

the start @-@ ups that will help your business not become the next U@@ ber
Amy Er@@ got@@ t wanted to measure luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - dec@@ eit@@ ful .
and even if you promised an@@ onym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ got@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care society Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has called people from outside for help .
a new breed of Human Resources start @-@ ups is at the w@@ ax@@ ing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of the measurement of employee engagement , it enables companies to offer surveys , to provide employees an@@ onym@@ ity and complaint @-@ hot@@ lines , and in some cases allow W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ n to b@@ ypass the C @-@ Suite executives and address themselves directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for pursuing their health , but where is Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees commitment .
saved as a favorite to look at new things you post ... &#124; Hello , just wanted to mention , I liked this article . it was funny . keep oon posting ! &#124;
in addition to the Sn@@ ap @-@ surveys and surveys from certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company , which shows at a glance which units have the most dis@@ comfort and which managers have low requirements - so that you can prove why .
companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain , so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber that has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of nu@@ is@@ ances where those who have spoken are pun@@ ished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this desire for an overview is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
the global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the finance technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ all in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Con@@ ver@@ cent has almost 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
u@@ ber has recently signed up as a client .
like G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent enables companies to send tailored &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also offers anonymous SMS hot@@ line , which allows employees to report bad behavior .
and if the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the super@@ visory board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of Public Opinion colle@@ cts the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company is found that treats its employees badly or beha@@ ves un@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences by consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and law@@ suits , said Quin@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,@@ 000 employees and more than 500 locations , has used conc@@ er@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and processes and have a simple way to achieve their corporate headquarters .
earlier , if a def@@ endant wanted to report a problem , he or she found a phone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation and un@@ comfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ YS General Coun@@ sel who said there was no good opportunity to track the complaints of employees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now that the company employs Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that were hidden in offices in cities or states have been hidden - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ fair intern@@ s more quickly identified and addressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to re@@ ap ethics , values and collabor@@ ators in 2002 seriously after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations due to the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Quin@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies knew that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and charge the companies with recur@@ ring charges for the use of their products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a business model and a chance to find investors with the consent of Venture Capital who have supported both start @-@ ups . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February by companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the total capital was raised to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz@@ ers insured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought up total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees of their jobs expect more than before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are just assign@@ ments .
the employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company , feel that their voices heard , and that the work that you do is worthwhile , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both conc@@ er@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t .
investors gain a reputation if their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and committed .
when the analytics tools of third parties ple@@ dge to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data are useless if the administrators of a company do not take action .
in fact , if a company asks staff after your feedback , it may have an expec@@ tation that change is on the way .
and if the change is not fast enough , or not at all , this can grow dis@@ appointments and motiv@@ ate employees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you need to be willing to have 4,000 talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management firm Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies who have reli@@ ed too much on collecting data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow people wondering , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now performs monthly employee surveys , was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , so saving .
and after collecting feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated staff , it was able to re@@ organize multiple teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
with Ruby Tuesday the company will always gain new insights into the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to better binding of workers in a branch that is known for high sales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers then you will lose companies .
the N@@ CA@@ A remo@@ ves the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Bru@@ ins
it starts at 23 o &apos;clock , when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers talk on one side of the team &apos;s new practice fields .
some have stri@@ pped off their jer@@ sey items and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these idle minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are en@@ rolled in the summer courses will return to their final ex@@ ams after the three @-@ hour exercise before returning next morning at 6 : 30 o &apos;clock to the Water@@ man Football Center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the guys over the next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday became Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three trainings of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already fully packed sched@@ ules of the players .
the compromise between the two days is more than a day in which the Bru@@ ins shi@@ fted the start of the camp nearly one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as , six play times in West@@ wood performed practical exercises .
they should hold 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before the start of formal playing preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said he supported the change in rules of the N@@ CA@@ A even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they just pushed it through , they plac@@ ken themselves further , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practice as soon as the camp is finished , what in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class , which has already been thrown with foot@@ balls , which will have a protection net behind a door@@ post , no easy task will be .
brood @-@ Players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people will hire a room there and then hire there to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video tape from an exercise , it is a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
that is why I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts verification in the fight against f@@ ake messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fal@@ seh@@ oods to third party fac@@ tions and show their results below the original article then said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it &apos;s one of its efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake News .
the company said in a statement on his website that it will begin with the use of updated Machine Learning Methods to identify possible counter@@ fei@@ ting and to send them to fac@@ simile check@@ ers which may display results from the invoice check out of the original article .
Facebook has been cri@@ tici@@ zed as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called F@@ ake News , many believe they have also influenced the 2016 presidential elections .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , whereas the French vot@@ ers have been floo@@ ded with wrong stories in May , and Germany supports a plan to be pun@@ ished by social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate h@@ asser@@ ed post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate declaration in English that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new facts verification will be started .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the insight that stories of fac@@ ten@@ ants are challenged third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in connection &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and work on other changes to his news feed to reduce false news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a novel novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the small Scot@@ ney Castle was featured in a squ@@ e@@ eze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 @-@ s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his comfortable seat in the Main@@ stream River valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ i@@ red Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says melanch@@ oly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac steering ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des that is based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only responded to the thum@@ b pressure on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thum@@ b print ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell smoke , because at that time one lighted a fire because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself .
ah , I love Archive ! &quot;
for someone who is sm@@ itten with old papers , he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and lived for almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome greeting &quot; ) seems to be all too nice to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , to see the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mon@@ eted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he wander@@ ed through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and talked to landscape parks , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he d@@ rank whis@@ key and started writing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust received full access only in 2006 , when the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when Rho@@ des met a decade later , the employees started to take care of the archive that he said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hundreds of years in which ari@@ sto@@ cr@@ ats said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of English emp@@ ires , maps representing what possessed : &quot; one could think that country conflicts would be boring , &quot; Rho@@ des says , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families .
&quot; &quot; &quot; guys , let &apos;s go to his walk ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se in the English history on a broader basis , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant u@@ prising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a recording of an u@@ pro@@ ar that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; King &apos;s Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Rho@@ des says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant u@@ prising began in this area and I thought an u@@ prising was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ers that the Dar@@ rell family hid during the English Reformation seven years .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , portra@@ yed by the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rell from the 18th century , who produced his own fun@@ eral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentle@@ men seemed to be quite a fence , always paying deb@@ ts and spend money for things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rell gentle@@ men rede@@ emed their debt crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking boys , with a talent to advertise . &quot;
after the end of its use in the castle Rho@@ des is searching for other unique Write @-@ Experi@@ ences
he has taken a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ äm@@ än@@ mä@@ ki , the site of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which since then has been re@@ claimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ah , now I have to cope with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
launched campaign : more than 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the covering of the 301 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Hon@@ nef has launched its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep the logo and the slogan secret by Nelson Art@@ z until Thursday .
at the end of August there will be a celebration on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ ver@@ th as the culmin@@ ation of the campaign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too nice for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer chapel &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think this ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they write on their website released yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make it clear that some are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we believe that as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fers we are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it is said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate a single @-@ standing promise , one which gives the city an un@@ mistak@@ able unique feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally she stands in competition with other local communities .
the City of Bad Hon@@ nef is able to cost its new umbrella brand and the campaign for a mid @-@ five @-@ digit amount .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , Ankara advis@@ es the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) about retirement and promotions in the officers cor@@ ps .
so auch this week .
at first sight a normal procedure .
but nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as before , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
under the chair@@ manship of the He@@ ads of State , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers for Defence , Interior , Justice and Foreign Affairs also attended the meetings .
in this way , the civilians were in the Y@@ AS in the abundance .
the government moves the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff of Hul@@ usi ab@@ ides in office , but the commander of the army , the air@@ strikes and the nav@@ y were dismis@@ sed .
since the failed coup , President Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of 326 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of the ex@@ iled pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees Erdo@@ gan as the wire @-@ pul@@ ler of the coup attempt .
against 486 persons who were to be involved directly at the coup attempt , is negoti@@ ated in Ankara since that week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had designated the attempt to overthrow the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; God &apos;s gift &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he gives him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clean@@ se &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Erdo@@ gan has really gri@@ pped the army ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of February the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published an article titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ beh@@ agen in the Military Head@@ quarters &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the general Staff , there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the header ban for soldiers , wrote the newspaper .
the Grand Sl@@ aves in the army and the security forces are going on at any rate .
in mid @-@ July Erdo@@ gan sent by decree further 73@@ 95 workers , including 23@@ 03 polic@@ emen and 546 soldiers .
it seemed as though Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were formerly used as the masters of the country .
three times they put@@ ted on their role as guar@@ di@@ ans of the world@@ ly state order .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pressed the power of the military to step back , not least by calling on the reform proposals of the European Union .
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is systematically pursuing a Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; an officer named after the attempted coup attempt from persecution abroad A@@ sy@@ l , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; in a few years .
if that happens , such development could not leave the N@@ ato cold .
in any case , in the alliance after pur@@ ges , there is doubt about the deployment of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management structures and operational skills are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weak@@ ened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say N@@ ato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted by the media .
he plans to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 a year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do so by changing the way for citizens from other countries Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chains migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to renov@@ ate route for Rac@@ er@@ vice
again and again over the past few months over the future of the race climbing fleet has been disp@@ uted - now it is supposed to go very fast .
even before the end of the year , the track on which the tourist tra@@ der will drive will be built .
in order to ensure the long @-@ term future of the race ticket , according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work will start on the track this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order and renov@@ ate the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country adm@@ its to this especially for tourism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the State Secretary of State Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch .
from this sum , the country ski@@ ps 75 percent .
the contract , based on which the shuttle should also be ordered from the country in the future , will be voted today defini@@ tively , stated S@@ üh@@ l .
the ministry and the South Thuring@@ ian railway as operator are already in agreement with the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are tra@@ ded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of 11 years .
this means that the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle will be ordered by the end of December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a very popular rail link between Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g railway stations .
over the past few months , a pilot operation has been tested whether the route is used by many people to order them regularly in the future .
the track is also strongly b@@ ump@@ y in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should be worried
just as you thought it can not be more crazy in 2017 , a new report about the technological developments in the area of sex robots .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( foundation for responsible robot@@ ics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must start taking their as@@ cen@@ sion seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people are making fun of them , but companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key on the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sex dolls have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions which are reached by artificial intelligence .
the user can also adjust his robot according to his convic@@ tions and choose everything from the eye color of the robot via the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or the color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is more distur@@ bing since many robots have the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would make a step@@ ford woman progressive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
for example , the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there &apos;s the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot@@ ic developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed celeb@@ ri@@ ties such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which convey@@ s the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; advent@@ uro@@ us &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality , which is adapted to your personality as much as possible , &quot; war@@ med the True Compan@@ ion website .
so she likes what you like and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day she also has her m@@ oods - like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , fixed to conversation or she can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many distur@@ bing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female attributes , the all@@ usions to rape , when one goes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( said here : resist@@ ing ) Far@@ rah , distur@@ b one the most .
on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy compar@@ es with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toys .
their emergence and increasing refin@@ ement indicate something dar@@ ker and deeper in our culture , on a retreat from the ideal of gender equality into a desire for sex with submission as an optional enc@@ ore .
most men will of course not keep sex robots , and while the FR@@ R noted their increasing popularity , they still remain on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture .
but what le@@ aks out of the edge zones can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain over@@ l@@ apping that these highly developed sex robots are emerging in a time when the rights of women are threatened all over the world in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted women to be sex@@ ually ass@@ aul@@ ted .
the most horri@@ ble aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the dev@@ oured body and the engra@@ ved eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a big leap forward .
the aim behind these sex robots is to make a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( although with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , brought to the point when it comes to its &quot; personalities &quot; the robots are not real women .
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they have no medi@@ ation or a background story , nothing relating to independence or anything that could distur@@ b the fantasy of total subj@@ ection .
in other words , they are pleas@@ ing slaves .
or to express it in the Spe@@ aker of 2017 : ma@@ ids
Tr@@ umps large performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of common sense of human life
it has become a tr@@ ump @-@ wisdom of the Tr@@ ump @-@ era that the political spl@@ its that the U.S. elec@@ torate have pol@@ arized also have families in small format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving , in the USA , there were newspapers with advice on how to deal with the hor@@ ror of a group of people .
we are all told to make our filter bub@@ bles burst .
less noticed is the power of Tr@@ umps to bring families together .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ hand poet , who lives in Chicago and has long worked with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
it reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House Every@@ one knows it , including the Republi@@ can relationship with which she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and completely stran@@ gely on the same side .
to the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it is important to me that this also brings considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the issu@@ ing effect of his pres@@ idency has the strength to push us all to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; we refer to the sc@@ ary possibility that his cookies of one day will no longer be cast off . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , there is an even more difficult long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump Rep@@ ublic@@ ans norm@@ alise the right wing , which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards .
I find myself today from an active no@@ stal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the crazy - the dog on the car , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact appear to be a very mild criminal off@@ ence .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be only mentally healthy to qualify as im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the New York &apos;s car@@ ous@@ el &apos;s bikes , and the top three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caff@@ eine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are kn@@ ur@@ led and the animals turn out to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the per@@ spir@@ ited music convey@@ s this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the Top@@ ics pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage does not count - but a big round@@ about in northern London .
however , Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magic experience , as there are two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s and all have a great time .
if I could have evaluated the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it .
on the other hand , in this week I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I was able to pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my road it is the same , plus the option to balance the valu@@ ation with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to slow@@ ing down what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is needed .
the poor woman in the department store was exc@@ used , while I wear@@ ied the experience to reach my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us post@@ pon@@ ed with chest pain from prison to hospital
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year he was brought to the hospital because of the treatment of peti@@ tions , which he report@@ edly suffered from prison authorities in one case in his cell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us was convic@@ ted of murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors against a first death sentence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 by sh@@ aking her several times through a door of the toilet cabin at his house in Pret@@ oria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed he kept his girl@@ friend for a noc@@ turn@@ al inv@@ ader who hid himself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ eal from which they say they are too transparent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the National Prosec@@ ution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prosec@@ ution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the obj@@ ection could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is in danger of increasing his sentence to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer Arnold finds a remarkable egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berg schools , the Vier@@ t@@ kl@@ äs@@ sler from F@@ üssen and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen were released into the holidays and the secondary schools .
three of the students are going to attend school , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening , Mrs. Angel@@ ika S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen .
as a symbol of the om@@ ission , the 29 students of the four classes were elected by Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , a young eag@@ le growing at the ch@@ ick@@ n@@ erhof , but then released to freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the m@@ lower band performed a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Der Adler in Hüh@@ n@@ erhof auf &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bauer Arnold found a peculi@@ ar egg , and caused it to breed from his ch@@ ick@@ ens .
instead of a chicken k@@ ens , a small eag@@ le came out .
but the hope of making a chicken out of him smote himself , and the eag@@ le spread forth his wings on a high mountain , and sw@@ ayed .
after that the classes showed three and four in the Uni@@ versities of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young Go@@ ck@@ eln , who wor@@ e the cylinder to the bet .
the eag@@ le stands for integration , said trainer Angel@@ ika S@@ itte .
the young is indeed different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( ch@@ icks ) , but belong to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
she wished each quad@@ ru@@ iter that he feels accepted in his new school .
this was followed by a letter of thank@@ s@@ giving to the colleagues , the former school director Michael Müller , who always j@@ umps into teaching recep@@ tac@@ les and the parents &apos; representatives .
the Kü@@ ken@@ zeit is now over , explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher .
after two years of teaching , she was not leaving her students very much , because it had been a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the four @-@ t@@ ank@@ ers .
finally , all students left a song of summer time and holiday season .
with the children great joy broke out .
eight original containers have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were im@@ pris@@ oned for illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , c@@ ited from television .
on the morning of August 1 , in Si@@ th@@ onia , a group of illegal people were arrested by the police , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day , they were released , while an investigation is underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
the Greek authorities have shar@@ pen@@ ed control of the free camp and place anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , considerable financial pen@@ alties .
the controls will continue throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what the suffer@@ ers must know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must diesel drivers participate in the promotion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.@@ 3 million cars at the diesel summit .
they should improve the exhaust gas performance of cars in the emission classes Euro 5 and partially Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are exemp@@ ted from this .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from the ACE Auto Club Europa gives an assessment :
is the new action oblig@@ atory ?
no , the software updates tra@@ ded are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the oblig@@ atory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have Schumann software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their retro@@ fitting has ordered the Bundes@@ amt ( Kraft@@ fahrt @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation in the coming months , but still no exact date .
Daimler told us to write every person affected .
if an inspection is due anyway , this will be done in its context .
how long will the retro@@ fits take altogether ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; S@@ met@@ an@@ in says .
the dependence on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen , voluntarily the car manufacturers do not act on the subject of the environment until now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the change@@ over itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time consuming can be to get an appointment .
what do drivers do , who do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE tells us to wait .
pres@@ um@@ ably foreign manufacturers would subsequently withdraw , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now threat@@ ens a massive price deteri@@ oration of Euro @-@ 4 cars ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ACE is afraid of that .
but even in the regions where driving pro@@ hi@@ bitions are threatening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in rural areas there is no loss of value for older diesel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ACE advis@@ es to wait with a sale .
ll Cool J awarded Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to become political .
one of the lau@@ re@@ ates does not want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first r@@ apper to get one of the cov@@ eted awards by the renowned Kennedy Center .
as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , this year also includes singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) .
the awards will be handed over at the beginning of December .
traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will hold a reception and join the award together with his wife Mel@@ ania .
the winner of the award winner with progressive TV shows already announced Le@@ ar to ref@@ rain from taking part in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to neg@@ lect the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ving them of the means - and that bur@@ dens me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump to make her view clear .
the Kennedy @-@ Center , named after the former president John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital .
previous award winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De N@@ iro , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city life worth
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ lach &apos;s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes into pension next year .
the place has already been written - but suitable applicants are rare .
for 31 years W@@ acker is the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
and the work still makes him great fun , as he convey@@ s in the press conference .
he reports of varied , but also challenging tasks waiting for his success@@ ors .
at the same time , it mir@@ ac@@ ul@@ ously aston@@ ishes him that no application has fulfilled the requirements profile so far .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the next possible time .
this way - considering the regular periods of notice - should still be enough time for a preparation .
since Has@@ lach works for the administrative community as the Lower Building Law Authority , the applicant must assign corresponding certificates .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if it would no longer be able to fill it , the citizens would have to travel to Off@@ enburg .
but the clos@@ eness to the city and itself is important to him , says W@@ acker , who reports about a good working climate and good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some significant projects have gathered to look back on the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city life worthy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the building and its staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Lower Ho@@ ops parking lot are aimed .
the zig@@ z@@ ag bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium renovation is still a topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter only will be@@ ech with about 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we make it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker appreci@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my success@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; design &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is available for a master builder of large playing room . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Has@@ lach &apos;s own farm and gar@@ dener can react quite flexibly to many .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; since the old town stands as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have an eye for what rein@@ forces &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when new buildings are approved , stres@@ ses the separ@@ ating Stadt@@ bau@@ meister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister is carrying high responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is the builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end everything is running over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in attendance and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been there for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also that his successor stays long , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who wants to be really identified and would like to stay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city .
anyone who wants to inher@@ it Roland W@@ acker should have a completed course of studies as a graduate engineer or a bach@@ el@@ or &apos;s degree in architecture and have good knowledge in the fields of structural and construction law .
the Municipal Building Office under@@ lies Hoch@@ - und Tief@@ bau , Bau@@ leit@@ planung , Gr@@ under@@ wer@@ b@@ san@@ aan , Municip@@ ality of Municipal Auth@@ orities , Municipal Court with Bau@@ hof and Stadt@@ g@@ är@@ t@@ ner@@ ei , as well as the Lower Building Law Authority , including monuments conservation .
bike thrown on pi@@ pel@@ ines : road closed
according to the police , the previously unknown perpet@@ rat@@ ors had thrown the blue bike from the railway track crossing in the area of Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the leader@@ ships .
these were damaged so heavily that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators walk out of two male offen@@ ders and look for them since the night hours .
near the crime scene a rose sco@@ oter and a bicycle driver were watched by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond the empire of Lausanne , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch on AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rat@@ ors or the perpet@@ rat@@ ors would have brought themselves into great danger and je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the train traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locom@@ otive and the system as well as the delay @-@ drive and the cost of transport replacement goods , the rail@@ ways customers could also get to the perpet@@ rat@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; overall , from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum , the spokes@@ man said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the southern railway line could be guided without disabilities .
just under ten passenger trains had dropped Friday mor@@ nings , two of them watched the long @-@ distance traffic .
freight trains did not fall out , but they had bel@@ ated .
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
ins@@ ul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red me@@ ats , dairy products and chocolate could help rel@@ ieve IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your diges@@ tive system .
but a new study says exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el diseases .
the incur@@ able state in the USA affects approximately 1.3 million and 300@@ ,000 in the United States , causes stomach ul@@ c@@ ages and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ ring or bloody di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme ti@@ red@@ ness .
while those affected normally avoid eating meat and dairy products to alle@@ vi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an contributes to the development of immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant gut .
the senior researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells pat@@ rol in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in food do not penet@@ rate into the body .
cells capable of dis@@ solving inflamm@@ ations are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without dam@@ aging sensitive tissue .
if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
experiments have been established that a kind of tolerance stimul@@ ating immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their bo@@ wels .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an - one of the building blocks of proteins - to dis@@ solve the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an the mice had in their diet , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
it suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet that is rich in tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an is more toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bow@@ el @-@ intestinal inflammation , if the same system also affects people .
the post @-@ doctoral candidate Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same trunk , which was separated , but had not been separated .
it pres@@ umed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ om@@ es of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species were found that were present in mice with the immune cells , but without them missing in mice .
mice were raised in a ster@@ ile environment so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how bacteria appeared on the immune system , the researchers led the researchers of L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ri@@ pe immune cells that were isolated by the mice .
the immune cells developed to the tolerance @-@ enhancing cells .
when the active component was cle@@ ans@@ ed from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an metabolism , known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an in the feed of mice , the number of cells increased by approximately 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an explained that people have the same toler@@ ant @-@ toler@@ ant cells like mice , and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our g@@ astro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote because these cells control inflamm@@ ations on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; potentially high tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an extension of this population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho thinks Manchester United has committed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; geni@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at Manchester United he signed a &quot; geni@@ us &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million pound signing of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday , and impressed in the bracket role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira pre@@ mar@@ ched to Belgrade .
however , M@@ atic was excluded from the Pre@@ par@@ ung @-@ Asia @-@ tour of the blues and made only 45 minutes , what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho added that he had to improve before the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a geni@@ us in the way he thinks - thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready earlier than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in Avi@@ va Stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted three more engag@@ ements , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four prime obligations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get three out of four , thanks to the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have given great difficulty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bo@@ eing &quot; m@@ alt &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the American aircraft manufacturer Bo@@ eing painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pil@@ ots fle@@ w from Seattle in Washington State U.S. , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state Michigan and moved in the shape of a Dream@@ liner over the U.S. , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the shape of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was an endurance test for new engines .
Bo@@ eing had previously made such advertisement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Bo@@ eing logo was painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new depth for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turns out , when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , social @-@ democratic PM @-@ Pres@@ idents were always looking for Berlin with a certain concern .
only there was no interference from the central party , but no head@@ winds from the League - that was the most important wish of the elec@@ toral fighters .
since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally .
since then , the members of the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus , with a growing hor@@ ror , observe the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capit@@ als .
what Mr Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described with head@@ winds in the approach .
there were lows of depth .
and one by one .
after the surprising ending of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against coalition of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows once again : red @-@ green can simply not be able to rule reliably , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber on the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprising fraction of a green de@@ pu@@ te has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the election , its red @-@ green coalition thus lost its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green Belt Managing Director Michael Kell@@ ner has called on the sec@@ lu@@ y lower Sax@@ on Green MPs El@@ ke T@@ westen to give back their mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the transition to CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the vot@@ er &apos;s will . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen must immediately return her mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the German Federal Minister and Intern@@ ship Manager of the Green Board Network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; si@@ gh@@ s a SPD elec@@ toral figh@@ ter than on Friday mor@@ nings the new job message reaches the central party headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is standing after the res@@ ign@@ ation of the green de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U without any government majority .
it is the pro@@ visional culmin@@ ation of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD leaders .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the mis@@ ery began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , more not , cal@@ med the comrades at that time .
after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia everything will be different .
this was the case - and everything got much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the mar@@ bles , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te transformed the party smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; te@@ di@@ ous r@@ app@@ y the comrades in the weeks afterwards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then , when they had just had new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg came .
and with him the next beat came .
Mayor Olaf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD leader , lost his Nim@@ bus that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbe Philharmonic , while his town burned .
and because in the crisis communications he made quite everything wrong , what one can do wrong .
since then Sch@@ olz has been fighting for his political survival .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the Volkswagen ab@@ at@@ ement and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in criticism since a long time .
mi@@ ese survey values came .
nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of this , Wei@@ l tried to set acc@@ ents in the course of the past weeks .
the am@@ bition of the earlier mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin remained un@@ conce@@ aled in the environment of Martin Schulz .
they let him grant him , as they spoke of Wei@@ l a stabili@@ zation of the party .
now the exact opposite might occur .
in doing so , Wei@@ l is not responsible for the party @-@ internal compul@@ sion of the lower @-@ Sax@@ on nature .
and Schulz did not at all .
from time to time the comrades try to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here , above all , to the sec@@ lu@@ ded Par@@ li@@ ament@@ ary in the Sou@@ thwest .
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ westen puts her own care@@ ers on the interests of everyone else , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the SPD Par@@ li@@ ament@@ ary faction , the German editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
Mrs. T@@ westen was not elected as a direct candidate for its person , but on the country list of the lower @-@ Sax@@ on Green Party , so the Lower Saxony member continued .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ li@@ ament@@ ary faction , compl@@ ains with a &quot; un@@ democratic man@@ eu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vot@@ er four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l as prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a top candidate into the federal election , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ ties dist@@ orts the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he asked to clarify the backgrounds .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further commitments from the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
funding grants for local nucle@@ us III
who wants to rehabil@@ itate the house in the years can soon get support from the country .
informed Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of ST@@ EG Urban Development on Wednesday in sensitivity .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler again gave a look back to what happened so far .
since 1991 there has been in sensi@@ ti@@ zing rehabilitation areas .
at that time , in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - it is important to foster interior development , not only to open up new construction sites . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on April 4 , the Government President Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a rehabilitation area III .
the total funding amount is 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which 500 000 euros come from the country , the rest from the community .
how does a rehabilitation area develop ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; one will continue to investigate so in@@ dler where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role in rehabil@@ it@@ ating whether there is interest in the planned area .
if necessary , the regional boundaries could then also be post@@ pon@@ ed again .
on Wednesday evening , the ST@@ EG represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the Bund @-@ Länder @-@ Programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the program is the re@@ vit@@ alization of inner cities , improving the living and working conditions , and the maintenance and expansion of the infrastructure .
the measures would be carried out obj@@ ectively , i.e. , per plot .
the refur@@ bish@@ ment area would then finally be set as a stat@@ ute .
the ir@@ rig@@ ation period for funding runs from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026 .
until September this year , however , the survey would only be carried out once , in the context of those involved in the rehabilitation field to fill out a questionn@@ aire .
in November or December , the order intake will take place in order to begin with the renovation next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently declared that every Commun@@ e must carry out the said preliminary examinations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about evaluating the urban@@ istic gri@@ ev@@ ances and deciding when to rehabil@@ itate and to what extent .
for the respective property there will be also a re@@ mark in the land register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again and take a picture of the situation , promised her . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he emphas@@ ised that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants .
this is why there will be questionn@@ aires that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled until after the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionn@@ aire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and land bow &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which , among other things , it is about the structural condition and the restructuring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the gray questionn@@ aire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and housing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; information about size , division and inhabit@@ ant of a living room can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Operating System &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be filled out if business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , to be aware , Got@@ zel pointed out that a completed questionn@@ aire is not at the same time an application for funding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , new construction measures are not eligible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ in@@ dler also emphasized that the distribution of the subsidies after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - who first comes , ad@@ mon@@ ishes first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there cannot be any funding for later &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reser@@ ving &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local nucle@@ us II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a refur@@ bish@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or sets itself a micro@@ chip to come into house and car with a hand movement
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country , equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his front door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ b and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consultant in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the im@@ plant procedure is carried out according to medical standards .
the technology resem@@ bles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now installed both at home and at his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the expenses of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ er thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a helicop@@ ter to the South La@@ wn for an event , which highlights American manufacturing last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military information provided to the TIME Magazine up to $ 24,@@ 000 .
the Green white Sik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Navy One , when the President is on board , was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officers of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
the helicop@@ ter made in Connec@@ tic@@ ut was issued next to a yacht of Ma@@ ine , a fire fighting car from Wis@@ cons@@ in and a Gabel@@ stapler from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the White House &apos;s military office requested the presence of helicop@@ ter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fr@@ ago , barely 36 hours before the helicop@@ ter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the Chron@@ icle of Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for operation of the helicop@@ ter .
&quot; I only wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his su@@ peri@@ ors , the Deputy Nav@@ al Committee for Avi@@ ation .
the news showed that the helicop@@ ter arrived at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning and stayed until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew would be required for the return flight .
the original flight crew was during the event during the helicop@@ ter while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time .
from the records provided by TIME , it was not clear whether a second flight was ultimately required .
the H@@ atch Act pro@@ hi@@ bits federal states to use state property for political purposes .
dat@@ as@@ ets indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could inj@@ ure the appointment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the commander wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered the dep@@ uty commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated as an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an imp@@ etus to the reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate and he propag@@ ated the efforts to ins@@ ulate the government regulations .
the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon from politically advantageous purposes .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo @-@ OP is unusual .
Tr@@ ump carried out an investigation in February when the presidential flight att@@ ested against the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , Tax@@ i@@ services , and his Twitter account is full of messages compl@@ aining about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is enth@@ r@@ alled by the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the dep@@ uty secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently perform training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area to offset the U.S. president at the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 Summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 conducted 58 exercises in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted for the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
helicop@@ ter units also fle@@ w 11 hours on that day for &quot; non @-@ pres@@ idency support missions . &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers over@@ took the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man from Sik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved to exhibit the helicop@@ ter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not hold budget records for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D equipment set for V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour .
record of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft than 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Cor@@ ps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicop@@ ter lie far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates for refund rates is most mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in annual funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the funds for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but also take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract completion .
at that time the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , def@@ ended the use of helicop@@ ter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things this week , which are made in America , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I know Sik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it .
and I think most Americans are all proud of helicop@@ ters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , it is appropriate to highlight this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear if Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting with the helicop@@ ter when he entered his tour through the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire fighting car .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Sik@@ or@@ sky and jo@@ king with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Sik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss before tri@@ cky task
leader of the second Tennis @-@ Bundes@@ liga k@@ icks off at the Tab@@ ell@@ end@@ amm Su@@ kk@@ dorf SV .
the TC Blau @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss will take place tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the Tab@@ ell@@ end@@ amm Su@@ kk@@ dorfer SV .
despite the five games there is still flaw@@ less balance , the leader of the Second Tennis @-@ Bundes@@ liga has got the sense of reality .
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent at any rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that is always in a quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially on the post@@ erior positions I find the team very good . &quot;
for class and stability at Su@@ kk@@ dorfer SV , the imports from the high North are mainly concerned .
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to stak@@ es in the Davis Cup .
and they are also strong in double , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a look at Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas Bj@@ er@@ reh@@ u ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be as always difficult for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good portion of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high north is convenient .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
while at the moment the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella does not succeed in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ game , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) tournament will play in the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec Fest ( Czech Republic ) for its first use this season .
yesterday with the white rus@@ sen An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ sky , the previously un@@ defeated Chil@@ ene Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was on the ball at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el .
he should be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgi@@ ans Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two vic@@ tories last Sunday against the club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could also return to the team again .
it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hung@@ arians who was still number one of the Junior World R@@ ank@@ ings in January 2016 , someone from the Train@@ erst@@ ab um Mari@@ us Z@@ ay fills the cad@@ res .
how America can harm the O@@ MV
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really happy Donald Tr@@ ump does not , when he put his signature under the law to shar@@ pen@@ ing sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to leave the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Congress adopted a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming against the US initiative .
after all , the draft plans to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russi@@ ans to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines in the EU .
since then investors are al@@ armed by local O@@ MV who jointly with other European companies have co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea line Nord Stream 2 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dro@@ h@@ k@@ uli@@ sse is huge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , it is too early for an under@@ estim@@ ation of the consequences , so the official statement of the oil corporation .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump has to raise the sanctions by executive order for life .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looked at which the Group could defend and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Trailer : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is cent@@ red in the series of Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second squ@@ ad@@ ron of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar killer un@@ vei@@ ls , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x has not been over for a long time .
the seasons three and four were already confirmed by streaming service , the first got their first trailer and showed the latest bu@@ cks of the show .
with the third season the DE@@ A has focused its attention on the rich@@ est organization of the world &apos;s drug traff@@ icking : the Cal@@ i @-@ Kart@@ ell .
led by four powerful states , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une @-@ 500 @-@ Company &quot; with more government bri@@ ber@@ y and violent actions .
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Alc@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , Pach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e SAN@@ T@@ AC@@ RU@@ Z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York .
in the newly published trailer Pedro Pascal returns to Javier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement agencies to support the war against drugs .
other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Sil@@ vest@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro .
the third season of Nar@@ cos will start on September 1st .
back@@ wards : the city introduces 46 kitchen aids
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch table again .
with firm contact partners for the children and an assignment to the team .
the clock has come back in the city &apos;s day@@ care centres .
on 1 September the city of Kre@@ feld will reg@@ ain the food supply in the urban kinder@@ garten establishments ( Kit@@ as ) again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , assistant director in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jugend@@ hilfe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; department , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooked will continue to be cooked outside : a cat@@ erer under@@ takes this task and provides fresh Gek@@ o@@ chtes .
the city operates in the Kre@@ felder area 46 children day care centres , in 44 children receive a hot meal at lun@@ ch@@ time .
last year , 28@@ 00 children were sitting at the tables and the need grows constantly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who are looked after 45 week@@ hours in the K@@ ita have lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour care if children stay until 2 pm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time forces have kitchen service from 1st September : they warm up the delivered food , supplement them to salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tion@@ ate the meal individually , give the food out , clean , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees are tied to a K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as 7 @-@ group establishments - decides about the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen assist@@ ants are now firmly part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the k@@ ite line to implement ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because it &apos;s also about healthy eating and cooking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children should help prepare the food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct link between the ch@@ uck &apos;s force to the team is useful .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for children .
pur@@ ging of the k@@ ita rooms - up to now also the task of the kitchen ju@@ ices - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future .
this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen also has the charm that it has shown in the cost comparison between self @-@ governing and foreign assign@@ ments for the city as the most economical point of view , is it from the press office .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are rest@@ art@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours do not fall so strongly with around 750 people in education , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nicholas Hay@@ som , reig@@ ning leader of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women will be in the provinces in the provinces . three women de@@ code for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered vot@@ ers are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elections can only be truly representative and credi@@ ble when women participate fully and be involved in all parts of the election process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and presidential elections take place on April 5 .
the Tali@@ ban has published threats against an election process , which coinci@@ des with the transition from international combat operations to an advisory role .
this year , the elections for the first time will take power peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ som said , a strong role for women will intensi@@ fy the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an independent Ele@@ ction Commission reports that 1.2 million women were registered by a total registered 3.@@ 6 million vot@@ ers .

G@@ MB concerns about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glas@@ gow
a union would like to become a trade union with managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie over the long @-@ term commitment to production in their factory in Glas@@ gow .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company out@@ weigh the future of investments at T@@ oll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the work , which is adjacent to other products hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich tea bis@@ cu@@ its .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pl@@ adi@@ s said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first experienced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the company &apos;s shop manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s call for &quot; concerns to express that financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines is not promoted . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , concerns our members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generations of families have worked here and the workers focus strongly on the local community and the Glas@@ gow metrop@@ olitan area , an important pillar for decent jobs in an area of high unemployment and social dis@@ advantage .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glas@@ gow is urg@@ ently needed a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ person from Pl@@ adi@@ s said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Fili@@ all@@ eiter at T@@ oll@@ cross received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday and the company will react directly to this because we value the continuous commitment with employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago , we had a regular meeting with staff and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed openly .
we discussed with the employees that we , like all companies active in an extremely competitive and un@@ safe economic climate , are constantly checking our business - and that applies to all our business units and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross location , particularly in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility fully and completely . if our operations change at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the Barcelona leave Barcelona in front of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?

Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main won &apos;t ref@@ rain from N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s persecution after having issued an offer of £ 189 million to dis@@ solve its release cl@@ ause , but did they war@@ n Barcelona three years ago ?
the sens@@ ational approach has hal@@ ted the transfer window in the summer , as the League 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous mark , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds .
after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paid professional ath@@ l@@ ete in the world . PSG offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is angry about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced its way out , although a source close to the Catal@@ ans Board insi@@ sts that the club has always given its best to take care of him since his arrival in Santos in 2013 .
but was the football world been warned against this prospect for three years ago ?
as Manchester City &apos;s 2014 interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign up one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish association at the beginning of this summer expressed interest in the PSG @-@ Mittel@@ feld player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
PSG made it clear that it would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .
sco@@ ot@@ ers revers@@ ed and damaged
in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown perpet@@ r@@ ator has picked up a sco@@ oter in the royal fields street in front of the estate number 30 and so on the fair@@ ing of the vehicle &apos;s property damage caused by more than 200 euros .
police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , phone 07@@ 422 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , ask for advice .
the police witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
because a car encountered it in its lane , the driver had to switch to a VW Tour@@ an and touched the guide schedule .
on Thursday evening the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um was on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in direction to Le@@ ese .
in the area of the rel@@ ocation of Stol@@ zen@@ au a passenger car met him in front of him so that he had to switch to the right .
the Tour@@ an rider touched the gui@@ deline .
property damage was made on the passenger car .
the driver of the coming passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ hau@@ led a truck and continued his trip without wor@@ rying about the traffic accident .
according to the accident damaged it can be good that the Mer@@ ced@@ es@@ driver had not noticed the accident at all .
the police now ask witnesses of the incident , as well as the driver of the perpet@@ r@@ ator , to contact the commis@@ s@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au , tel . 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 .
interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &apos;s Report reli@@ eves Pope Bro@@ ther Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &apos;s report on the abuse of abuse is reli@@ eved by Pope Bro@@ ther Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and hist@@ orian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse @-@ sc@@ andal in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussion .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ person for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; explained after publication in front of the German press agency , he was expecting an ap@@ ology from the former Regen@@ s@@ burger bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as from the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI .
it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ issions or their then false assessment of the events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , on the other hand , cri@@ tici@@ zed the fact that in the reporting of violence at Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , it is measured with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; double standards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubt that it would have to be &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; that would have to be pun@@ ished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of medi@@ al manipulation , &quot; the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , hist@@ orian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hab@@ it of design@@ ating the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepar@@ es public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Für@@ sti@@ n Gl@@ oria from Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is also said in the interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; one likes to go to the church and that is a fixed feeding . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that in her youth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; b@@ lows have been a completely normal educational tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be done with nau@@ gh@@ ty children as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they found it un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s standards to previous decades , because the world has changed .
in connection with reports on the abuse of abuse , Pope Bro@@ ther Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
completely un@@ ju@@ stly , author and hist@@ orian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote the mem@@ or@@ and@@ um &quot; My Bro@@ ther of the Pope &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly stands in the 440 @-@ page report commissioned by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg with the En@@ lighten@@ ment appointed attor@@ ney Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 547 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sex@@ ually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the final report , it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , the fact that Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. was used in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence .
especially with high emoti@@ on@@ ality , the punishment for the students could also be more severe .
nevertheless , contrary to numerous other accus@@ ations , many victims den@@ ounced the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even have positive memories of him in many cases . &quot;
in an interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal in the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger seems reli@@ eved of his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inci@@ dents of Viol@@ ence of Viol@@ ence at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; gives a contradic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one , many students empha@@ size his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , he also appears as a cholesterol and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which became tan@@ gible for the gre@@ ener when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz produced no top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ographer ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is present at all .
he is just once dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly acqu@@ itted by every sus@@ pic@@ ion of complic@@ ity or co @-@ workers in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
violent exc@@ esses at the pre @-@ school also happened outside his sphere of influence .
at best , one can repro@@ ach him , to learn from it too late , or have not taken initial indications seriously enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gymn@@ asi@@ um , on which he worked , was felt as literally - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; salvation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also gives a very excellent certificate , &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who provided the boys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cu@@ its and bon@@ b@@ ons and &quot; always enc@@ amped &quot; by children . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ains about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emoti@@ on@@ ality , which also led to wi@@ dow@@ ns .
the fact that he didn &apos;t just kne@@ el with chairs and threw the keys on the floor , but also over@@ laid ears and too nau@@ gh@@ ty guys on the hair or ears , he himself already gave years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
for his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the frag@@ ile period , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents as well as teachers .
do you know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think each of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a sec@@ ular school , a state school .
compared to what is actually going on in this report , namely the horri@@ ble sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses at the pre @-@ school , the liber@@ ally bag@@ at@@ elles .
one wonders whether it &apos;s not more about his famili@@ arity and role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just fallen on him .
at the Bavarian pop@@ e many people who never understood him are still busy .
but the truth is : the report is reli@@ eved by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media , in connection with the report , much about the issue of abuse happened with the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger gro@@ unded in the final report also some involvement or co @-@ worker with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : quite clearly no .
none of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults have claimed to have entrusted himself to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said an affected behalf for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing was very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in educ@@ ating sexual abuse has been and is , however , that most victims are silent .
if they do not even entr@@ ust themselves to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir director , who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors professionally .
how do the Scr@@ ab@@ sc@@ ab students R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a ques@@ tioned student put it like this : &quot; concerning sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely insight and could have stopped the respective perpet@@ r@@ ator .
I think it ... also for really absurd to assume that it was imp@@ uted to him ... boys intr@@ usive or clear@@ er or even more opened than against their parents , dormit@@ ory managers , trust teachers , etc .
that one talks to him about sex ... is un@@ th@@ ink@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report conclu@@ des with the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the student and / or their environment entrusted to him in advance could not be confirmed within the framework of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore acqu@@ itted of all co @-@ workers .
thus he cannot be accused of being prevented or brought to an ad .
therefore , there is no reason to associate its good name with these conf@@ lic@@ ting crimes , as it has unfortunately occurred in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media a lot of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violent exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had to be read with the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was present in the report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Look Out &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this repro@@ ach ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that everything was mixed in the reporting and bl@@ ended up to a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the midst of dr@@ in , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is exactly the abuse of the report .
there is , namely , clean@@ ly separated : between the pre @-@ school and the Gymnasium of Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses as well as , let &apos;s say , other alle@@ g@@ ations .
in addition , the report covers inci@@ dents from the time since 1945 , so also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral director of the cathedral @-@ cats .
the whole terrible test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were quite timi@@ d and mal@@ portra@@ yed and suffered , occurred all at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have prev@@ ailed .
but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys first to face when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on that was , as most witnesses stress , the theme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; primary school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab@@ oo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; states .
what was different on the school gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was a certain discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger where the report conclu@@ des that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims estimated the overall humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , at most , the repro@@ ach remains to be looked away .
despite all efforts , the report was able to define only two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school in which he was not working and responsible , ( as the witness ) did not want to hear , and then until 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently close the ears ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the school gymn@@ asi@@ um , which even reproduced the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he pointed out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pre @-@ school , the punishment would continue to be practic@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
already in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent action .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was , as a test , had long been b@@ anned in Bavaria as well .
before that they occurred in a legal grey area , as each of us still knows .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was also hard to estimate for him where those affected might be exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but one cannot say that he has always looked away .
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 the j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal penalty of schools was officially aboli@@ shed in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is said yes , it was un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical standards at that time .
how do you see that ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we histori@@ ans talk about the &quot; sn@@ are of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; meaning the danger of evaluating past moral standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the princ@@ ess has already right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this , of course , does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ hor@@ red at all times , and not for what has been v@@ om@@ ited in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s se@@ abed , which goes far beyond the usual .
this is all very aw@@ ful and I am glad that it will finally be re@@ worked .
but at the same time I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ishing , thus creating ear fig@@ s and the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then b@@ anned , he also strictly adher@@ ed to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what picture of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Regen@@ s@@ burger Zeit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has reproduced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Bro@@ ther of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the topic test penalty also come to speech ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct X@@ VI@@ . , tells from his perspective that the cathedral @-@ cats played only a side @-@ role .
nevertheless , I did not at all refuse to lead a strict reg@@ iment there .
but even this must be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without claiming un@@ conditional discipline , it would hardly be possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ g from the until then rather nation@@ ally known Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the United States ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cu@@ its and bon@@ b@@ ons alone , you don &apos;t have a big singer and any success , right in which field , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ over@@ coming .
what kind of people did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in talks about her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and experienced again and again as wonderful , hum@@ orous , gr@@ atuit@@ ous , deeply believing and heart@@ felt people from which one can &apos;t imagine that he could do something just one fly .
I am regular with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen still today , 23 years after his em@@ eri@@ ti@@ zation , regularly contact him , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family .
those who do not forgive him until now that he was once severe to them , are thus clearly in the minority .
today , most of the Dom@@ estic cats are grateful to him for enrich@@ ing their lives and bringing them to the world of music .
and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , sure , that may be - but still a lov@@ able person who has to look up today and ad@@ ore it down@@ right .
and please , once again quite clear : all that you submit to it are educational methods that were on the agenda back then .
we can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man , just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ eg@@ o@@ at .
there is the evil intention behind it , only too obvious .
for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eves him .
now the u@@ prising would have a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has earned great mer@@ its and without the exception of Bavaria and perhaps Germany nobody would know the Dom@@ estic Swe@@ des , finally in peace .
