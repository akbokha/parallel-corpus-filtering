<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt, where young people should meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A pit chapel, where now it is dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Kleingärtner are cultivating the former cause of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich is promoting exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It annoys when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">That knows everyone who had to get upset because the car-navigation system showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportals Bayern of the State Government, are anything but up-to-date - but very informative.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed since the 19th century in the area of the Munich Merkur area.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a flickering carpet, which one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the large picture postcard, detailed maps, so-called urpositionsblätter, were incorporated for cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bayerische Vermessungsverwaltung between 1810 and 1864.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army captain occupied Bavaria since spring 1800 during the Second Coalition War in Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville of February 9, 1801, there were today's neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph drove the project further, founded the" "" "Topographic Bureau" "" "- and therefore the Bayerische Vermessungsverwaltung." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The collection for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like to find all the others on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is subcutling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was founded 21 years after the card was created, so 1877, as a district in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, underground is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Lower Saxony were concentrated around 1856 along the present Plinganserstraße, which was named after George Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, you can see nothing but fields - at first sight: in the case of a zooming, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered plots from the so-called "original photograph," from which the basic tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small plots today no longer prove to farmers - but small farmers of the plant" "" "Land in Sonne" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 scene of the Oktoberfest, was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "in the" "" "Urpositionsblatt" "" "in the area of today's district, Au-Haidhausen is not only reading the street name" "" "at Gasteig" "" "or" "" "Auf der Lüften" "" "- but also in big letters" "" "Irren Anstalt" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here on the Auerfeldstraße one once locked people with madness.</seg>
<seg id="33">There in 1858 / 59 the Münchner Kreis-Irrenanstalt "was created" Auf der Auer Ventilation. "</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed up the institution - that psychiatrist, who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chains of so-called" "" "Irish" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he instructed the staff to apply force against the inmates, "says Hermann Wilhelm, director of the Museum Haidhausen, who worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients there was first room, later it was expanded to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was not sufficient - the reason for the construction of the circular sirens in the year 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost is located, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists.</seg>
<seg id="40">On the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now meet at the Salesianum in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order warped the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training facilities.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football field of the TSV München Ost, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children house "Casa Don Bosco" was erected in an architectural approach to the original building of the Irrenstrasse, which was destroyed during the Second World War in bombing raids.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was built around 1856 as" "" "main square" "", "the shopping road was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich too.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies broke out many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a pit chapel from the Middle Ages were once stood at the Marienhof, where these days were the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the sliders, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil rights group publishes Reisewarnung for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Farmers has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "the NAACP Travel Advisory for the Federal State Missouri, which will take effect until 28 August 2017, calls for afro-american travellers, visitors and Missourians to take special attention to travel through the state, as a number of questionable, racial-based incidents occur throughout the country and are listed here," "" "says the group." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it difficult for people to win discrimination, as well as the prosecuting authorities of the state who disproportionately aim at minorities, the group called to issue the Reisewn, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "you have violations of civil rights that people pass." ""</seg>

<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such incidence that we have not yet heard." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the US.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group quoted incidents such as racist crime against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no petrol during the trip and was taken in custody by the Missouri police without being accused of crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recent report by the Missouri general public prosecutor's office in which black motorists will be held 75 percent more common than white.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be willing to accept deposits or let relatives know they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the hate crime report of FBI, which classifies the state with regard to the number of such violations in the 16th position of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The Reisewarnung is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Prior to that, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued rice prints for Texas and Arizona after the States adopted immigration laws to arrest people for immigration violations, which will contribute to further race-profiling according to ACLU's opinion.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel sewage is usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>

<seg id="70">In the Legionenhof of the family Schwendemann met representatives of the fishermen's bacher CDU place together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann first granted insight into his farm in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and housed in five apartments Feriengäste.</seg>

<seg id="80">Farmers need to be supported at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare.</seg>

<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have are the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their operation," "" "stressed the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">"" "" "" "farmers are often criticized because of their support." ""</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced.</seg>
<seg id="85">The open-open area amounts to 40 hectares, which may not be forested until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">The total cost of EUR 71 500 was funded by half over the leader, a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers had 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"" "" "" "the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," "" "stated Schwendemann." ""</seg>

<seg id="91">The Landscape Centre (LPR) of Baden-Württemberg enables state-of-the-art production of electric fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to maintain the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The prerequisite is the presence of a subsidy set by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the enclosure must not be towed (slope above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the reforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">The application of eight participants with 24 parcels, which would like to build fence nearly 16 kilometres of fence, is currently running for the Fisherbach's Weidezaunprojekt 2018.</seg>
<seg id="96">The open-up area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs lie at more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fira square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN on the proposals of the president to drastically restrict the legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boaters and liberty imitators would have voiced him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he attacked her meaning, and in particular the importance she was written as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to his base.</seg>
<seg id="105">As Miller Acosta complained: "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem you refer to is later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is objectively correct, but as he formulated it himself, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporaneous response to the vibrating words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your trash, your poor, / your afflicted masses who longing to breathe freely, / the poor waste of your rich shores."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "falling down" "" "on our screens was better to see." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people were not welcome in the US.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural conflict: it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends, who used to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they did a highly political act.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was to show the connections between French and American republicanism, portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a portrayed classical portrayal.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no more abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a very different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection between the poem and the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great cry of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued that the Statue of Liberty was not inviting anyone but rather an early neo-conservative, bringing the American flame into the reclaimed world: "Lady Liberty goes forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch should not enlighten the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Pretty unusual, Limbaugh encountered something here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite a matter of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted, elusive, but hopeful people after long and often horrible journeys on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the most truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not enlighten the way, but the hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict observance of the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as primary means to connect with his voters and to debue his hair-less head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">That is why the blockade of people coming to the Governor's side - which is a public forum, is considered officially and by employees who are paid by public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>

<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of castor or spammers or hasserted people who swing online the whip.</seg>

<seg id="465">Tumbling celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius</seg>
<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, on the old cemetery-area in Tumlingen on Sunday, 16th July, at 4.30 pm a serenade was invited.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius-site is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">The visitors of the sixth benefit serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and supporters of Tumours to their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasises: "it is a unique village gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Württembergischen Urkundenbuch: Graf Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church of Tumlingen and the Vogtei "to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the document, on the Tumlinger Mountain, apart from the former parish church, there was also a delightful court to which the Church or the patronage was right and not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id="473">So people also lived there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As described in the description of the Upper Freudenstadt of 1858, was next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which today is still recognizable in the townscape of Tumbling, the "Berg" the third, the splendid settlement nucleus of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps dating back to the year 1600 underpin these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">"" "the" "" "patronage" "" "was born from the early medieval church right." ""</seg>
<seg id="477">A Lord who built a church and occupied with a pastor remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Associated with this was the right to use a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The Greater of the two shattered at Christmas in 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell rang for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed over later during the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years War (1616 to 1648) the windows were inserted and the bell peppers were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was waterproof.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They turned out the pulpit and churchyard chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remains of the church threatened to crash in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869, the Hilarius cemetery served as last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilariuskirche abandoned.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's eight in 1834, a storm outdivided the church tower and the half crashed.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower remaining today was preserved as a witness of the 750 years old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are cultivating the "creative retirees" as successor of Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">As organiser, the friends and promoters invite the tumulgens on Sunday, July 16th, to the sixth serenade to the old cemetery of St. Hilariuskapelle.</seg>
<seg id="495">It is designed by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with words by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Hartmut ROMANN says the closing word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program will start at 4: 30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 3.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="499">To the end of the serenade a trunk is held in front of the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="500">"" "" "" "enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest," "" "the organizers put out the fantastic view." ""</seg>
<seg id="501">The serenade occurs only in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organizers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius-plant, which is of importance for tumbling and hearing welding.</seg>

<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette no wind turbines could have been approved because at the time in Viersen only at the city border to Schwalmtal existed a wind power concentration zone.</seg>
<seg id="509">Within this concentration zone construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city.</seg>

<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans to build four each 200 metres high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="521">Already last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen contributed indirectly, lease agreements with the owner of about 65 hectares large off-site.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, electricity needs to be covered by around 11 400 households - this corresponds to roughly one fifth of the electricity requirement of all four-grain households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersen's City Council provided green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich Windpark near Aachen as well as a stake in a wind energy plant in Übach-Palenberg in County of Heinsberg.</seg>

<seg id="888">Eighty percent (2002) were judged as 18 or older, whereas in further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="889">"" "in 432 cases the conclusion was that the person" "" "may be less than 18 years old." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="890">The tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>
<seg id="891">According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been stable over the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="892">"" "" "" "we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are pretty constant," "" "he said the magazine The Local." ""</seg>
<seg id="893">The high proportion of cases where the person was assessed as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seekers have lied about his age.</seg>
<seg id="894">In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases that "suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="895">When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the 581 published results, she stated that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she was 18 years old this year.</seg>
<seg id="896">The method of medical age assessment, where x-ray images of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are made, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.</seg>

<seg id="904">The work on the three bridges of Landstrasse 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.</seg>
<seg id="905">On Wednesday a seven tons of heavy concrete was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="906">"" "" "" "we are very good at the time, it works great," "" "says Reinhold Leicht, director at the department of road and traffic in the government-presidency of Freiburg." ""</seg>
<seg id="907">In April, the works began at the same time on all three reconstructions neural bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="908">The building is scheduled for October and is sure that the schedule is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads across the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is a vaulted arch bridge made of concrete, lined with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 metres.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the other bridges, it has now come into the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to ensure stability and traffic safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="914">The two other bridges lead over Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are made of red Buntsandstein.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10.60 metres long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach on Wednesday morning on the north side has a 1.30 m wide and seven ton heavy so-called bridge cap.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is a random fixation, which is also used as an operating path.</seg>
<seg id="919">On the southern part of the bridge a 2.20 m wide bridge cap should be used on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway is to pass.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing is that it is manufacturing parts, a patent from the Schramberger company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">Special fingertip emptiness required the laying of cables through the building in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">Because there is also a fibre-optic cable connected to which many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">Prior to the work, the residents were informed about the project.</seg>
<seg id="926">In addition, fish and crustaceans had to be caught.</seg>
<seg id="927">For the bridges between the building yard and the collective weiher in the direction of Schramberg the traffic is regulated one-lane by a traffic light.</seg>
<seg id="928">The road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is completely blocked for construction work on the bridge at Lauterbach Valley.</seg>
<seg id="929">The cost of the three bridge structures is 700 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="930">The whole thing is financed by the country.</seg>

<seg id="932">It is not so common that parties pull together, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to reconcile.</seg>
<seg id="933">The parties represented by Vulkaneifel (CDU, SPD, Greens, FDP, FWG, left) belong to a broad alliance that shows peaceful flags on this day, because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell invites for a poster "Great campaign start."</seg>

<seg id="943">Mario Hompes reported from AfD Vulkaneifel, he took care of such an event and got the supplement.</seg>
<seg id="944">The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf initially asked in Daun, but there was a cancellation because due to the built-in Laurentius kirmes there was not enough parking space available.</seg>
<seg id="945">"" "so now the Rondelle, Hompes is pleased that" "" "we can have such a nice event here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="946">"" "looking at the event on the Rondellplatz, he says:" "" "this is the good right of the people, the main thing, it remains peaceful." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="947">This also does: at 20.00 on the Rondellplatz square there is a band for entertainment, in the Stadthalle diverse speakers, among them the Rhineland-pfälzische AfD chairman Uwe Junge.</seg>
<seg id="948">In the hall there are about 200 listeners who wait for the top candidate for the German Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and vice-president Beatrix von Storch.</seg>
<seg id="949">The police station remained unchanged, but so far the officials had a quiet evening.</seg>
<seg id="950">Something more than an hour takes the AfD event, the guests on the forecourt have a longer breath, but also there is a short time after 21 o'clock.</seg>
<seg id="951">The police can remove - no special incidents.</seg>

<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unhindered spending of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars Weltrekord transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, as the guiding organisation that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules, launched in 2011 by the UEFA, mean that at some point it has to prove that the transfer from Neymar has been financed without major loss.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moving to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can certainly make the money loose, so that Neymar refuses and bring him into a Galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team through the royal family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs may spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but have to deal with legitimate sources of income that allow them to take Break-Even Point in their on the football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini following his election on the UEFA presidential election in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that associations who had taken enormous debt in their quest for success effectively cheated and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011 FFP shifted from concentrating on the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, the Roman Abramovich, originally used in 2003 in Chelsea, bought a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year FFP submission period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini's 2015 has fallen from the Presidency of the Ungnade, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to shrink from excessive expenses.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"" "" "" "surely FFP is not dead and we will definitely reinforce the rules for the future," "" "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week." ""</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause from Neymar in a package, it can distribute the amount for invoicing over the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar signed a five-year contract, so that the proceeds for the next five years amounting to 44.1 million euros in the financial statements can be reported.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has taken the PSG alongside Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the toughest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG was rewarded with a fine of EUR 60 million (at that time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks this little Earls Court apartment turned into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, resigned in 2014 from a big house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court Apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," Joanne says.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I looked for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with them and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot large apartment was completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne storage room and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my request, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, they commissioned the Architectural and Design Studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development but also a place to life for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms together, so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the proposition.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "" "" "the steel work is quite complicated," "" "he explains." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked over one another without having to baken us." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not only about building a simple platform, but to put the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled the Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper-light window from Retrouvius looks down via the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role when adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">On both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance we offer mirrored units for all cutlery and jars of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can shut the kitchen when it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a bit of engineering went in," "" "explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is important so that when you push the door, it is very easy to slide." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">They managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things you touch and that will help create an emotional attachment in a home" "", "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you don't love the electrical sockets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and increased square metres of slightly standardly into something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you could choose not to leave it.</seg>

<seg id="1356">Two brothers find themselves four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty in a debate on account of one of the largest real estate imperialist Victorias worth over $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton-Football Club' and designer Colin De LUTIS lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul. he brought him to the Supreme Court to let clear how their property and their assets are to be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to retire from the family business since 2014, but a sharp debate on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have acquired 38 real estate in the value of more than half a billion dollars, since then the family sold a business in Smith Street, Collingwood in 1973.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There, the Westco jeans family founded and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for $85 million in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money was invested in real estate, and De LUTIS portfolio now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">According to an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - written by Paul as "principal operator and the dominating personality" in the De LUTIS family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul is about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court file states that this means that Colin owns property valued at €316 million and Paul has a value of 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "the appraisals proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," "" "he wrote in 2015 in a first monkey." ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, have excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but throws Paul to manage some possessions incompetent.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early Affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian inheritance states that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs rise in the case, with hundreds of pages with affirmavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and from both parties held law firms.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs De LUTIS and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk-bars and delicatessen stores from the late 1950-s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first Jeansload of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says that he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De LUTIS says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to share their property with her children.</seg>

<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with executive employees on his first working day, he represented a major problem in President Donald Trumps's White House that he wanted: bad information coming into the president's hands.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said the staff that information should flow through him - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame trump by monitoring his media diets.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps's relationship to television last decades back - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "if candidate Trump was annoyed because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of jobs that were to convince," "" "said the former election campaign manager Sam Nunberg in February opposite Politico." ""</seg>

<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his staff managed to keep it away from him several times, their efforts have been worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented Trump controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">A part of the problem is that people in a White House that consist of competing parties always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may perhaps promote their views of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advisers to give the president doubtful information to the president for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts, especially those with corrupted leaks, and that he tries to find out where they come from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">That was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone banned a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh, "being the source behind a bunch of leaks" at the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson had been banished permanently from Twitter for chicans, or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he expressed false allegations in the past and revoke it.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "Trump read the article and started to ask employees about Walsh." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1415">Kelly tried three months later to do the same.</seg>

<seg id="1518">Antarctica: gigantic iceberg drives in the Antarctic</seg>
<seg id="1519">In the Western Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg of the almost seven-times size of Berlin is solved by the Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1520">This divided the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The large koloss thrust over a Billion tons of heavy and 5800 square kilometres to the north and will probably need two, three years until it was melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">With 175 km of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">As far as climate change has played a role in the fall of the iceberg, according to research data, it is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1525">In total, however, there have been a series of unusual breakdowns in the region for around 30 years, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a fact background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this can be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus was part of the Larsen-C Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">The balance of waxes and vomiting was disturbed some years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete Schelfest is crushed there, AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen writes.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There's a lot to say that even the Larsen-C Schelfeis is in danger, as the front edge never pulled back as far as currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice plate stands under tension and can fall apart if a piece is broken down on a key.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase sea level because they float on the water and put ice as much water as it results after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the Schelfest leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the level of sea level, but only to a small extent, the British research project is writing to observe the Antarctic (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen-C Schelfeis is the fourth largest Schelfest in Antarctica with almost 50,000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "although it is a natural happening and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice sign comes into a more dangerous position," "" "said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University." ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records," "" "he also confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists is contested whether the Larsen-C Schelfeis will continue to grow or go back in the long term and possibly collapsing, his colleague Adrian Luckman said and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these researchers do not fall back on climate change this gigantic iceberg, many ice tariffs of the Antarctic peninsula are falling apart over the past decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long keris of the Antarctica extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to the research program British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The temperature rise has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic peninsula has been heated by around three degrees in the last 50 years, and therewith it belongs to the areas in which the temperature rises most quickly.</seg>

<seg id="1582">Minnitis warning came a day after Italian authorities had seized a boat from the German aid organisation 'Jugend retches' because their team had effectively collaborated with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organization, which has been in operation for only one year, declined to express detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>

<seg id="1587">It is thought that its crew adopts inflatable migrants on board, which will be delivered directly by human traffickers, and that the smugglers can depart so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such coincidence found only 1.3 miles in front of the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's acts, whose content was published by Italian media.</seg>

<seg id="1631">For many, the idea is certainly getting used.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo FROBÖSE also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the German Sport School in Cologne E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions which can also be found in classical sports - for example increased heart rate, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>

<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the undertakings as recall.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are regarded as carcinogens and can cause asthma.</seg>

<seg id="1759">The companies are trying to avoid the errors of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called depreciation devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car has been tested, but return to normal driving conditions.</seg>

<seg id="1795">Lavender from Provence under threat of climate change</seg>
<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is declining because of the conditions reminiscent of drought, and due to the diseases of transmitted insects, leading scientists and farmers trying to find solutions to find great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, Expert of the Agrarian Research Institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in the past years, which brought much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small icicade, a microbibacterium that transmits dwarf cades, and with very dry weather there are many of them. "</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much on the game.</seg>

<seg id="1804">So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "</seg>

<seg id="1809">Assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of the weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what feels more secure: they should take their children to the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts wrote three words on a table on the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and gut feelings.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the payroll of the government or the cartels, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no break from violence, and while the corpses accumulate throughout the country, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto has taken office in December 2012. 589 are at least seven dead in seven countries.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter you find their editor and their inspirer of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence will be felt deep, although his presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the façade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez wear T-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a Special Proof Office has been established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, it has initiated only two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murders, each year associated with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodosia, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are not delectable and although the terrain is now even more obsessive.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information on the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know the reason, we all mistrust." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He was only able to ride a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and was shot 12 times, probably due to the name of the newspaper, which is translated with "Twelfth river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest last year and delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, as rival factions struggle here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of ornamented, two-storey mausoleums for drug-kings who are bigger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of peace if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drugs trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, broke down with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">At first there was in February the publication of an interview with Damascus Lopez, a leader of one of the rival antitrust groups in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This release may have angered the sons, gantry members bought every copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was to force Valdez, after the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story, leaving the country for its own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues in the founding of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to run journalism without violating the toxicity problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">With time, the newspaper earned a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and publicity increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to publish hard-hit examinations without fear of censorship and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot-Award" for her reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists from pursuing Mexican drug policies wherever they lead.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to continue living," "" "he said at the time of the CPJ award." ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa" "" "is a way of life," "" "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV." ""</seg>
<seg id="1854">"" "" "" "you have to take over the task which you as a journalist coincides - either that or you play the dumb." ""</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what did you do in the face of so many dead... why did you not tell what was going on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team missed valdez, the fun bird, who was like a dockworkers, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table there.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now ask them: was his love for routine his destruction?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they best do their work and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like it if you deal with their wives, their children, their clean businesses, their secret starting and runways," "" "to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"" "" "" "these things were not allowed," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust your own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells falsehood, stay away.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The anger is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that "smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the space where the employees of Riodoce came to safety training, no mobile phones were allowed. days ago it became known that spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a middle-class district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen who the governor himself considered not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It's months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape where the drug gangs are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week Riodoce gave birth on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was assassination of the brother of the former famous speaker Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposure to the public expenditure concentrated on the home town of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group going through one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Office of the Office of the Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was offered when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled nearly the entire century all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently several PRI governors were accused of high-caliber cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"" "Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one where a son of" "" "El Chapo" "" "Guzman escaped a military attack." ""</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months before, readers of Valdez had considered the best informed source of the abduction.</seg>

<seg id="1885">"" "" "" "now all channels of communication with our sources are broken." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1886">Valdez's office became a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reorterin Miriam Ramirez quickly snapped a few signs and went next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist at the Office of the Public Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burned body was detected and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">"" "in the whole country journalists have become louder by writing in organized protests" "" "SOS Press" "" "on sidewalks and buildings." ""</seg>
<seg id="1891">On this day director Bojorquez is gone out in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">During a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to pionate journalists and bring them back because they said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has been asked since then that she is regrouped by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">"" "Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, government officials and a indifferent society." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces which stuck with organised crime under a ceiling.</seg>

<seg id="1942">The astonishing maintenance of the specimen made it possible for Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the casket, a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the casket is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta surpasses by far the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It suggests that the dinosaur has been hunted by enough pressure by eating meat eaten dinosaurs that the evolution favoured the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals, who use the counter shading - think of roe deer, zebras or masts - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loot, which signals that this Nodoscope was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs predators have had to be the crayon season," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to examine the animal on evidence of his life, including his conserved intestinal content to find out what it has eaten as its last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, fell into a river and driven out into the sea, where he sank down to the seabed.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably circulated much further inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"" "" "" "this Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with conserved footwear, but also remains in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal," "" "said Brown." ""</seg>
<seg id="1953">"" "" "" "the result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same today as in the early chalk period." ""</seg>
<seg id="1954">You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you're just playing a little bit with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is sleeping. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The crayon was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs, passed through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings are published in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was buried after death in the sea and mumified in sludge.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the upholstered dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch spikes raging from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores swept through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the water cremation of the dinosaur preserved its armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the Hautes still cover up bumpy armored armored plates along the dinosaur.</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as a win in the lottery.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I approach it, the more confusing it becomes.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Petrified remains of the skin still cover the hollowed shell-plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">His right front foot rests on his side, his five fingers are spread upward.</seg>

<seg id="1972">Heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8: nearly 30 vehicles are wrapped in a mass arambolage.</seg>
<seg id="1973">There are numerous wounded, kilometre long Staus and Gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1974">On the motorway Stuttgart-Munich (A8), approximately 20 people were injured during a mass arambolage on Thursday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="1975">After the first data of the police arrived at 17.00 clock between the connecting stations Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district of Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm nearly 30 vehicles, among them probably trucks, crashed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">There are no indications of the exact number of the last ones.</seg>
<seg id="1977">It was a slight to moderate injury, said a police spokesman.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large amount of ambulance equipment was at the accident point.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">In the direction of Munich, a ten-kilometre backlog was formed.</seg>
<seg id="1981">As reported as a AZ reporter, it also occurred on the counter-track to massive handicapped - through numerous gaff.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The fire brigade noted the signs of the vehicle steering, which now have to reckon with sensitive penalties.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Shortly after 6: 45 p.m. another second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.</seg>
<seg id="1984">There was a collision between a car transporter and a passenger car.</seg>
<seg id="1985">A helicopter was on the way to the accident site.</seg>

<seg id="1999">In order to be able to use it, however, some requirements must be met: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - which is already the most passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2001">It is also necessary to have purchased the DB Navigator app, which is the most convenient way of ticket booking.</seg>

<seg id="2006">When the train driver comes to Space Y, he knows that there is a passenger with an already validated online ticket.</seg>

<seg id="2012">Those who often take the train know that apart from delays and missed trains, the trolley-control rolls are one of the biggest sleeves.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Because oftentimes one does not have all the documents required for the devaluation of online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document you have to show.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between train companions and passengers, which leads to bad mood in the section or large-space and delays in controlling their own tickets and the conductor at the end takes the time to take care of other concerns.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And that is only on trains ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>

<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "whoswhets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just one day after having arrived in New York City, the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an airbnb flat which she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled upon a post from someone from the High School.</seg>

<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly saved on her timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The rapper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo., live to tweets.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Brown's empty body stretched on the street and stayed there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"" "" "" "this is wild," "" "thought Ferrell." ""</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She stopped her cell phone to return to Tweets on the Canfield-Drive in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of the police band and people who cried out, and from a man who claimed to be Brown's father who wore a shield with the inscription: "Ferguson's police has just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feed in which a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In another video, she said, escaped another policeman his rifle and cried, "I will kill you... Animals all kill."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"" "" "" "this is not common," "" "Ferrell remembered her statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="2035">"" "" "" "this is not the kind of murder we have become accustomed to and which we can call it typical." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2036">At this moment I felt shocking.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 23 o'clock, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas of the 11th century.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance to people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">As Ferrell with her daughter, who carried a flower dress and a matching crown to Ferguson, the two had a conversation that they had many times before this morning "about the black experience and the black state."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "" "she remembered what she said." ""</seg>

<seg id="2048">It must be well developed not only activism and organisation but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience eclatant racism, she is no different from the next black woman child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">"" "I feel I would be doing a bad service to keep them away from it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first stop, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a Campaign when the activists were waiting for the possible non-prosecution of officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner, who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell's shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed completely after 9 August," she said and notices that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black churches.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan during an evening demonstration, one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">"" "Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to" "" "document" "" "what happened." ""</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "a question came to Ferrell:" "" "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often by whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resilience.</seg>
<seg id="2062">"" "as Folayan recently stated in an interview:" "" "we had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt's inmates.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought Ferrell the project, along with six other natives, the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Browns was shot.</seg>

<seg id="2067">The goal was not to concentrate on Ferrel's experience - to show that it is not a messiah leader but a community that comes together, "Folayan said - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">"" "as a result, documents of" "" "Whose Streets" "" "show surprising personal aspects of Ferrels's life as she falls in love and marries her wife." ""</seg>

<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the dehumanisation of black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrero's history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, which after killing the black teenagers Trayvon Martin in 2012 marked the film "BlackLivesMatter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"" "" "" "black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether," "" "said Ferrell," "" "and we are constantly fighting on different fronts." ""</seg>
<seg id="2074">"" "black, gay women must bear the main burden of everything." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "Folayan agreed to note that" "" "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">"" "however, it insists that" "" "this is not an affirmative type of action" "", "when Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity." ""</seg>

<seg id="2088">From "Traum" to "Size Wap": TV-readers discuss bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves the people, although it is not built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping center at the south end of the pedestrian area splits the population into proponents and opponents since the first presentation of 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">"" "" "" "cold" "" "is scarcely cold." ""</seg>
<seg id="2092">On our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg," the topic is discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">While the one to the bit-gallery says: "that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "Das wäre real klasse" (Nicole Schausten), kommt von der anderen Seite: "braucht kein Mensch" (Siggi Betzen) oder ganz einfach: "Size wahn!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the proponents stress that a gallery withdraws more customers into the city, from which the other businesses profit, the adversaries fear that the pedestrian zone bleeds.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Added: the gallery is planned exactly on the plot on which the farmers market hall stands in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the start of construction work will stop.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Galerie-Macher wants to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Beda Square with the possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Zimmer: "for many years we have been selling almost weekly in the farmers market hall.</seg>

<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a regular weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Because after all the goods offered there is fresh, mostly offered directly from the producer and is priced at the top price.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which almost imperceptibly resemble the cables hanging from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former Intelligence-Analyst verbalized a 35-year sentence after publishing his secret diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks site.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on August 2 is called A Becoming resemblance (a matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline encompassed her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a Transwoman and pioneering dissident, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg's algorithmic analysis of DNA, which was extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits, like someone with these genomic data could look a sharp, even if something intellectual comment does not only lead to the formality of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations, but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning who was born as Bradley Edward, but has been openly spoken of identification as a woman since her puberty, was convicted for 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the espionage network, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white self-ie where Manning is visibly uncomfortable sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platine blonde wig with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012 project "Stranger Visions."</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts like cigarette dumb and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg during a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal briefs who had several letters exchanged over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a comic "Suppressed Images" by Shoili Kanungo, who predict a future in which the president would transform Chelseas judgement and would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Mannings's release after seven brutal years would demand in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome type of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also at the opening of the exhibition a little deep and strong, since Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government and against transgender forces to find new, tweetable ways to avoid the rigid fissures he should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about all these things after the strange timing, she said "things are going to happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written on the wall of the Gallery, Manning with her superlarge signature including (the "i" in her surname has been marked with a heart) an end to the "automatic split" which basis gender, race, sexuality and culture have been. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall, its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandome of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist), how astonishingly similar, at least in a biological sense, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"" "" "" "what people will hopefully take along is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how open genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are," "" "said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also visible." ""</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories."</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece of the exhibition, stored in a separate room, is a page from the above mentioned comic novels.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning how she emerges from the disciplines of the United States like King Kong with a hands-talk phone in his hand.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"" "" "" "if they strike your speech, then they have won," "" "says it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2151">"" "" "" "so never stop the mouth." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2152">"" "" "" "it came directly from a letter she wrote to me," "" "said the artist, who greets out of Philadelphia." ""</seg>

<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations, has used concercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and processes and have a simple way to achieve their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Earlier, if a defendant wanted to report a problem, he or she found a phone number or email for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>

<seg id="2243">Investors gain a reputation if their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are committed and committed.</seg>

<seg id="2247">In fact, if a company asks staff after your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change is not fast enough, or not at all, this can grow disappointments and motivate employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"" "" "" "if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be willing to have 4,000 talks," "" "said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies who have relied too much on collecting data." ""</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it can not be more crazy in 2017, a new report about the technological developments in the area of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (foundation for responsible robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must start taking their ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipples and the type of fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people are making fun of them, but companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more often," "" "said Mr. Sharkey on the publication of his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions which are reached by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also adjust his robot according to his convictions and choose everything from the eye color of the robot via the shape of the nipples to the type or the color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but it is more disturbing since many robots have the" "" "personalities" "" "that would make a stepford woman progressive." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">For example, the RealBotix robot enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there's the Roxxxy Gold sex robotic developed by True Companion with pre-programmed celebrities such as "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality, which is adapted to your personality as much as possible," warmed the True Companion website.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she also has her moods - like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, fixed to conversation or she can" "" "be in mood" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female attributes, the allusions to rape, when one goes a step on Frigid (said here: resisting) Farrah, disturb one the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy compares with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "if women can have a vibrator, why can men not have Roxxxy?" "" "says it on the website." ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toys.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and increasing refinement indicate something darker and deeper in our culture, on a retreat from the ideal of gender equality into a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course not keep sex robots, and while the FRR noted their increasing popularity, they still remain on the verge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what leaks out of the edge zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlapping that these highly developed sex robots are emerging in a time when the rights of women are threatened all over the world in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted women to be sexually assaulted.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrible aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The report of the maid ') are not the graphic images, the devoured body and the engraved eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a big leap forward.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The aim behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (although with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, brought to the point when it comes to its "personalities" the robots are not real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or a background story, nothing relating to independence or anything that could disturb the fantasy of total subjection.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are pleasing slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the Speaker of 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps large performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense of human life</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a trump-wisdom of the Trump-era that the political splits that the U.S. electorate have polarized also have families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, in the USA, there were newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of a group of people.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all told to make our filter bubbles burst.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of Trumps to bring families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-hand poet, who lives in Chicago and has long worked with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House Everyone knows it, including the Republican relationship with which she had fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and completely strangely on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">To the dining table, this is certainly a good thing, but it is important to me that this also brings considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the issuing effect of his presidency has the strength to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"" "when we speak of" "" "normalization" "" "and" "" "Trump" "", "we refer to the scary possibility that his cookies of one day will no longer be cast off." ""</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is an even more difficult long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans normalise the right wing, which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself today from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the crazy - the dog on the car, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both in comparison to Trump in fact appear to be a very mild criminal offence.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be only mentally healthy to qualify as immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the New York's carousel's bikes, and the top three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are knurled and the animals turn out to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the perspirited music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines become too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the Topics pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a big roundabout in northern London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">However, Central Park carousel is still a strange magic experience, as there are two two-year-old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40-s and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, in this week I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I was able to pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my road it is the same, plus the option to balance the valuation with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to slowing down what actually should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was excused, while I wearied the experience to reach my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius postponed with chest pain from prison to hospital</seg>
<seg id="2450">For the second time, Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit.</seg>

<seg id="2452">"" "" "" "Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by the prosecutors against a first death sentence." ""</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early morning of Valentine's Day 2013 by shaking her several times through a door of the toilet cabin at his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed he kept his girlfriend for a nocturnal invader who hid himself in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius Appeal from which they say they are too transparent.</seg>
<seg id="2456">"" "the National Prosecution" "" "Prosecution" "" "said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the objection could be heard this year." ""</seg>

<seg id="2575">Just under ten passenger trains had dropped Friday mornings, two of them watched the long-distance traffic.</seg>
<seg id="2576">Freight trains did not fall out, but they had belated.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meats, dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study says exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable state in the USA affects approximately 1.3 million and 300,000 in the United States, causes stomach ulcages and flatulence, recurring or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While those affected normally avoid eating meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tryptophan contributes to the development of immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The senior researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells patrol in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not penetrate into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells capable of dissolving inflammations are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have been established that a kind of tolerance stimulating immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their bowels.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to dissolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more they had of these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">It suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet that is rich in tryptophan is more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel-intestinal inflammation, if the same system also affects people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral candidate Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same trunk, which was separated, but had not been separated.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It presumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiomes of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were sequenced and six bacterial species were found that were present in mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that an intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how bacteria appeared on the immune system, the researchers led the researchers of L. reuteri in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells that were isolated by the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerance-enhancing cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was cleansed from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as Indol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of cells increased by approximately 50 percent, but if the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant-tolerant cells like mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said:" "" "the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote because these cells control inflammations on the inner surface of the intestines." ""</seg>

<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen's report on the abuse of abuse is relieved by Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse-scandal in the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesperson for the reform movement "We are Church," explained after publication in front of the German press agency, he was expecting an apology from the former Regensburger bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as from the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their then false assessment of the events.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican newspaper" "" "Osservatore Romano" "" ", on the other hand, criticized the fact that in the reporting of violence at Domspatzen, it is measured with" "" "double standards" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubt that it would have to be "shameful and shameful acts" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of medial manipulation," the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of designating the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," "" "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">Fürstin Gloria from Thurn und Taxis also said in the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "one likes to go to the church and that is a fixed feeding."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "she also pointed out that in her youth," "" "blows have been a completely normal educational tool" "" "to be done with naughty children as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They found it unfair to apply today's standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with reports on the abuse of abuse, Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely unjustly, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the memorandum "My Brother of the Pope" with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger," "" "says Hesemann," "" "because all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly stands in the 440-page report commissioned by the Bistum Regensburg with the Enlightenment appointed attorney Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"" "a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" "" "with high plausibility" "" "victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, the fact that Domkapellmeister R. was used in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more severe.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Nevertheless, contrary to numerous other accusations, many victims denounced the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even have positive memories of him in many cases. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In an interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal in the Domspatzen, Georg Ratzinger seems relieved of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "" "incidents of Violence of Violence at the Regensburger Domspatzen" "", "gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "for one, many students emphasize his" "" "humanity" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he also appears as a cholesterol and perfectionist, which became tangible for the greener when a Domspatz produced no top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is present at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is just once dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly acquitted by every suspicion of complicity or co-workers in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Violent excesses at the pre-school also happened outside his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">At best, one can reproach him, to learn from it too late, or have not taken initial indications seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the" "" "dome" "" "gymnasium, on which he worked, was felt as literally -" "" "salvation" "", "" "" "heaven" "" "and" "" "better world" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">The vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also gives a very excellent certificate, "sincere," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as extremely good-natured teacher who provided the boys regularly with cakes, biscuits and bonbons and "always encamped" by children. "</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to widowns.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he didn't just kneel with chairs and threw the keys on the floor, but also overlaid ears and too naughty guys on the hair or ears, he himself already gave years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">For his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the fragile period, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents as well as teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think each of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually going on in this report, namely the horrible sexual abuse and violent excesses at the pre-school, the liberally bagatelles.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders whether it's not more about his familiarity and role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just fallen on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">At the Bavarian pope many people who never understood him are still busy.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report is relieved by Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, in connection with the report, much about the issue of abuse happened with the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger grounded in the final report also some involvement or co-worker with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">None of the 67 victims of sexual assaults have claimed to have entrusted himself to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I have never dared to talk about it with my father or mother," "" "said an affected behalf for the others," "" "Everything was very embarrassing to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in educating sexual abuse has been and is, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they do not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir director, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators professionally.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Scrabscab students Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questioned student put it like this: "concerning sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely insight and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... also for really absurd to assume that it was imputed to him... boys intrusive or clearer or even more opened than against their parents, dormitory managers, trust teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one talks to him about sex... is unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "the report concludes with the very clear result:" "" "that the student and / or their environment entrusted to him in advance could not be confirmed within the framework of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is therefore acquitted of all co-workers.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Thus he cannot be accused of being prevented or brought to an ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is no reason to associate its good name with these conflicting crimes, as it has unfortunately occurred in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media a lot of" "" "violent excesses" "" "had to be read with the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger was present in the report" "" "Look Out" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this reproach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that everything was mixed in the reporting and blended up to a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the midst of drin, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is exactly the abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is, namely, cleanly separated: between the pre-school and the Gymnasium of Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violent excesses as well as, let's say, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report covers incidents from the time since 1945, so also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral director of the cathedral-cats.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were quite timid and malportrayed and suffered, occurred all at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have prevailed.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys first to face when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "on that was, as most witnesses stress, the theme" "" "primary school" "" "taboo." ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">It was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "heavenly" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the school gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was a certain discipline, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger where the report concludes that" "" "many victims estimated the overall humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even combine positive memories with him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">Thus, at most, the reproach remains to be looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">Despite all efforts, the report was able to define only two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school in which he was not working and responsible, (as the witness) did not want to hear, and then until 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the school gymnasium, which even reproduced the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he pointed out that" "" "that in the pre-school, the punishment would continue to be practiced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Already in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was, as a test, had long been banned in Bavaria as well.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that they occurred in a legal grey area, as each of us still knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">"" "" "" "there was also hard to estimate for him where those affected might be exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded." ""</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one cannot say that he has always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the juridical penalty of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said yes, it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we historians talk about the "snare of anachronism," meaning the danger of evaluating past moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">"" "" "" "the princess has already right." ""</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this, of course, does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abhorred at all times, and not for what has been vomited in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's seabed, which goes far beyond the usual.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very awful and I am glad that it will finally be reworked.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishing, thus creating ear figs and the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then banned, he also strictly adhered to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "what picture of his" "" "Regensburger Zeit" "" "has reproduced Georg Ratzinger in the talks with you for the book" "" "My Brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the topic test penalty also come to speech?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI., tells from his perspective that the cathedral-cats played only a side-role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I did not at all refuse to lead a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must be said: without this perfectionism, without claiming unconditional discipline, it would hardly be possible for him to form an institution of world trang from the until then rather nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the United States (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and bonbons alone, you don't have a big singer and any success, right in which field, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people did you experience Georg Ratzinger in talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I have experienced Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced again and again as wonderful, humorous, gratuitous, deeply believing and heartfelt people from which one can't imagine that he could do something just one fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I am regular with how many former Domspatzen still today, 23 years after his emeritization, regularly contact him, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who do not forgive him until now that he was once severe to them, are thus clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Today, most of the Domestic cats are grateful to him for enriching their lives and bringing them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, sure, that may be - but still a lovable person who has to look up today and adore it downright.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again quite clear: all that you submit to it are educational methods that were on the agenda back then.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intention behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report, which was just published, relieves him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the uprising would have a 93-year-old man who has earned great merits and without the exception of Bavaria and perhaps Germany nobody would know the Domestic Swedes, finally in peace.</seg>
