Jenni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put into drawers
Jenni@@ fer Ani@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
this has made the Hollywood star un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clear in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always stuck in drawers or glu@@ ed from outside labels that have little to do with me and reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself have not the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hon@@ estly , these things are more sn@@ u@@ ff to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jenni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Sc@@ ene Inv@@ estig@@ ation ( # 1.01 Pilot ) ( TV )
&quot; &quot; &quot; for white glu@@ t , she brings the question to the wish of a child : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;

gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger wins the sport pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger with some colleagues searched a bit di@@ version with a ride on the beach .
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; CHI@@ O : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; golden Sport@@ pyramid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes the horses remembered their fes@@ tivities , they hun@@ ted at home for a quick gal@@ lo@@ p home .
a kilometer at this speed , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and so the equ@@ est@@ rian career ended up again .
on Saturday , Germany was the best gol@@ fer ever - 101 tournament vic@@ tories - again near horses .
he left his family on the grounds of AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even sw@@ ang for photo purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and with it also at CHI@@ O .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German orth@@ op@@ a@@ edi@@ c sur@@ rendered to the man from An@@ hausen as part of a small Gala the Golden Sports Pyr@@ amid .
it does not lack the sympath@@ etic ath@@ l@@ ete .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silber@@ nes Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen had already ad@@ mi@@ red him .
a long one is the 18th pri@@ zew@@ inner of the sport pyramid .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for it is not only awarded for sporting success , but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger has been promoting offspring .
and so he also gave the prize money of 25,@@ 000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ fold American Master Win@@ ner was added to the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of the German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , the Fech@@ ter Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ thier Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ eke , the Spring@@ reiter Al@@ win Sch@@ ock@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ um of the Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company mig@@ rated to the Spring@@ st@@ adion , where the Lav@@ azza prize went .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clinton and Tr@@ umps Economy Policy in Compar@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investing in infrastructure and preventing the T@@ TP trade agreement - we want both Clinton and Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the two US presidential candidates are at tax and energy policy , as well as in a fundamental issue .
differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosophi@@ cal difference .
that , on the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doubt , Tr@@ ump wants to keep in doubt small and war@@ n about how the state can harm the economy - with tax and regulation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , says Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will massi@@ vely withdraw regulations and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , states : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , it has opportunities to open @-@ up opportunities and needs money .
that is why taxes for the rich would increase , they say .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which needs to be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost word @-@ like . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the democratic candidate under@@ takes the greatest investment in new jobs since World War II .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are dismis@@ sed by the state @-@ critical te@@ apart@@ y wing of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
so on Tr@@ ump , there could be more party discussions .
the differences in energy and climate policies are more evident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas , the Paris climate protection agreement will announce it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , with its investment program , Clinton wants to expand and demand the renewable energies : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two cont@@ enders are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ sp@@ azi@@ fic trade agreement , do not want to sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , both the US do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade , but simply to better protect American jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should be paid even better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Clinton . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the present minimum wage of $ 7,@@ 25 is a hunger .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must go down , then he says he should not be changed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the big discussion of the coming months is probably more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand is Tr@@ ump , who wants to rel@@ ieve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his critics ad@@ here to him so that the budget defic@@ it would only increase .
on the other hand Clinton , which at least wants to demand from the rich , wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution .
escape : &quot; every w@@ ing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence is a part of women who are fle@@ eing alone , almost everyday .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house has shelter .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
each has a baby that is at most a year old .
one has placed her little son in his arm .
he looks in@@ quis@@ i@@ tive in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the table top .
until she not@@ ices that she is observed .
she sm@@ iles briefly and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you talk with Katrin B@@ ahr .
she is an executive director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier of social welfare services in Bavaria , and among other things he deals with the issue of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are p@@ oul@@ try .
they live in the Munich north in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for all @-@ w@@ ing@@ ed women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs visited the institution together with Pro Familia and Frau@@ enk@@ irche in Munich .
it has been officially opened for a long time .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - also not as a visitor .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has made experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are persec@@ uted politically because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as a bear@@ er of hope , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; women out@@ weigh other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many ste@@ al secre@@ tly because they do not see any other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their home they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , hon@@ orary mor@@ als , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this is driving them away .
on the run this goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that tu@@ g@@ boats for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not a rar@@ ity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who think that the end as soon as they arrived in Germany , B@@ ahr tells .
here too , single women in refugee @-@ shel@@ ters would often be regarded as inferior and ab@@ used in the worst .
this means that about 90 percent of women living in the shelter in the North of Munich are trau@@ mati@@ zed , they appreciate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so ac@@ custom@@ ed to say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the experience , because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often do not know to help , they need more accommodations just for them , demands B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for accommo@@ dating refugees .
on the question whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , some respond with no .
in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , there is no such thing in accommodations of the governments .
even in Sw@@ ab@@ ians alone , w@@ ing@@ ed women are not separated , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodation exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rights of Women and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separately by men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it is said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women will be hosted separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack the privacy or being accommod@@ ated together men and women , it can - for@@ getting - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , is in the study .
how much women feel this need of protection can be read at the And@@ rang , which gives it to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have been saying that there is us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could easily set up a second house .
assistant veter@@ in@@ arians : demands for new work campaigns
representatives of the assist@@ ants have called upon their union to appro@@ ve new work campaigns in their disputes with respect to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) has demanded its entire Council to appro@@ ve more work combat activities from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that the ministers agreed to deal with the concerns regarding the contract .
in July , assist@@ ants and medical students agreed to reject a contract agreed with the B@@ MA .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members that was published on Thursday night on Twitter , the president of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government would have remained calm to problems , which led to the agreement to be rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of that , the J@@ DC Executive Board agreed to fully reject the proposed new contract and call for official new negotiations to all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board today set up a formal request for a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council to appro@@ ve a running program of escal@@ ating labor struggles which begin at the beginning of September .
the disputes led to the assistance of assistance physicians of this year six times , the first general cases in the history of the N@@ HS .
the director of the B@@ MA assistant physician Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , after the election , came back to the rejection of the agreed contract conditions recommended by the B@@ MA .
he shared B@@ MA members during the meetings that took place before the vote by 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants and medical students , that the contract should be beneficial and accepted .
following the vote , the Health Minister Jerem@@ y H@@ unt said that the contract for doctors in England would be introduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia and Turkey : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alliance of aliens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to pro@@ claim an official end of the eight month long war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter@@ part in the gold @-@ plated audi@@ torium of St. Petersburg Palace , I can &apos;t defend myself from the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most .
there was a hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile was sm@@ alli@@ ble and he barely radi@@ ated heat , even for his restra@@ ined circumstances .
Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times .
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
the next day a newspaper stated that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if there had never been anything bad .
to me his enthusiasm seemed rather to indicate the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had nothing to forget .
on the contrary , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his intro@@ duc@@ tory words : the shot of a Russian figh@@ ter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was w@@ asted .
Putin spread out and accused Ankara , Russia fell into his back .
the off@@ ence was even greater because it was celebrated by a supposed friend .
re@@ building the V@@ etr@@ auen is difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media carried out a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at one time , it seemed as if the Tur@@ ks would bear the blame for everything .
the most serious were the alle@@ g@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan had benef@@ ited from illegal oil trading in regions of Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has denied this .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin from President Erdo@@ gan received the exc@@ use he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the benefits of a cease @-@ fire are clear on the hand .
Erdo@@ gan needs first and foremost all friends whom he can get after he has been enth@@ r@@ alled by a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat in almost his ministry last month .
repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also sh@@ aken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number declined by almost 90 % .
tour operators and charter companies in Russia will be reli@@ eved when the flights are res@@ umed .
they count on a late ais@@ onal ons@@ lau@@ ght of the Mediterranean .
this week the state television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agr@@ arian imports are again allowed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti artic@@ ulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry at the West as it respon@@ ds to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak answer .
to this end , the continued gru@@ dge on the sn@@ ail @-@ emp@@ o of EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ke on it is to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey to the West .
the Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara that he sought after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat in favour of the elected officials .
this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep fear of regime change .
the summit in this splendid palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to port@@ ray &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries that viol@@ ate the West and are badly treated and are now alli@@ ed .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents were told at the press conference that they would not have taken the issue once .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Turkey &apos;s President promised to answer a question about their differences , while Putin has decided to stress it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no clear con@@ sensus on what a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey sho@@ ok the Russian fighting jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state are talking at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available for customers outside Scotland
according to the Bank &apos;s head office , the R@@ BS brand is to be reduced to a back office roll .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
ROSS Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself , when it had to be almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at this time trademark holders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ user financial brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported international sport with millions of pounds at sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations rug@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to put more national brands into focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centr@@ alised headquarters and stock exchange are going to change to Nat@@ alia .
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for private customer business , which will get more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a viewing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B becomes our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed , since we are now more to be a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say now that we do not pursue global objectives , but local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customer among these brands .
R@@ BS announced that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sport sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to develop to the brands of brands , because how do we concentrate inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Board of Directors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can again launch these brands , so I think that time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches its 3,@@ 000@@ th profit at New@@ market on Pre@@ dile@@ ction
D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ ys champagne after a double at New@@ market giving it 3,@@ 000@@ th gain
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday .
he set a milestone on Pre@@ dile@@ ction , which was trained by John Gos@@ den on his local race track with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey , which reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he succe@@ eds Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who previously won on G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ett@@ ori &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; takes up the che@@ er when he gets the victory on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pre@@ dile@@ ction &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 vic@@ tories in a record @-@ breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4.@@ 493 Kar@@ rier@@ esi@@ denz
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of the modern age and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone only few minutes before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ lect that distingu@@ ishes him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for racing , his enthusiasm and char@@ isma has been enthusiastic fans for years for this sport .
I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already fet@@ ched 6,@@ 000 wins if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has been lucky in the UK for nearly 30 years , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori pre@@ mier@@ ed the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flag@@ ship of the British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve @-@ writing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received drug prohibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Russian Putin fir@@ med Stab@@ sch@@ ef Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin un@@ expect@@ edly dismis@@ sed his Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was part of Putin &apos;s closest confi@@ d@@ ant .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Represent@@ ative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
in a statement of the Krem@@ lin , it is that Putin has ordered the dismis@@ sal of Ivan@@ ovo from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been a dep@@ uty since 2012 , has been appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital of Tallinn , he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute of International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo .
on the Krem@@ lin web site it is called ( in Russian ) that he later was a log manager and Chief Executive Officer of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of state in respect of bills and controls to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the sm@@ iling faces ?
this step has under@@ gone Moscow secre@@ tly .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest confi@@ d@@ ants Vladimir Put@@ ins and works like him for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
during a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ igned at his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
is this the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at the moment .
but the official statement - that a man who once was tou@@ ted as a potential president at once would like to lead Russian environmental policy - met great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin that are c@@ ited on the website of the Krem@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , I could say this very complicated post - you could almost say - entr@@ ust job for four years .
as it turns out , I have been Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and , like Putin , a former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Bund@@ essi@@ cher@@ heits@@ dienst ( F@@ SB ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his dep@@ uty .
when Putin was in power he named Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted most .
it was once assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term of office , since Putin had viol@@ ated Putin &apos;s third term of office .
but this post was taken by another , approaching allies Put@@ ins , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister , before he became the President three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical examination at the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced his dismis@@ sal in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , ap@@ ologi@@ zed publicly on Thursday before the announcement of his dismis@@ sal .
at the set , there came to artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details about how the character Gi@@ bs@@ ons from the series , which follows a team of F@@ BI agents , will be published according to the statement of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios at a later date .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the Sit@@ com D@@ har@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been with it since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love criminal Min@@ ds and have put my whole heart blood in the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was hoping to be there until the end , but it will no longer be possible .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans who can only wish for a series .
the scheduled broadcast of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28 .
puzzles for fish , which landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a population of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks it could act with the 75 fish around Sand@@ a@@ ale , which were mir@@ r@@ ored by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , released a video of the spectac@@ le in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ ferry Crossing : bridge now associated with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017
engineers connected the nor@@ th@@ deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings to the vi@@ adu@@ ct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling fans &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are near@@ ing completion for each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge of the bridge of Fi@@ fe is 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 cranes .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017 .
economic Minister Kei@@ th Brown paid a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go on the bridge from the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment in building the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of an engineering of an truly ep@@ ic extent in this project with more than 30.000 tonnes of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , completion of the sealing between the vi@@ adu@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
in total , almost 79 % of the complete deck de@@ cks at their place and the final section of the de@@ cks today in Ros@@ y@@ th gets a concrete shot for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place .
Michael Martin , project leader of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tor , said : &quot; the first cl@@ asp is a significant milestone in every bridge project .
in this fantastic project , the closure represents forward @-@ looking high @-@ construction and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last road covering and its connection with the Nord@@ tur@@ m@@ deck currently under construction , we had to close the still existing gap on the north or north side .
this was reached 700 millimeters south by drag@@ ging the northern fe@@ eder bridge .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massi@@ vely , as the vi@@ adu@@ ct is 222 meters long , weighs about 6@@ .000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % .
delicate as the toler@@ ances on which the team worked , were tiny - on each side they were just a few milli@@ metres .
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue at Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men are lucky to be alive . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck@@ ily still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; after they were thrown from their fishing boat ahead of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI rescue station hit the Friday at 13 : 20 B@@ ST alarm after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat moved from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat around and turned the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already fle@@ w the boat out of reach until we left water , &quot; he added .
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a boat without a life@@ jacket .
they all came abo@@ ard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water have luck un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bo@@ ath@@ ed motor had a stop@@ per , but it loos@@ ened the boat from the person who controlled the boat .
someone wo@@ ke up today about these men .
seriously injured - man sticks to his ex @-@ girl@@ friend
a man has attacked and severely injured his ex @-@ girl@@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife .
as the police told yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had gotten the key to the apartment to get his personal belong@@ ings .
instead , the alcoholic perpet@@ r@@ ator cuts the clothes of his ex @-@ girl@@ friend .
when they came into the flat , he stab@@ bed them twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured at the hand and on the body .
the police arrested the perpet@@ rat@@ ors .
while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girl@@ friend , he called his mother .
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Sc@@ ene Inv@@ estig@@ ation ( TV )
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
but she could not move it to leave the apartment .
therefore she went out of the house with her companions .
on the road they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ life @-@ wife .
when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old cher@@ ished his sister and attacked his ex @-@ girl@@ friend .
who is building favourable flats in Braunschweig ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and the Gre@@ ens mean : investors should be taken a lot more strongly in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Brun@@ swi@@ ck will lose almost 1,@@ 300 affordable apartments in the coming years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; living concept &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next meeting of the council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but fight is programmed .
first and foremost it is about the question : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr Christoph Fri@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Green Party : whoever wants to build on urban areas must in future reject 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cheap apartments , however , can also be found in the inventory .
however , the major point in the town hall is , however , as Brat@@ man said : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas , but as as 20 percent of the apartments as a social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban residential construction program , which will cost millions and is still to be financed , should provide incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , so Brat@@ man : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few regulations as possible .
the left wants to be even harder for investors .
not@@ with@@ standing this , Brat@@ man , a shar@@ pen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market .
if the concept of action is implemented , it will take care of additional tasks in the building administration .
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the programme does not yet stand entirely : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how do you compare the loss of other 1,@@ 300 affordable apartments whose promotion will exp@@ ire in the coming years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments .
to prevent this , so the planning policy spokes@@ person Nicole Palm , should now be purchased from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought to bring apartments back into price fixing .
this is possible in the western city .
one fell s@@ woo@@ p the problem .
because in the western city there are dead@@ lines for the end of the year .
around 1800 flats can be found there back into price binding for cheap apartments .
only : this does not want the owners , the apartment building companies .
because the number of social housing in the western city is raised again dras@@ tically , one remo@@ ves itself from the goal of so @-@ called interference .
there should be no more concentration of social weak in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be still movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; vice @-@ president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke means : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must be in the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this has indeed focused on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise cannot be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
the fact that teen@@ agers and children do not go outside to play outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on screens , has been su@@ ed by many over the last decade .
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and becoming more active .
the time on the screen was initially on the TV , then video games and most recently restricted to smartphones .
so it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not excl@@ ude each other .
of course , I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters created first for the video games in the 1990s ( later emerged from it a carto@@ on series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) .
like many phenomena in pop culture , the interest in the release of the game in the United States , Australia and New Zealand dimin@@ ished at the beginning of July something .
market launch in other countries has been post@@ pon@@ ed by the massive demand that the servers over@@ loaded .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ emon that can be followed by a GPS and once they have been found , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( via a scre@@ enshot on the cell ) or &quot; captured &quot; can be captured .
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the f@@ au@@ c@@ et and jump@@ ed for the search of the sofa .
in the United States , the game resulted in a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person returns every day .
Car@@ di@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch who pursu@@ es 35,@@ 000 users , recently announced that within two days of the launch of the game , the number of persec@@ uted people who exercise 30 minutes each day , jump@@ ed from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns for health , people want to take &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to come from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be active every day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because many public messages are d@@ ull to health and come from people who look el@@ usive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sports cannot be over@@ valued .
anyone driving sports regularly reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps with weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here .
but the miracle of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine and fun .
some people even close new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
as always , there are also m@@ ür@@ ish players who have to compl@@ ain about something .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what should it be ?
it has happened a breakthrough .
even if Smartphone Apps like Fit@@ bit could have followed our activity earlier , they didn &apos;t give us a reason to do sport as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will be om@@ itted with time .
however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and will help many people to hunt more active , gr@@ ate and heal@@ thier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the foundation
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all the immune .
dynam@@ ically on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
on whole line brilliant .
and now also the Olympi@@ asi@@ eg@@ erin .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ in kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday for a multi @-@ battle title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spot@@ light of the Olympic Games .
her total score of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly ahead of the Silver med@@ al winner and Final Five &quot; team member A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alli@@ st Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt at the Swedish bar during the solo @-@ campaign of women during the Summer Olympics in Rio de Jan@@ eiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American woman who wins a multi @-@ campaign title and in total the fifth , while she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at this moment found an end .
this success puts them in the same le@@ ague as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps who have brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years her sport , 15 world medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mix of am@@ bition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Res@@ cue from her said she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I have ever seen . &quot;
she expected a final examination in Brazil , a competition , which was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a hand@@ ful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered dis@@ appointment .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man embrace each other after they won gold and silver in the individual multi @-@ camp site of women during the Summer Olympics in Rio de Jan@@ eiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es took the first med@@ al on Tuesday while she served as excl@@ am@@ ation mark on the far@@ ewell party of the retired man coordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi .
although Bil@@ lie insi@@ sted , during their long journey to the top , never planned to have the future planned , this is not really true .
part of its floor exercises - which includes its typical bed@@ rock pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coinci@@ dence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school trip in the gym , where Bo@@ or@@ man trained , became strength .
since the summer of 2013 , she has lost no more competition competition , a winning series that will continue as long as it wishes .
even if Must@@ af@@ ina was easily introduced by two fil@@ aments , the picture r@@ ins@@ ed .
Schwe@@ be@@ bal@@ ken and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ nen - in which Bil@@ es holds the World Championship title .
she repeated again with 15,@@ 433 on the floating beam - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground still put one on it .
R@@ ais@@ man embrac@@ ed her sof@@ tly when she expected her grand@@ child - a pure form@@ ality - and tears stre@@ amed bright red , white and blue las@@ hes , as the vision she once described in her book @-@ book , became reality .
R@@ ais@@ man &apos;s performance was a reven@@ ge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze med@@ al went to Must@@ af@@ ina in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke .
this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old man &apos;s capital , which is called &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; by the Americans , had a lead .
after their so@@ ils , she threw himself down to the public , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which at times seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as for Bil@@ es , the rapidly expanding twe@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims shot in serial killer fall while listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl shot , who had been killed in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first mass mur@@ der@@ ous fall of Phoenix as they stopped in the car and listened to music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ v@@ eway , said the authorities .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand fire weapon while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police told us that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder did not seem to be the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y case , as the att@@ acker did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , which took possession of one of the adult victims .
the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that shooting the investig@@ ators lead a closer look at whether it is connected to four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in a total of nine attacks within four months and two others were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is happening in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Howard the K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the susp@@ ect has used several vehicles including a brown Nis@@ sans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks were bound up and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to their injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which was fired at an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer .
the investig@@ ators found pat@@ rons and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it gets better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ uto loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like the least of his anti@@ qui@@ ties Ed@@ mund &apos;s micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ uto did not know during her pregnancy .
when he first came home , my first thought , I did not create it .
I do not create it .
after that I did not let myself in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is not right at all -- of course , one has got involved in it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Vincent and her has been told that Ed@@ mund may never recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer to this was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ uto . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a subsi@@ dy .
Ed@@ mund was not able to sit nor cra@@ w@@ l up until his third year of life and he still cannot speak .
but he is making progress slowly .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language , which Ed@@ mund presented for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing me something before &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bring him drawing language , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ uto C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented several characters alone .
micro@@ cep@@ hal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the z@@ ic@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
symptoms and progn@@ oses may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of those with the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ uto is remin@@ is@@ cent of the emotional price of an un@@ aware future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and it still doesn &apos;t know .
I have been asking for a pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I do not expect it to really tell me someone .
but Pic@@ ci@@ uto has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth defects caused by the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus .
it gets better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy ra@@ ins , floo@@ ding gives rise to b@@ ail@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
violent ra@@ inf@@ alls and large @-@ scale flo@@ ods in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call the emergency room on Friday .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi floo@@ ded their banks and threatened with large @-@ scale flo@@ ods after extreme ra@@ inf@@ alls , the National Weather Service reported .
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Ed@@ wards informed that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the move to the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ person for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ edness of Gover@@ nor , shared that the requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand bags increased .
Ste@@ ele said that alone the congregation of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a had requested ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used over large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service could be said that in this area there could be an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood @-@ early warning system was deployed on Friday , while Mobile continued ra@@ ined in the area of Mobile .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , are likely to reach record levels over the weekend .
the meteor@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many homes close to Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a down@@ ward in@@ und@@ ated floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these are only slowly flowing into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as via the flowing rivers .
the river Tick@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi state border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level on Friday at 09@@ .00 , which was ever recorded .
rescue teams still ski@@ pped people out of flood water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ k@@ inson in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were res@@ cu@@ ed near Glo@@ ster on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that the water of Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , has risen by night .
he said that another step@@ son who lives near him had warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are awake and the water po@@ unded and poured in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife told Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years in which she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members would have all han@@ di@@ caps and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that No@@ thel@@ fer had res@@ cu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the flo@@ ods &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quickly spread &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as there were still heavy ra@@ inf@@ alls and that the authorities should consider evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer reported near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the soil has been considerably sur@@ faced by the ra@@ inf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities indicated that heavy ra@@ ins and road floo@@ ding caused the saving of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a Par@@ ish and teaching staff in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a co @-@ ordin@@ ate in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a 200 floo@@ ded houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches which now both were floo@@ ded .
the leader of the community of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities saved 72 people and seven domestic animals washed off by the flood .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , shel@@ ters were established to host the evacu@@ ees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the water begins to go back , they will be able to return to their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a , almost two dozens of roads were closed due to the high water and provided sand bags for the residents who hope to keep the water from their houses and stores .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last great flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Rupert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Co@@ unt@@ ys said that it was raining at the Gulf Coast .
according to his statements , a hand@@ ful of houses on Thursday were reported as floo@@ ded , but on Friday were not reported .
Kei@@ th Town@@ son , Manager of Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw water in places where I never saw it before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mah@@ aj Brown , 6 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; en@@ riches &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; survi@@ ves fir@@ ing in Philadelphia &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police for@@ ks that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time a six @-@ year @-@ old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Mah@@ aj Brown .
the grand@@ parents admitted that Brown suffered several fir@@ ing injuries including in the lo@@ ins , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was in the hospital when he was transported to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a great deal , his small body was en@@ rich by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it .
the condition of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy told the sender that he is expected to recover .
he should have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old who finds himself in a critical condition , reports on the transmitter .
the other two victims were not found in the car and the police were det@@ ained exactly if one of the injured men of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors could be found .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seems to have come to a cross @-@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
cartridge sleeves for storm guns , which were trac@@ ed back to various hel@@ mets , s@@ wo@@ oned the Tat@@ ort .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seems that this is clearly a continuing fight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the road , on both sides of the way , the sleeves were found .
thus it seems to have given several armed fighters that were very actively involved , &quot; said police cut@@ ters Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the radio station .
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no arrest and police check the surveillance video at the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cross @-@ sl@@ um@@ ber on the arm when she played in front of her house in the neighborhood of West Oak Lane .
she reco@@ vers and the police still searches for a susp@@ ect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
this is what I present to myself among women &apos;s Olympic Games in the gymn@@ asi@@ um and that is more than a reason .
first , since 1984 I have been with every summer Olympics and the US has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three gymn@@ asts , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man , the Jew@@ ess and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is Cath@@ o@@ lics , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic feminine presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one under the female gymn@@ ast was an A@@ fr@@ o American woman .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympi@@ ad of Olympics and America .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion@@ ships Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they were not expected but master@@ ful G@@ ym@@ as@@ tics routines .
on Thursday Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American woman who won gold in an individual campaign for women .
team member A@@ ly R@@ ais@@ man won Silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but do not look for gymn@@ as@@ tics classes throughout the country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all hit the same path as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to create it into the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympic team will have only four gymn@@ asts in the team . moreover , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ ol@@ yi as trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality is that gymn@@ asts are a more expensive sport and gymn@@ asts are primarily in private sports clubs that are maintained by parents who pay for training , orientation , travel , clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) . the list can be continued at any time .
the majority of these gymn@@ as@@ tics are in weal@@ thy localities that can support the business .
in these clubs , the gymn@@ asts receive their entire training and that is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both trained their athletes since they started with the gymn@@ as@@ tics .
we need to au@@ n the municipalities au@@ n inn@@ um@@ erable young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more affordable and easily accessible turn@@ table training .
I founded my gymn@@ asi@@ um of 20 years .
at my events we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for more than 15,@@ 000 urban young people ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trains national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Det@@ roit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics that can make the opportunity to learn and benefit from this fantastic Olympic sport .
gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team who bring thousands of young girls to be interested in gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this true representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; through the Hol@@ en of the Olympic team golf and thanks , you have motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women .
assist@@ ants would like to organise further strikes after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a reform@@ ist contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37,@@ 000 assist@@ ants voted for a vote rejected him .
in July H@@ unt had revealed plans to introduce the treaty and said that the N@@ HS had been found in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful .
the first resident doctors are supposed to receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekend work to improve the care for periods of time .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , President of the B@@ MA det@@ ain@@ ees for resident doctors last night in a communication with : &quot; resident doctors have still serious concerns about the proposed contract , in particular that it will cure the current occupation crisis and it will be said to treat all doctors to justice . &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors falls under the new contract , progress has to be made and time runs out .
efforts by the B@@ MA to resolve the disputes by talks with the government on account of ref@@ using to participate and sometimes to silence about de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this was done by the promise that Jerem@@ y H@@ unt had made only last month that his door would always be off@@ ended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y H@@ unt must act now to lift up the constra@@ int and address the wor@@ ries of the assist@@ ants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he does not do so , the assist@@ ants have made it clear that they are ready to carry out more work combat actions .
last strike at the end of April saw a post@@ pon@@ ement of nearly 13,@@ 000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and doctors were involved in gran@@ ting doctors on the quar@@ ry cover .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the reform@@ ist contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
the B@@ MA wishes for a better week pay for the 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the N@@ HS employee , called on the assist@@ ants to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work campaigns achieve nothing but little , but already burden over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patients , car@@ ers and their families only concerns , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last two months we have spoken to the Chief of the assist@@ ants and responded positively to the concerns regarding tut@@ el@@ age and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stri@@ es .
employers hoped that the continuing positive commitment to other important topics - such as sending , flexibility in training , training courses , mutual recognition of the cur@@ riculum , training vac@@ ations and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious they were the employers , Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the B@@ MA in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day medication which can reduce heart rate risk
thousands of heart attacks patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication , recommended by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the drug Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of re@@ peti@@ tive heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the medication is ad@@ ministered 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack .
the N@@ HS regulation authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulation authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form pads .
when the covering breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots causing the flow of blood to the heart and causing a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots dis@@ sol@@ ves , it can flow through the blood@@ stream and clo@@ g the flow of blood to the brain , causing a stroke .
individuals who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk .
Tic@@ in@@ rel@@ or , produced by British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and mark@@ eted under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely .
the NI@@ CE instructions published today recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the NI@@ CE Health Care Evaluation Centre , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who suffered a heart attack , have another heart attack or stroke - often with dis@@ astro@@ us consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that Tic@@ in@@ rel@@ or is effectively in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in reducing further heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who already had a heart attack .
due to a preliminary recommendation of Tic@@ in@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of Tic@@ in@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of ble@@ eding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rec@@ tness &quot; Culture to flour@@ ish in Muslim areas
the former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man was removed from office for corruption last year due to corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ tness explains that widespread election fraud in Muslim communities is know@@ ingly ignor@@ ant as a devast@@ ating government report disclosed today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former member of the cabinet , Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es , verb@@ ally attacks the police , election observation and town coun@@ cils to ignore evidence of elec@@ toral abuse on the basis of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ no and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former minister of integration and communal government , who is now an anti @-@ corruption sc@@ andal , said that the in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation of vot@@ ers from religious reasons would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up shut @-@ off bands outside of elec@@ tive cabins to protect in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ated vot@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that vot@@ ers should have a badge to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the moment a vot@@ er has to name his name and address .
the report proposes not to apply removable ink on the finger of a person when they submit their vote to prevent someone el@@ ects twice .
whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions from un@@ official committees or working groups . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this serves not only against elec@@ toral fraud , but also to protect the local government from the wider corruption and financial fraud culture that is associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Dow@@ ning Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets Wahl@@ sc@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
last year , a Special Court decided that the reig@@ ning Mayor Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man should be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his office .
the court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way , &quot; and that he had sil@@ enced his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man should have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the rel@@ ig@@ matic duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the consequence of a im@@ itation in which one person cho@@ oses to be someone else .
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country .
he expressed particularly alar@@ ming about the frau@@ dul@@ ent postal code - in which the older members of the Muslim community would have made pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the elec@@ toral system , including joining expressions to prove the identity
in his report , it says : &quot; as proof it was appropriate that pressure was exer@@ ted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elderly , especially communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or b@@ ang@@ la@@ ese background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions would have unk@@ now@@ ingly ignored such behavior because of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity regarding eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists work letter templates to stop &quot; elec@@ toral harvest . &quot;
the report , drawn into consideration by Ther@@ esa May , also demands tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the elec@@ toral directory to be used on immigration and social fraud purposes .
consider options to ask vot@@ ers before choosing your ID .
do not use removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has left her voice to prevent someone el@@ ects twice .
systematic reviews of the nation@@ ality of a person to ensure that they are optional .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications for an automatic postal code .
prohibition that political activists deal with complete mail@@ ings and envel@@ op@@ es of letter elections .
the police have the authority to set off barriers for election stations .
a change in the law which alle@@ vi@@ ates an indictment for in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation in accordance with the 1983 re@@ pression of the People Act 1983 ( national representation Act 1983 ) .
photography ban in elec@@ toral stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the voting stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that employees usually prevail that vot@@ ers alone go to the cabin .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let case , no criminal complaint was asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elec@@ toral court has declared Lut@@ fur Rah@@ man and his dep@@ uty for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to a number of reasons he was found guilty - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings - guilty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also cri@@ tici@@ zes the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check@@ points &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the election registrations of the town halls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric said , &quot; The court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a warning signal .
our country bears a proud heritage when the mother of parli@@ aments , but the wor@@ rying and covered spread of elec@@ toral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .
crazy after K@@ ates Rad@@ ler Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger of Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio have advised the French cycli@@ st Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T out of the border and band , who proved to be an impressive Doppel@@ gän@@ ger of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic Champion is by far not the only one to compete for Gold fighting Ath@@ l@@ ete who has his own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not if one is allowed to believe the social media faith .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that fli@@ cker at the time on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympics that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the hun@@ ts@@ man and the wolf : team member of the U.S. team in Archery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood
apart from K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the bicycle race , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher of the twin of a @-@ celeb@@ r@@ ity could be Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio .
the team member of the U.S. team in Archery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son has created a ons@@ lau@@ ght on Twitter after pictures on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ins@@ anity in the social media and admitted that he has been hearing since his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself don &apos;t see any great simil@@ arity , except for facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I do this as compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Harris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her big , expres@@ sive eyes should go through as Doppel@@ gän@@ ger for the Cub@@ an American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the pool the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared to G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
one course higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor
another persistent comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has a similarly severe eyeb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver med@@ al swi@@ mmer Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova has more than just the sun @-@ fried skin and blond hair as the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ Cor@@ d , while American Nathan Adrian has att@@ ested to a &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : soccer star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jenni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial shape and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities
theory into the room : according to this user there is perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jenni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US soccer star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jenni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar facial shape and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons covered K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney and the Gold Med@@ al winner in Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , who has her own beautiful , wide smile resem@@ bling Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the C@@ BC commentary for the Olympic Games ap@@ olog@@ ises for his statement that Chinese swi@@ mmer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a pig . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds analysis over the fourth place of the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Ai Yan@@ han at d@@ r 4x@@ 200m Frei@@ stil@@ geb@@ ou@@ st@@ aff@@ el ou@@ trag@@ ed audience of the C@@ BC Live broadcast of the Ol@@ m@@ yp@@ ian Games on Wednesday
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Canadian broad@@ c@@ aster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comm@@ ent@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese swi@@ mmer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; went off &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and during the race like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a pig died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comm@@ ent@@ ator B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off when at the end of the 4x@@ 200m , fre@@ estyle swi@@ m@@ suit gave his own opinions .
Mac@@ Donald , who was caught in the commentary team of the C@@ BS in order to give more &quot; colour , &quot; you could hear : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited , he went as M@@ ief , died like a pig .
thanks for this .
the Chinese swi@@ mmer Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the bu@@ oy@@ ancy arms 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds s@@ lower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , making it possible to open the gap to China .
audience across Canada quickly re@@ acted online after they were sho@@ cked by the sound and language
&quot; &quot; &quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ as the C@@ BC commentary said , that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a pig died &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? ? ? ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot did not enc@@ ap@@ sul@@ ate that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai Yan@@ han from China was described as follows : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
the criticism against B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard where many people were talking about him .
Twitter users did not go back when they heard how un@@ sensi@@ tively B@@ yr@@ on Mac@@ Donald was
&quot; &quot; &quot; another Twitter user in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; w@@ ow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let us all look like rac@@ ists . # ang@@ led .
&quot; &quot; &quot; short time later , Scott Rus@@ sel , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment has been broadcast about a swimming performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wording , we are sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of more than 90 times , C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the people who responded to the B@@ emer@@ kt via Twitter
the comm@@ ent@@ ator Scott Rus@@ sel had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze on Mac@@ Donald &apos;s name
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had compl@@ ained about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and gave a message .
we regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible that they will be broadcast .
yesterday night we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers at the show and our fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ n in the social media .
to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ on &apos;s comments relate to the performance of the swi@@ mm@@ ers and not to them as a person .
nevertheless they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ happy formulation . B@@ yr@@ on does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald was ap@@ olog@@ ying in the mission and tried to justify his re@@ mark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made at the Women &apos;s Pool in C@@ BC , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have referred to the performance of the swi@@ mm@@ ers and not to them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , no dis@@ regard was inten@@ tional and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark ou@@ trag@@ ed about Frau , who tried in the middle of the shop sham@@ eless under@@ wear
the buyers did not know where to look when a woman pulled her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mor@@ dial to try sau@@ c@@ ers .
in order to wor@@ sen the situation , she mu@@ stered , as she looked at it , drew her out and put her back into the shelf .
she continued to browse and rehear@@ sed four pairs of bri@@ efs in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping m@@ all in Folk@@ estone where the woman rehear@@ sed the pants before putting them back into the shelf
a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ d@@ son , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman tried under@@ wear , she went back and left the business without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area , she picked up a pair of pants from the lay @-@ out , pulled out her own tr@@ ump trousers and trousers and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a somewhat discre@@ et place to do it - she was simply there , che@@ ek@@ y like Osk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when they pulled out the pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as they put them back into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three more bri@@ efs , before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything to ign@@ ite and went out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to inter@@ fere with anyone observing - or thinking about the person who would possibly buy the pants that she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 who lives in K@@ ent said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how resistant to think that someone would take shelter that had another person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I got along , the employees tried to pull the garments out of the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of pants and find out that another woman had her and went out and had not been washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a Pri@@ mark spokes@@ man said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday , August 9 at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products in question have been removed from the sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a in front of weapons attack
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail.com could make it safer for you .
we spoke with Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Ver@@ ban@@ des in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at the close distance .
regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to rot@@ ate the sk@@ ewer for your pre@@ dat@@ or .
if you are approaching from behind you should turn around as first , so that you can see your att@@ acker and &quot; go out of the shot , &quot; Miz@@ ra@@ chi says .
then grab the gun between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before you face it with your free el@@ bow .
then hit him with the knee in the bar and twi@@ sts , while the att@@ acker is squ@@ ee@@ zed from pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the run to the face and move back@@ wards while holding the gun on him .
for att@@ ackers who approach from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot , grab the gun and twist them so that the att@@ acker cannot shoot .
at the same time store the weight on your gun and beat the att@@ acker on your chest , then turn the gun from its grip , before moving back@@ wards and directed the gun to it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that with a rob@@ ber@@ y it is the saf@@ est to submit your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sch@@ ab@@ t for a travel guide his tongue to the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ went his immune system and stran@@ gle@@ hold of a serious test by le@@ aking some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k sho@@ ok his course on a Euro bills , a rail@@ ing at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a r@@ ins@@ ing button on a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resistance of his immune system .
before emp@@ t@@ ying any object he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and us what he is going to do .
but the experiment , which was fil@@ med under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight .
the thought to strip the fl@@ ushing button of a traction toilet , which was already used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately nothing left what he del@@ ights , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right became known to test the res@@ ili@@ ence of his intest@@ ines by travelling through the world and ate peculi@@ ar and wonderful things .
from public rail@@ ways to railway stations to r@@ ins@@ ing kno@@ bs of toilets , the task placed his immune system definitely under a rehear@@ sal
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he told : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film , he was able to do justice to his call .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its sample score showed a lumin@@ ance of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ ating number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to refuse after their l@@ umin@@ ating number was over 4000 units while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. W@@ right and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria at different places like the bathroom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this comes close to the worst thing I &apos;ve done in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more dirt than that !
I &apos;m not going to lick here because it &apos;s disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products .
the company provides Mr W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories Nik@@ o Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to see and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we conducted crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended that we said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let us call Ian &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary , we were able to provide the consumer with more information in an interesting way .
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film direc@@ ting , added : &quot; let me tell me so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tast@@ ed some of the things I had ordered him to lick , just like the ec@@ el@@ usive Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things where it was easier to get Ian to lick her and others , in which this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o , 84 per cent of all respon@@ dents of lac@@ tic acid bacteria associated with the well @-@ being of the stomach and the intest@@ ines and 58 percent said they might at least occasionally use products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ zi@@ al family destroyed before del@@ og@@ ation of social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
a as@@ o@@ zi@@ al family left her social housing after a del@@ og@@ ation with a damage of £ 50,000 because she had terr@@ orized her neigh@@ bors .
after a long list of complaints from her estate , T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown into S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after being removed from their property , employees of the housing association found their property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls showed aff@@ licted holes , wooden boards were ri@@ pped , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls .
the family were res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that they are now living in a private accommodation
Donn@@ a Mc@@ E@@ vo@@ y , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall Housing , said she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider since this property is pres@@ um@@ ably considered as not so beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is too .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had added , street fighting with bas@@ eb@@ all sl@@ ats , in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation of residents , drug abuse , drug traff@@ icking and excessive cri@@ es , stri@@ des and flu@@ kes included .
Skel@@ by , 47 whose name was on the lease , received an arrangement for anti @-@ social behaviour in June .
in some rooms of the house which may be torn down , old gar@@ bage has been found
in the estate where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wood @-@ pra@@ w@@ ns were ri@@ pped up
neigh@@ bors said they saw them fighting on the streets and regularly calling the police
Corn@@ wall Housing del@@ og@@ ated her and her partner this week by the property after giving them an extended term of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ og@@ ation were che@@ ered by lighten@@ ed neighbours who said that their lives were made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They were not afraid of anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this morning we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
now , when they finally are gone , it will be nice .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said it would have agreed to cooperate with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called regular intervals for 20 years
on the over@@ grown site of the community house , gar@@ bage and old toys were thrown down
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dis@@ grace that the ten@@ ant has agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family , since a del@@ og@@ ation is always the last step to consider Corn@@ wall Housing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case , because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be dre@@ ad@@ ful for their neigh@@ bors .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the Devon and Corn@@ wall police and members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously assigned to us and have given us the information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development will give con@@ sol@@ ation to some neighbours and the message convey@@ s that anti @-@ social behaviour will not be toler@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress , which is left in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ og@@ ation on the floor .
workers of the property management will now have to waste gar@@ bage mountains that surround the house
in 2014 , the police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as bal@@ ances , par@@ ap@@ her@@ nia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ by received a fine @-@ term penalty after the possession of a drug of class B was found guilty of trading .
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ by , who came to life in 2013 .
after having been without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many room walls of the house were engra@@ ved with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that she will del@@ og@@ ate ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules
Angela C@@ row from the Devon and Corn@@ wall police told that the del@@ og@@ ation was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can behave themselves without self @-@ repro@@ aches as well as to those who have been har@@ med by such a behavior , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal in panic after an open military jet over@@ flies
sun an@@ bet@@ ers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
a port@@ ug@@ isi@@ es@@ ches P @-@ 3C Ori@@ on aircraft of the air forces placed an unbeliev@@ able storm flight
the air forces stated that it was on a training flight but insi@@ sted that there was no risk of safety
this was the moment in which sc@@ ary tourists start to panic after an open jet pl@@ ung@@ ed over a full beach .
dramatic video recordings showed how the military plane fle@@ w almost in tan@@ gible proximity to the sun an@@ nex@@ es on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers jump@@ ed when they started to worry about the noise of the jet engines without seeing what was coming to them through the clouds .
the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ists who posted videos about the dramatic fly @-@ by in the social media , said : &quot; it just fle@@ w past twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ uno Arro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling down on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at Av@@ eiro &apos;s beach were displac@@ ed in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and unbeliev@@ ably deeply fle@@ w
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3C Ori@@ on air@@ plane was on a training flight to identify fisher@@ boats in front of the coast and flying so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the spokes@@ man said that the jet , due to the bad visibility , fle@@ w somewhat deeper than usual due to the poor visibility , but the air forces insi@@ sted that safety was at no risk at all .
the area fires have destroyed this summer parts of the mainland Portugal , where also four people came to death on the island of Madeira .
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot had to fly so deeply due to the conditions - strong fog and fire - that limits his view .

Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with car@@ es against Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - FC Barcelona fights on Sunday for the first step towards the first title win in the new soccer season .
the Catal@@ ans compete in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup against the FC Sevilla , the withdrawal is three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the dou@@ ble@@ w@@ inner must ren@@ ounce the tournament with the under@@ stated Cup@@ fin@@ alist and reig@@ ning Europa League Champion among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who den@@ ies the Olympic football tournament with Brazil .
also , Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andre ter St@@ egen is also missing .
the German suffered a change in the knee in the training , with which the demand for bar@@ ca at least was clari@@ fied in favour of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen in Barcelona have been awarded the status as number one for two years .
coach Luis En@@ rique has so far ren@@ ounced a clear decision and left bra@@ vo in the le@@ ague , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most other cont@@ ests will have the effect .
before the first mandatory match of the new season , there is doubt about the team &apos;s fitness status , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 .
also at 3 : 2 in the Pro@@ pos@@ al stop against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. did not really convince .
Sev@@ ille , in turn , has to di@@ gest the 2 : 3 defeat after extension in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves for the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
with up to now , Barcelona has eleven successes of the record winner in this Candi@@ date .
mA Long in a separate le@@ ague for table tennis gold
Rio de Jan@@ eiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic winner .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his fellow country@@ man and &quot; title def@@ ender &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12.@@ 5@@ 4.4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Jan@@ eiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World R@@ ank@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Golden Grand Sl@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; won the World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ als and just Olympia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Jun Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it as expected in the final game and made the title out of each other .
it was clear that for the third time a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five Rings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top Olympic Tre@@ pp@@ chen was the former S@@ VS @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Leg@@ ion@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
mA and Z@@ hang were left alone on the disk , between sentences and time @-@ outs , they had no co@@ aches .
they had with@@ drawn to the tri@@ b@@ une and left their prot@@ ectors in a fair competition alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the matches up to here I played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the finale I play for myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang had said fol@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game posed gold and silver med@@ alli@@ sts with the China flag .
the match itself was unexpected one @-@ sided .
mA had really to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first sentence .
after that he set the pace on the record and left Z@@ hang since only a total of 13 points .
through the su@@ peri@@ ority of Ma developed not the anticipated stir@@ ring match .
nevertheless , nevertheless , there were enough breath @-@ taking ball@@ changes to be seen .
Miz@@ ut@@ ani won the game around bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in his quarter @-@ final against the German European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the White @-@ Russian had drawn a ri@@ b injury , was then in medical treatment , had to settle &quot; in the end &quot; with sheet metal .
the Sweden Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Pers@@ son ( 42 / 2008 ) have become a similarly high table tennis table Olympia @-@ V@@ ierte .
Donald Tr@@ ump adm@@ its &quot; huge problems &quot; in the election campaign
the leadership of the US Rep@@ ublic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive wor@@ ries , even in traditional conservative states .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has now revealed weaknesses of his election campaign in the current republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old Ut@@ ah .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire expressed such concerns as correspon@@ dents reported .
having cast 16 ri@@ vals within the own republi@@ can camp from the race , the doubts are now growing in the fight for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have huge problems in Ut@@ ah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump in front of evangel@@ ical Christians , asking for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
gu@@ ilt is false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he res@@ umed his famous media sh@@ ud@@ d@@ les again .
Republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds cr@@ acking
Ut@@ ah is usually a secure bank for rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ USA in June , Tr@@ ump and his opponent from the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , were alike .
other institutions see Tr@@ ump in front , but not by the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state .
Arizona and Georgia are regarded as endangered as well .
in an interview from the Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC Tr@@ ump rep@@ lied to the question how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; just as I did before . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if afterwards : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either succeed , or I will make a very very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does nothing else than telling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it does not suff@@ ice for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , that is ok , said Tr@@ ump further .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the Party should have threatened to submit funds to support his election campaign , he should not be able to present better read@@ ings .
instead of that , the candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans would be stronger in the arms of the Congress .
Olympics : triple Sc@@ am on Dop@@ ing Test
the I@@ OC wants to set up a disciplinary commission .
Kenya &apos;s athletes face the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Jan@@ eiro &apos;s Olympic Games .
after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya has sent a trainer home .
the International Olympic Committee decided to immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function@@ arian said that the former Spr@@ inter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave birth to a pri@@ mal specimen in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich .
this was reported by the team@@ leader Ken@@ ias from the dop@@ ing control systems .
the IA@@ AF World Federation initiated the I@@ OC for information about the case in order to exac@@ erb@@ ate their own investigations , divided an IA@@ AF speaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the I@@ OC , IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in an IA@@ AF Declaration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and presented himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , rehear@@ sed and signed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Ken@@ ias chef de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was in possession of the accredi@@ tation of the ath@@ l@@ ete who stood on the list for the training controls of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich was in 2015 in Beijing WM fourth over 800 meters .
four days earlier , Ken@@ yan &apos;s Ath@@ le@@ tics Military Movement , Michael Rot@@ ich , had been de@@ duc@@ ted from the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed about forth@@ coming dop@@ ing tests against cash payments of his country .
according to media reports , he was arrested at his return at the Nairobi airport .
in Kenya , after numerous dop@@ ing trials in Kenya , Kenya has been under special observation for a long time .
in the announcement of more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls submitted by the I@@ OC prior to Rio Games , it has been noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are being targeted .
the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer Olympics to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the beginning of the Olympics .
in consequence WA@@ DA Kenya from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing fight con@@ form with the rules of WA@@ DA are .
Kenya is regarded as a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of TV reports of the ARD , accus@@ ations were repeated over and over again , that dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible in Kenya and there is a considerable ment@@ ality of sports bet@@ ting .
I@@ OC member Richard Po@@ und recently requested a similar investigation into Kenya as he had hired her in the Russian athle@@ tics .
in doing so , it could be proven that in this kind of sport , nation@@ wide and systematically ged@@ opt .
Russian athletes were subsequently excluded from the summer games .
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
in Shakespeare &apos;s year , the Salzburger Fest@@ spiele present the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a trag@@ ic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with it a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s master@@ piece .
the artistic director , Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled a youth room with the role of Mary .
in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o D@@ ud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he exu@@ des .
we always say that she is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and mel@@ ody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
in this st@@ aging Bart@@ oli plays an older one .
she rec@@ alls with melanch@@ oly to her love with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
firstly because it is musi@@ cally extraordinary !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
it is wise , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passi@@ on@@ ately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is very similar to me , my Italian character I as Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laugh@@ s Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is such an honor for us to work with it .
it is a tremend@@ ously generous human being .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is such an exceptional artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in each of his movements , in his views , it &apos;s his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheer@@ ful approach to life , this is very important at all !

London school girls , which joined the IS , was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school girls who left London last year to join the IS , report@@ edly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that a few weeks ago her family learned from her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , IT@@ V news reported on Thursday .
Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and died , according to her family , shortly after she pret@@ ended to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good is in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - people think of ever making this decision , &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e .
in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school girls from the east of London embar@@ ked on an air@@ plane in the direction of Turkey and then sent a bus to the Syrian border .
Sult@@ anas family was informed that she had married an I@@ SIS milit@@ ant in Syria - and within a few months she became a wi@@ dow .
Rei@@ d says , Clinton will stay in the case of an election victory in Gar@@ land as candidate for the Supreme Court
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of democr@@ ats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton will nom@@ inate the Jud@@ ge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ land &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority @-@ leader in the Sen@@ at Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ nell is the opinion that the next president will ap@@ point the successor of the de@@ ceased Jud@@ ge at the Supreme Court of Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects from Clinton to select Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ person from Rei@@ d later said he had not talked with Clinton whether she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and spec@@ ulate .
he praised Gar@@ land and said , Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the top judge for the US App@@ ell@@ ation Court for the District of Columbia .
RAID said Rep@@ ublic@@ ans blocked the Guard nom@@ ination , be lack@@ eys and hel@@ per workers of Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump .
he also stated that Donald Tr@@ ump is un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tre@@ ats wants nude calendar for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women and for men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine is working with the photographer David BEL@@ LE@@ MER@@ E to bring out a 1970 &apos;s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired Calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses calendar for 2017 .
the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his nude magazine distingu@@ ishes from Old@@ school Play@@ boys as &quot; Play@@ boy for Men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he is the view that it does the Calendar too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to return to depic@@ t timeless and classic n@@ udi@@ ty in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release to publish the calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their pictures online or in person at an open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kur@@ dish community reck@@ ons with mass @-@ cur@@ sed
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he who does not adapt to Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Pres@@ idency of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kur@@ dish community of Germany calcul@@ ates short @-@ term with tens of thousands of people who escape from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , it could even be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the pres@@ elected president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the harsh incident of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ dish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with several hundred thousand prot@@ ectors from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the chairman Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government has already passed months of Kur@@ dish bur@@ gh@@ olds with sanctions , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds are on the run in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the ins@@ ul@@ ting put@@ sch , sec@@ ular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Tur@@ ks were added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to restart in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that takes refugees itself is producing refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the band@@ leader accused the targeted settlement of Syrian Arab@@ s in Kur@@ dish , but also in Alexand@@ rian cities .
that is why Erdo@@ gan hopes to increase the amount of out@@ liers to the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been wi@@ ped out in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the band leader demanded that the federal government positions itself as sharp@@ ly as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also in Germany there is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wit@@ ch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan cri@@ tic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the past few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also feared the escape of many Tur@@ ks abroad .
more Tur@@ ks are looking for asylum in Germany , above all Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the Brand@@ marking as a Gü@@ len @-@ trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other acade@@ mics the professional existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he who does not adapt to Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and Sä@@ kul@@ aren , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ Nah@@ Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as reported by the newspaper , calling on numbers of the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Tur@@ ks already set up the largest group of asylum @-@ holders recognized for political persecution in Germany before the coup .
on June 30 , this was 11,@@ 386 people , and thus almost 29 percent of all ( 39.@@ 625 ) were eligible for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this survey , there is no wage against war , poverty or lack of perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
asylum rights according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from state @-@ side , individual persec@@ uted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals won &apos;t receive anything from the summer campaign - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia may not choose the parliament .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , they have understood .
in 2021 the country election will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
because stup@@ id than so far it is not about : summer holidays , heat and landscape @-@ competition - that bit@@ es .
the locals , who are to be convinced by the elec@@ toral fighters , are on vacation .
most of the vac@@ ation@@ ists who are in the land , on Us@@ edom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not local , so are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
there are practical problems : during the holidays , hel@@ pers , the posters , infl@@ ate air bal@@ lo@@ ons , fl@@ atten the fl@@ yers and count out voices in the end , only lab@@ ori@@ ously apply .
until 4 September 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass a campaign for an election victory shortly to the people over itself .
the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in p@@ olls .
what is exciting is how badly Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D is cutting off and what remains at the end of the coalition @-@ aug@@ ust .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous acting election campaign , one sees from his big posters .
he travels through the countryside , distri@@ butes ro@@ ses and ch@@ ats a little with the people , just as his legendary predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff also did .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , coun@@ sel@@ ing has cold feet and Chancellor Merkel gives blame for the blo@@ oming of Af@@ D . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acceler@@ ates the rise of the pop@@ uli@@ sts which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its Spitz@@ enk@@ andi@@ daten , the Minister of the Interior , Lorenz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is to make election campaigns at the right time at the wrong time .
she invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale document@@ ations ; Merkel &apos;s constitu@@ ency @-@ circle is located in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not vote , there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s a p@@ ity to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
apart from that , the Nor@@ theast @-@ CD@@ U largely wai@@ ves the usual election campaigns at market places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbrellas and bal@@ lo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that , says Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union also noted that you are br@@ ushing the base on the land that it must be very tight again to find a wire to the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are on the left side , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : barely present in the expan@@ se of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Council of the CD@@ U election figh@@ ter Kok@@ ert on his comrades is also self @-@ reve@@ aling : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must go where it hurt , namely where the people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , E@@ birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called its SPD to a particularly committed election campaign .
in surveys , the social democr@@ ats stood at least 22 percent behind the CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just shortly before Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the election of 2011 the SPD had won yet another 35.@@ 6 percent ahead of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , small @-@ party with seven percent in the surveys , should make the leap into the Parliament &apos;s parliament .
they make a modern virtue out of their holiday @-@ need and put up their election campaign largely on the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it calls the chairman Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , green campaig@@ ners go on track search for local stimul@@ ants among holi@@ day@@ makers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Silke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ t just with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg Lake and still finds it beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elec@@ toral holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Rehabilitation : restaurants suffer from block@@ age
at the speed , with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ it@@ ated there is nothing to compl@@ ain about .
for those responsible for the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and end only at 8 pm , there are all praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have done everything quite sh@@ ak@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff tells of the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is also no delay .
the construction site could be rel@@ oc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything will be ready .
the de@@ valu@@ ation of those responsible for the construction work will also be praised , for instance when it comes to setting up residence hous@@ ings .
since the construction site was mig@@ rated to the south on Monday and also the locking of the asphalt road in O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ tenburg is restored , the traffic situation within the village has relaxed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; citizens can now exit from O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen from the B 27 on both sides . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ev@@ asion through the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were some considerable complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the dep@@ uty head director Florian King responsible for the technical management of the refur@@ bish@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inhabitants of Bach@@ strasse , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many cre@@ eping paths were looking and more familiar to their nav@@ i than the sign@@ age .
what led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas were fran@@ ch@@ ising .
as the speed limits were not met , the municipality also called for the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were considerable transgres@@ sions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who himself made himself aware of the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are already two to three per minute .
the fastest was on the road with 77 ho@@ ur@@ ly kilometers in the Tempo @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has been moved , however , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg the road is open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but that the B 27 refur@@ bish@@ ment has led to sales breaks , everyone can look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
anyone who has less to do with the &quot; end customer , &quot; i.e. for other companies , has hardly any consequences for the rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also at the deal@@ ers@@ hip Mai@@ er Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most slight drop &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also adm@@ its that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most powerful are the locals along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have made it tough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they lack@@ ed the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil .
we have to be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the revenue loss is attri@@ but@@ able to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far above 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; street marking has dropped its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half of his employees have to dism@@ iss him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismis@@ sed , politics would have responded differently .
instead , government President Jörg Schmidt respon@@ ds to a request from G@@ öh@@ ner , whether it could give a financial compensation , otherwise the restaurant benef@@ ited from the advantages of the location at the B 27 . now , they must also bear the draw@@ backs that result from the rehabilitation .
G@@ Ö@@ H@@ NER knows from other coun@@ ties , where something more generous has been handled .
with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue .
after all , the family business has been here since 17@@ 15 , pointing to the long history .
that other regular guests are now less frequ@@ ented because of the complicated traffic management , he can understand .
if you cannot come here , it is also somewhere else nice .
that his tri@@ bal climate comes back after the end of the renovation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt .
despite the crises with BSE and avian influ@@ enza , G@@ öh@@ ner thinks the effects of the B 27 construction work on its client@@ ele for the biggest crisis that its host@@ ess experienced in its many years of history .
six months of construction work , that is already brutal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constantly , in the name of the fight against terror , laws are screw@@ ed up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
following the latest proposals , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère will now introduce a big security package .
but what has a status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the conc@@ ession .
all his proposals were politically acceptable to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior at the presentation of his new security package .
they do not overwhel@@ m anybody .
other , additional points would first be discussed within the parties .
I also take part in it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as Minister of the Interior , he was placed on results and on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ cover@@ able con@@ sensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère took a little time before he presents his conclusions for the safety of the Republic .
but these are all the more extensive .
some have already been announced , announced , announced : that a new security authority is to take care of the un@@ encrypted communication is not new .
not the fact that Germany must implement several EU regulations on passenger data and weapons law .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is not surprising .
in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère will start a second attempt to make proposals that have not been made with the SPD so far : he wants to recru@@ it sympathy for terrorist groups and kno@@ ck out ji@@ ha@@ dist@@ s with a double citizenship of the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U man adm@@ its . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still considers this to be reasonable and does not demand anything that doesn &apos;t have any chances in the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ist anyway .
a few new ideas also present de Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
they have partly in themselves : he plans fast procedures for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ention of people before deport@@ ation .
refugees who are targeted at the country should first check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security check .
for asylum seek@@ ers for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse than until now - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw off their papers to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of this is political and legal .
man@@ ches also works un@@ expect@@ edly and leaves any questions un@@ answered .
and with some points - in the im@@ balance of patient people for example - the question arises : what does this actually have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the issues of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be said that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
in addition , many people were worried about security in the face of the high number of refugees .
and things that people pro@@ found@@ ly occupied were not allowed to cling to election hours .
the inner security has moved enorm@@ ously into the focus .
only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are election campaigns .
with regard to internal security , the Union and the SPD are increasingly being put into place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days , the two parties came up high . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a gar@@ chy argument about the equipment of the Federal Police , then a security @-@ policy ideas collection of some Uni@@ ons Interior Ministers , in which the R@@ ess@@ ort@@ ch@@ efs also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a revers@@ al from the dual citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also blos@@ som@@ ing here for con@@ cili@@ atory sounds .
from a return from the double pass , he thinks nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been talking about the discussion in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to rel@@ inqu@@ ish them is not meaningful .
and in case of a bur@@ ka ban , he had constitutional concerns .
whether its own package is constitutional and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , it has yet to show itself .
there is a lot of things that could cause conflict .
but even the SPD is currently trying to pro@@ position itself on the subject of internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; parties chief Sig@@ mar Gabriel once again sign@@ aled the willingness to talk and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to enhancing security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

despite the diesel sc@@ andal , ex@@ tradition figures rise worldwide .
but it is not in all markets .
in the recall action , there are ver@@ teb@@ ras around a term .
Volkswagen starts ship@@ ments to the second half of the year .
despite the diesel @-@ setting , Europe &apos;s biggest fre@@ ew@@ ard can continue to demonstrate a plus despite the diesel @-@ powered industry thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
but in July the core brand was weak@@ ening especially in Western Europe and thus res@@ umed the total sale , as the company listed in D@@ ax .
in July , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent less cars than in the previous year with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month .
in the home market Germany the deliveries declined by almost one sixth .
sales manager Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July , above all , to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some core markets , it has given a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic framework &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around Turkey &apos;s coup attempt in Turkey , British vot@@ ers also stressed the exit from the EU , explained a spokes@@ person .
in the USA , where the exhaust @-@ arms first escal@@ ated , there is also a minus in be@@ ech .
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the most affected domestic trademark of the Lower Saxony is still lightly sum@@ p@@ tu@@ ous by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months only an ex@@ tradition minus of 0.9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is found .
from January to July , group sales chief Fred Kap@@ pler was able to advance sales plans .
in this period , Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles worldwide , 5,@@ 904 million .
Volkswagen had tam@@ per@@ ed with a software exhaust .
in Germany alone VW calls around 2.5 million cars for retro@@ fitting to the workshops .
in the course of the retro@@ fitting , VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars did not have any negative effects .
after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the coach station makes the customer a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate after the conversion , but does not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was in business circles on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is legal fin@@ eness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen is now offering its German customers a guarantee for sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday .
the Ministry of Transport has been confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fulfilled the conditions of my inquiry commission and KBA fully . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; devi@@ ations from these are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Federal Minister of Transport , Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the Ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has taken over the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance will not take place after the retro@@ fitting and all the relevant vehicle values have remained unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was named in business circles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen will see the possibility that customers for example will come into a workshop half a year after conversion - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in customer interest , it is important to avoid that there are any other damages that have nothing to do with the Ab@@ g@@ ass@@ K@@ andal , to prevent uncertainty in terms of possible warranty arrangements as it was called . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposit accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German banks speaks of a single case and there is no signal in it : normal savings would have to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not afraid to pay for their as@@ cen@@ tive pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
banks money transfer money over night by the European Central Bank ( EC@@ B ) , they have to pay their 0.4 per cent penalty .
this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros on gi@@ ro@@ - or daily money accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 will now cost 400 euros a year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has been protecting 40 million euros for some time , which could be lifted from one day to the other and which he cannot analyse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the central bank account and generate 0.4 percent costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t lay down for every million 4000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost is now forwar@@ ded according to the poll@@ uter @-@ pays principle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just leaving the cash in the v@@ aults of the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four fail@@ ures , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ban@@ ker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most customers would have understanding and changed to other forms of investment .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Gen@@ ossen@@ schafts@@ verband Bayern stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the EC@@ B causes considerable costs for all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to carry it alone , be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically not possible &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their charges for account management , credit cards or transfers .
with pen@@ alties for deposits from three million Euros , the Thuring@@ ian Volks@@ s- und Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had head@@ lines with their skat@@ eboard stores in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Michael Kem@@ mer , Chief Executive Officer of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nation@@ wide loans for deposits , and the competition in Germany is much too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said , at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a client@@ ele that is a bit lav@@ ish from the property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they hat@@ ch for free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gen@@ ossen@@ schafts@@ verband Bayern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are currently no other banks known to calculate a substitute for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ person Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Federation of German B@@ anks and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banks ( Bv@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into the neg@@ atives against the private customer is very , very high . &quot;
competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the migration of investors to compete .
the customers in Germany will not be able to please this in width .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
lon@@ ely men middle aged love records .
before you hur@@ ry to the comment section to so@@ w him under the p@@ seud@@ onym of non @-@ all@@ ele men &apos;s accompli@@ sh@@ ments , this statement deri@@ ves from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the much @-@ discussed resur@@ gence of vinyl records is not attri@@ but@@ able to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that want to welcome the new@@ ness of physical objects , but to mid@@ life no@@ stal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record are all fores@@ ight in the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely buyers group .
there is also no hor@@ des by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers retain their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
if this blog would be a news report on TV , I would follow the camera while in the middle of a busy street in S@@ oho , a modest gray suit , and wild , before I ste@@ al , hold my hands and something determining like : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of So@@ hos is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there is still a hand@@ ful of fantastic panel @-@ specialty shops .
I would probably ask the cam@@ eram@@ an to switch the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glas@@ gow , 55 , I of Si@@ ster Ray ( number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( numbers : eight men middle age , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I guess already , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by email , I did not follow him home ) , dress up the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford than they appeared and buy objects he sold when he was young and pl@@ ain@@ ly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60 &apos;s , early 70 &apos;s , who appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things in which I probably was too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agre@@ es that those who buy records , are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and add : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much .
this is my disaster .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers , whom he meets , apply to You@@ Go@@ v &apos;s profile .
he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and have seen themselves to buy their old records .
from the conversations I conducted , people generally emp@@ tied themselves around 1998 or 1999 of their collection .
customers who once sold their records in order to buy CDs , sell their CDs now to buy their records , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom of tra@@ ilers of the record audi@@ tor of a particular age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of records ?
it takes only a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offer a so@@ o@@ thing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers were imp@@ acting the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to pull back to the stability of familiar vinyl records , from objects that evoke happy youth memories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a emp@@ t@@ iness or possession of material poss@@ essions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector so and I think it &apos;s like that with many people .
it is a simple way of being mentally engaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a staff of a record pile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey by the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month have not yet heard them .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use while 7 % of those who buy a record , do not possess a record player .
at this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried , while I was more bl@@ ur@@ red by a pile of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ vals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone came here recently and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a radio @-@ board sound plate so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less musi@@ cally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones who only slowly come into being .
whi@@ p that has dedicated the Schall@@ platten to almost a whole floor has a colorful audience when I go .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age and middle @-@ aged women .
even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts &apos;s latest syn@@ thesizer and sex@@ e @-@ packed pop instead of experimental jazz p@@ amper@@ ed from the speakers - it &apos;s good to see such diversity with the customers .
none of them looks very lon@@ ely , but nag@@ ging psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are hard to imagine , if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates for sale .
it rather makes a shopping spre@@ e as a big shopping .
she does not earn much , therefore collecting sheets is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records ... &quot; she drives with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record enthusiasts : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I pret@@ end to be brave the je@@ ans @-@ leather pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who group for a moment to group Polar@@ oid cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a cross @-@ board player .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of tiles from Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential panels for an average collection .
nobody can see them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative , some so far up that it is impossible to touch them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is pure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plate art &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of So@@ hos for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as sheets .
although my research expl@@ ores that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , they are not considered , at least in record stores in S@@ oho , the large number of female collectors , who exist in reality , record stores and online forums .
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
they will certainly not spend their Thursday morning with the ram@@ ble through plates of the Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates while they avoid the star@@ ing ga@@ ze of an un@@ c@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false moder@@ ator , who rises above the shoulders nothing ins@@ ulating middle @-@ aged men .

French Court re@@ jects the offer of demoli@@ tion of shops in the jungle refugee camps
a French court rejected a proposal from the authorities in Calais , dozens of pro@@ visional shops and restaurants in the Calais Jung@@ le , where thousands of refugees live .
in case of a trial hearing this week , the authorities in Calais argu@@ ed that the state should be authorized to sell 72 temporary business in which people sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to energy drinks , sell , offer hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in pro@@ visional restaurants .
the Calais pre@@ f@@ ecture argu@@ ed that these places were to be broken down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and that harbor a risk of fire and san@@ itation .
humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals that are offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also stated that the pro@@ visional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the exp@@ ul@@ sion of people who run 72 pro@@ visional business , but admitted that the concerns of Calais &apos;s pre@@ f@@ ecture are &quot; absolutely comprehensi@@ ble . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that food stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than just to feed people who &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; live in extremely prec@@ ari@@ ous conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by the ra@@ ins was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café des Lag@@ ers , which is char@@ itable and 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as advice on asylum causes for hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the petition to preserve the kids &apos; café .
in a letter to the Guardian , it meant that the closing &quot; for these children would be a cat@@ astrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot;
the two help organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants appreciated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle of the jungle has risen to more than 9,@@ 000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new@@ com@@ ers over the summer .

he did not have an explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place at the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hon@@ estly say it &apos;s hard to comment on the time of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must quietly analyse the reasons for de@@ bac@@ le .
at the time @-@ driving cup in October in Qatar , Martin wanted to fight for the title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Trailer
Germany &apos;s R@@ aser has to adjust to the next generation speed sensor : in different federal states , among others in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , which should be especially effective over temp@@ os@@ ses .
the fut@@ ur@@ istic effective rein@@ forcement trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example at accidents , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on highway construction sites or to sanitary bridges with temporary clock poli@@ shing there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that the speed limit is observ@@ able .
but a permanent mobile design can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement Trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days with un@@ interrupted measurement operation , the case data is transferred enco@@ ded via a modem .
laser measurement technology enables all vehicles to be captured across multiple tracks simultaneously .
variable speed limits as well as drive @-@ through b@@ ans according to time , travel strips and vehicle class can also be monitored .
you can move the trailer according to manufacturer with any car with trailer hit@@ ch .
so that it is not easily cli@@ cked , it is lo@@ wered in the measurement mode so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and inci@@ dentally also disappear slip @-@ proof outer cover disappear .
in addition , a built @-@ in Al@@ ar@@ man@@ lage should protect the bl@@ itz from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to information from Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used .
foreign authorities also fl@@ ashing with the new technology : recently France has ordered 100 units after an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain holt Silver in 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold is catching up
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at 7 @-@ year @-@ old rug@@ by came to a ab@@ rupt halt in the final hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is on Thursday evening when they were struck with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ odoro Stadium in Rio .
Fi@@ ji passed a master class in handling , side @-@ qu@@ il@@ ting , push back , line run , and raw power to gain gold - its first Olympic gold med@@ al of any colour .
the defeat was defeated by the not too bad con@@ sol@@ ation price of the silver med@@ al - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back on them in the final .
but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji would have defeated a 15 @-@ man team in this form .
it might be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least one Brit@@ on tomorrow will have a gold med@@ al around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben Ryan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path behind it .
eight years ago she lost every game at the Adel@@ aide Sev@@ ens .
here they just lost one .
this fl@@ ap will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji started wonderfully and let the attacks of G@@ Bs boun@@ ce out of fun .
it felt for the captain Tom Mitch@@ ell and Co . an as if you were running in driving buses . the World Series winners went up 5 @-@ 0 to the top when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au was over@@ crowded .
with even four minutes of play , J@@ erry Tu@@ w@@ ai added another attack from the right corner .
12 @-@ 0 and UK barely touched the ball .
a fr@@ actions of Mitch@@ ell picked up the Berg of Man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa to score a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute , j@@ asa ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a l@@ ete a touch down in the right corner and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re@@ an@@ p@@ fi@@ ff and there was still over a minute of playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pressed through further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med down to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it is like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB is still st@@ oned .
this is how it is .
GB resulted in fundamental changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ anic gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the circumstances of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova passed through a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan N@@ ort@@ on started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went out for a long time in favor of the South Se@@ as whose fans were singing , p@@ aving flags and d@@ anced on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a Vi@@ li@@ ams put the i @-@ dot with another try in the last seconds .
the whi@@ stle t@@ apped , the Fi@@ j@@ is embrac@@ ed themselves and GB k@@ ick@@ ed devast@@ ating in the lawn .
earlier on the day , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain urged South Africa in a scar@@ ce semi @-@ final match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s conversion of difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the bo@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan N@@ ort@@ on broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scor@@ ed a gate under the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late Tac@@ kling by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the win - and thus the silver med@@ al .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the Cancer of the trainer to a ru@@ d@@ der victory
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ ined gold than with these games , and that is what they mean .
from the first ru@@ d@@ der to the last , 220 severe H@@ ieve going into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if there were only those who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all present when she came to the second Olympics in a row without a tax woman , the first women in the history of the British Sports who laid on such a scale .
her domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all her 39.@@ ter is un@@ moved , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant athletes sli@@ pping over the surface with the elegance of spon@@ ges , which does not reflect the nature of the triumph .
behind every gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make a difference to the incre@@ mental advances that make the difference and there was no more lifting than the trainer who didn &apos;t know 30 months ago , if he was diagnosed this day at all , when diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that did it .
if you do not , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a bit the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if that is the right term in such circumstances .
I needed money , so I needed to get better soon .
it was an incen@@ tive .
I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
this is how it starts .
rowing is a challenge , but it makes it a bigger one .
in the immedi@@ acy of the victory their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve w@@ aking up a little more than usual , trying to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ anning , which was the captain of the Royal Ar@@ till@@ ery Reg@@ iment in Afghanistan , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional w@@ reck this week . that is perhaps a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and also Robin worked .
it was three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning lost no race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents were not able to compete .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to catch up , p@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were very tr@@ apped at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; lead in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important to not get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking to make something great .
today , we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race what we did .
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV @-@ advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to conc@@ eive that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this feels so much better &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , is reti@@ ring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association counts as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exempl@@ ary exempl@@ ary &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water pur@@ port used as a model for the large water producers .
so before some time it was named in the original on a contribution of the Bavarian Radio .
little later the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia wor@@ shi@@ ped the purpose of the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as exempl@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this is Rupert G@@ öller , who was in the Zw@@ eck@@ verband employee for 31 years , of which 28 years as Managing Director .
now he was reti@@ ring at the age of 65 .
the pot@@ able water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe , based in K@@ ott@@ endorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , supports around 15@@ 0,000 cubic meters of water each year and supplies 32 localities and ham@@ lets with around 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
the municipalities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ bert , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ sbach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supplier contracts for further towns and municipalities .
the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ns Bürger@@ meister@@ in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Rupert G@@ öller was employed as a water keeper in 1985 and was appointed managing director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work through office and organizational activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as outstanding events , it called the inaugur@@ ation and inaugur@@ ation of the new well ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new well ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , restoration of the high container ( 1999 ) , the new acquisition of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the partial re@@ ductions of water pipes .
there was no stand@@ still and there was always new additions , because water was poll@@ uting and drinking water is the most important food .
in their lau@@ dation they praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers loyal , reliable and correct service over 31 years .
he has worked with a lot of heart blood for his water purpose and he regularly lived the water purpose association as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a true practitioner , he was allowed to present the successful concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe for nit@@ rate sin@@ king in front of the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district .
for this he received very much recognition and praise .
Rupert G@@ öller first praised Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best wat@@ erst@@ one and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlight from his point of view , he distinguished the fountain building and the restructuring of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the pi@@ pel@@ ines at the high tank at church lou@@ der on a 3rd of January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the towns could be supplied with water .
also the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained , because one filled the container from P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water ex@@ pe@@ dient was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who joined the successor of Rupert G@@ öller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko leaves the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have the courage to talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper &quot; Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a . &quot;
when the disease had been recognized by her son , she believed that she must die .
however , the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago was well ahead and now learn to be privately in New York , where there is the best therap@@ ists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give an example : if I ask him something about two years ago when I sang Scala in La Scala , he rec@@ alls nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he is the happ@@ i@@ est man on earth .
Ti@@ ago comes from Net@@ reb@@ ko &apos;s connection with the bass bar@@ it@@ one Erwin Schrot@@ t .
she is now married to the tenor Y@@ usi@@ f Ey@@ v@@ az@@ ov .
relationship between Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - Man goes wrong with li@@ fel@@ ess
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at 10.@@ 45 o &apos;clock in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( Stor@@ mar@@ n district ) and wounded her deadly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man inv@@ oked himself with us and stated to have shot his fellow @-@ wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a polic@@ eman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ r@@ ator is on the run , after him I am publicly flag@@ ged .
meanwhile nation@@ wide , because Sven S. could be on the road with the car .
the man is about 1.80 meters tall , mus@@ cular , brown @-@ fired and has a gl@@ at@@ ze .
in the meantime , the police have published a photo of him .
however , it is a few years old .
meanwhile the man carries a cat .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still bear the weapon , so the police .
anyone who sees Sven S. will call the 110 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim is born 1988 , the perpet@@ r@@ ator in 1981 .
the responsible police in Lübeck wanted to make no information about the case or the relationship between perpet@@ rat@@ ors and victims ; but it confirmed that a human being had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a child of killing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more we are not saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ person in Lübeck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to witnesses , a special service command ( SE@@ K ) was at the crime scene .
steel - Licht@@ blick for the German steel industry
the crisis @-@ driven and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in millions of millions .
financial bur@@ dens that are threatened by the industry from green electricity subsidies are from the table .
it remained in the release of the renewable energy revolution in the existing systems for the so @-@ called self @-@ current production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister of Agriculture Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission initially planned to ask the steel producers to use gases coming from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with competitive commis@@ s@@ ist Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators in the steel works are replaced , an E@@ EG lev@@ y of 20 percent is required .
but also this will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s unification with the European Commission for power generation .
thus the status qu@@ o of the previous regulation is largely determined .
the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have special significance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; Steel is future &apos; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the reform of emissions legislation , climate and employment targets are weigh@@ ed down , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity and a significant price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
last year , the situation continues to ag@@ grav@@ ate as the world &apos;s largest producer of China threw mass steel onto the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturers throw in Chinese steel conc@@ er@@ tos price dump@@ ing .
in the course of this spring , the situation has somewhat relaxed .
on the one hand , the import tari@@ ff has an impact on import steel , on the other hand the economic prospects in China have risen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is un@@ clear how sustain@@ ably the re@@ petition is . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ k@@ ru@@ pp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , the prices would have been stagn@@ ating again .
the industry re@@ acts to the difficult situation with further cost savings .
at last Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp did not want to excl@@ ude the closing of individual works .
in the German steel industry , around 86@@ 000 people were employed at the end of 2015 .
in July , the German steel producers remain cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
with 3.4 million tons , they produced a good six percent less cru@@ de steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the Wirtschafts@@ vereinigung Stahl reported on Friday .
after a short up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment in May the set lot went back for the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production is two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the coming months , the association expects an increase in order intake thanks to an improved order situation .
community , spirit , health : singing does sen@@ iors good
the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp for her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in the teacher &apos;s studies she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors @-@ choir .
&quot; singing is moving - emotional and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheer@@ ful , and a total of more living , she says .
at the same time , she does something good for her health and spirit .
for S@@ ingen is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German Seni@@ oren@@ liga .
most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
by regular cooperation , sen@@ iors can establish and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family structures solve in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organize , to be able to rely on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
for doing so , sen@@ iors exercise a deep and controlled respir@@ ation .
those who regularly demand their lungs are not so fast from the b@@ ust in everyday life .
even when it comes to getting the sound of voice at age , singing is an ideal hobby .
for elderly people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Foundation of the sen@@ iors organizations .
in the older generations , the joint singing had a much higher value ; it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure time , explains it .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in elderly people ar@@ ouses many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their adol@@ escence .
due to lyrics and especially melo@@ dies , people suffering from demen@@ tia are reli@@ eved of long depar@@ ting events .
in singing , a special power is required to the head , explains L@@ enz .
at the same time concentr@@ ating on one &apos;s own voice and a given rhythm and adap@@ ting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
especially elderly people who live alone practice so not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
self @-@ este@@ em is also growing through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I do something for a long time , I become better and grow beyond me - strengthen this experience .
good reasons to start singing , so there is enough .
those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks of having little talent , L@@ enz advis@@ es .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who h@@ ears when a sound goes wrong ?
in search of the right offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ t@@ ances in a sen@@ iors choir , one can simply join .
many cities also offer views over the choirs in the surrounding area .
those who want to sing in an ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ astic choir can contact the church or the church leaders directly .
many senior choirs can also be found via the internet .
if you don &apos;t have access to the Internet , the family , friends or neigh@@ bors can ask for help in the internet search .
if you want to sing , you should necessarily join a choir , rä@@ t H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to all ages .
cats react sensi@@ tively as hang@@ ers on scre@@ ams of k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hanover what effect the h@@ ops of cat @-@ bies have on adult animals .
to their surprise , the mi@@ str@@ ust did not leave the males cold - however , they kept in contrast with the females always the same .
female cats can recognize the exc@@ itation of k@@ itt@@ ens on the mi@@ sts of the little ones .
they react by ten percent faster to lu@@ te of k@@ itt@@ ens , who are in great need , as scientists have found out from the Tier@@ ärz@@ tlichen Hochschule and the Medical School of Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
K@@ ater also respon@@ ds to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - but always the same .
&quot; obviously , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ tig@@ ation of less and strongly arous@@ ed young for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; the Biolog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding said of the MH@@ H .
she is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology .
in a previous investigation the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the cat @-@ cri@@ es differ@@ ed with the ur@@ gency of their dependen@@ cy .
a total of nine adult males and eight boys were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a herd of little ones who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and were separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more strongly arous@@ ed k@@ itt@@ ens , who were additionally lifted up .
the researchers keep their results in spite of the small sample of meaningful results .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who had not yet own offspring , responded differently to the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned up faster to the speaker when this calls were playing the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may be alleged or develop@@ ped with the sex@@ ually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Biolog@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men to baby no@@ ises .
some studies showed that women re@@ acted more sensitive to inf@@ ants , no matter whether they were already mothers or not , the Biolog@@ in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks with &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey , Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r has been issued an arrest warran@@ t against the former soccer star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , Turkey takes place again an important soccer game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of Du@@ ell der Erz@@ riv@@ alen between B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
already with the sus@@ pic@@ ion of the emergency situation after the coup attempt in July , the government , the daily routine of ordinary citizens , should not be com@@ promised .
this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the attempted coup attempt .
even before football it is not stopped .
against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r , the Prosec@@ ution made an arrest warran@@ t .
accordingly , the addi@@ ct living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ kü@@ r is said to be supporters of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
although it is still valid for 90 days , the state of emergency is still valid until October , in fact , however , this does not affect the lives of most Tur@@ ks as well as no effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ni@@ ghtly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday for an end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &apos; club of B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as are traditionally not among friends of the president .
what the Gro@@ s of the Tur@@ ks , however , in view of dramatic experiences in history , is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans agree - whether their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be especially recommended for Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cologne in the past season proved its sporty value : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first season as top scor@@ er of his club .
in the final game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he achieved the 1 : 0 victory hit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FAN@@ ATI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he completed the season in an excellent way and secured his team the cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record champion found a con@@ cili@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the pre @-@ round kno@@ ck in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also played early in the Europa League .
it was only in sixth place in the S@@ enti@@ a Li@@ g .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we managed it and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as the year running was better .
above all thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who laid the foundation for the 14th title with 26 Sa@@ is@@ ont@@ eses as SÜ@@ PER @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ ment@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig .
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 year old .
in doing so , the only bor@@ row@@ ed Gom@@ ez left at the AC Florence after the coup attempt was announced , because of the political situation in the country after his EM @-@ holidays did not return .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he must say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; c@@ ited the specialist magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; club chief F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the stor@@ mer would have to be ready to ren@@ ounce about a third of his annual hardness equivalent to 7.5 million Euros , Or@@ man made clear : &quot; we cannot pay his sal@@ ary in Florence . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes have still med@@ al chances at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Jan@@ eiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa may not start in Rio .
other super@@ vised athle@@ tics sinn@@ ers can laugh about it - they fight in Rio for medals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; theme is still the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian swi@@ mmer Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ ova , who had compl@@ ained after a dop@@ ing lock her starting right shortly before the games , was pl@@ agu@@ ed and ext@@ ingu@@ ished at her start ( 100 meters of chest ) .
it offered a bizar@@ re scene : with a super@@ imposed smile she was still in the hall and prov@@ oked her appearance .
when it was certain that she wouldn &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a j@@ ub@@ led storm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there are many other sport@@ s@@ men who go to the start despite the Dop@@ ing Past at the Rio Olympics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
here is an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staffel / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversi@@ al figures in athle@@ tics .
he was closed two times for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since its inc@@ eption , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion runs even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is regarded as the biggest chall@@ enger of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staffel / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to sit down a six @-@ month lock in 2010 after taking the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after an operation she had strong tooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old def@@ ended herself .
Sandra P@@ erk@@ ovic ( disc@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the Olympic champion of 2012 , World Champion of 2013 and Europ@@ am@@ eister@@ schaft , had a positive effect on the b@@ anned stimulation of meth@@ yl hex@@ an@@ amin from 2010 to 2016 .
P@@ erk@@ ovic denied the in@@ quis@@ i@@ tive intake and was closed for six months .
the four broad@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the big gold @-@ fav@@ ori@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , had been positively tested and closed for 21 months in 2010 .
a remedy for penis enlargement was responsible , gro@@ unded mer@@ cen@@ sion .
this year , the 30 year old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ stein , Belarus ) : hardly an ath@@ l@@ ete was recognised as many medals afterwards .
so T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after he was as@@ cert@@ ained by Test@@ osterone Dop@@ ing .
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to leave Olympic Silver in 2004 due to ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM @-@ title in 2006 due to testosterone abuse .
the also recognized bronze med@@ al of the 2008 Olympic Games was returned to the CAS International Sports Court .
at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he ranks second in the world ranking .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world @-@ tre@@ ch@@ ord and gold @-@ fav@@ ori@@ tin was only tested positive in May but may still start in Rio .
in the 29 year old world champion , references to taking a forbidden dietary supplement have been found , the lock of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA was mild and ran on July 13 .
( Deutsch ) Bom@@ b@@ ent@@ error in Thailand - Austri@@ ans injured - Mehr@@ ere T@@ ote
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in touch with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she suffered cutting wounds and had been treated at the hospital , but I have already left it .
she planned her home trip for the beginning of September .
whether from the other explo@@ sions on the island of Ph@@ uk@@ et as well as in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he also Austrian citizens are still un@@ clear .
the State Department is in constant contact with local authorities , so Sn@@ ö@@ ll .
at about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in was first explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a quarter of two bom@@ bs .
according to the police , a Tha@@ il@@ änder@@ in was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Friday morning , two explo@@ sives came up again , and another man was killed , according to the authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also from Ph@@ uk@@ et , a bomb explosion was reported in the morning .
when det@@ on@@ ation near the beach resort Pat@@ ong popular among holi@@ day@@ makers , a taxi driver was injured after police instructions .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , which killed a municipal employee .
according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the prec@@ inct of the Co@@ ast@@ al Police .
finally , more det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ umph@@ on on the south @-@ east coast demanded several wounded .
from a connection to the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was named .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bom@@ b@@ ings carry the same manuscript , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said General Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee open @-@ day early journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is too early to express himself to possible motives - but it is probably the acts of Muslim rebels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the attacks of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks would not arise in connection with the Islam@@ ist insurrection movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ ot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather , one assumes that the bom@@ bs of opponents of the ruling military j@@ unta were laid .
in the past few days , the authorities would have received secret cl@@ ues for forth@@ coming attacks in the south of the country - however they were not informed about the exact time and the places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still be un@@ clear what group behind the attacks st@@ acks . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the attacks on Thursday and Friday occurred a few days after a controversi@@ al referendum on a Constitution issued by the military j@@ unta .
this gives the military great influence in the years to come .
Jun@@ ta head and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bom@@ bs had been an attempt to create chaos while the country was heading towards stability , improvement of economic situation and tourism .
the military j@@ unta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , keeps himself too good to bring the kingdom back to stability and order .
however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the u@@ prising of Muslim rebels for years in the extreme south of the country .
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok at an attack on a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the most bloody stroke of the recent history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is advised by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after several national offices , the constitutional prot@@ ectors in the Con@@ federation have also placed the group under observation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cl@@ ues for aspir@@ ations against liberal democratic principles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ assen , the German press agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , immigrants in Islamic faith or the Middle East are diff@@ am@@ aged in an extrem@@ ist way .
therefore we observe the movement as well .
the &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is opposed to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by est@@ ran@@ gement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional Gu@@ ards in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuring@@ ia - are already observing the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ arten said , his authority is closely coordinated with the state offices . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the Constitutional Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generally , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to talk to them with a you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the perpet@@ ual Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an adverti@@ sed advertising for your own thing .
the propaganda is meant to respond to people emoti@@ onally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
last but not least , there have been reports of contacts from the &quot; Identi@@ ty &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several federal states .
Ma@@ arten said , he did not know any knowledge .
for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species are only relevant from a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain people who are extrem@@ ist , change their direction and become so extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is whether such individuals have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recogni@@ zable .
with a view of the significant increase in legal crimes and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and asylum seek@@ ers , Ma@@ arten said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context .
but we have seen in recent years that there can be il@@ lic@@ istic structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ t@@ aler Group .
it may well be that further legal @-@ terrorism groups or small groups form the proposals for asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
but a Germany @-@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of legal @-@ terrorism is not recogni@@ zable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the previous groups have emerged at the regional level or in social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he expressed his concern that many tak@@ e@@ off@@ s went to the account of people who had not appeared before in the right scene before .
this is the wor@@ rying .
many of the susp@@ ects on asylum applications had previously not been known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed crimes committed by right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who were perhaps politically indiffer@@ ent or elected for example CD@@ U , SPD or left , which , however , have radic@@ alised themselves by far @-@ extrem@@ ist m@@ oods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
do not always determine the Olympic Games or World Records the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the cour@@ ageous performance by Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer games in Rio de Jan@@ eiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ weight swi@@ mmer from Ethiopia is so slow that it was no longer seen in the TV images .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cli@@ pping was chosen .
in social networks , Hab@@ te subsequently became the viral agent .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished with a reg@@ ression of 48 seconds and finished the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not just sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian received a special start @-@ up right from the international swimming pool .
this is distributed to make swimming in sub @-@ represented countries more well known .
as in Ethiopia most athletes run , I just wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the round .
some media called him &quot; Ro@@ bel der W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosperity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the English bou@@ levard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad Bo@@ d &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made fun of him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only hit a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 m Fre@@ estyle , played no role .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
during the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i provided media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Ä@@ qu@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete in a subur@@ b of 100 m Fre@@ estyle alone .
M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired up at the time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old lear@@ nt only eight months before Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

the Group plans to start trading with the transpor@@ ter shortly .
the mail wants to offer its electric transpor@@ ters from the coming year also on the free car market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to enter the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been checking for months whether they want to sell their self @-@ developed Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter with which letters and pack@@ ets are to be sold to other farms .
post board member Jürgen Ger@@ des had said , there is always promp@@ ting , for example by crafts@@ men .
according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group wants to enter the mass production of the vehicles shortly .
in the post @-@ own fabri@@ cation , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift .
Ger@@ des announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and in the long run a complete conversion to the environmentally friendly vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges its chief Matthias Hartmann .
the reg@@ res@@ sions suddenly came - but not surprisingly .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K lets the chair of Chief Executive Officer Matthias Hartmann all the more un@@ certain , the longer the successes promised by him remain .

the chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert has already been eliminated from the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September .
the management board of the Management Board already took over the previous board member Gerhard Haus@@ wir@@ inger on 1 September , distributed the company .
he will officially take over the function of a &quot; spokes@@ person &quot; until a successor was found for Hartmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a reason for the reg@@ ression , the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; differ@@ ing views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to long @-@ term business policy orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;

who will in future lead the market research firm is still un@@ clear at present .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in An@@ le@@ ger@@ reise , it was said on Friday , with the shareholders , finally , the dis@@ appointment of the continued success of the restructuring planned several years ago was great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Hartmann has been at the Gf@@ K @-@ Top since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen even after 5 years &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
given the latest bad Gf@@ K business figures , every participant will eventually become rest@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that were the case with BMW , that would also make the Qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after set@@ backs in the previous quarters , the company could not stop its loss of losses in the second quarter of 2016 .

accidents - Bus sli@@ ps in Krum@@ m@@ hör@@ n in Gr@@ aben : eight injured
on Thursday in Krum@@ m@@ hör@@ n ( district of Aur@@ ich ) , eight people were injured in an accident of a coach with 43 sen@@ iors .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , divided the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to her specifications , had to devi@@ ate from an opposite grid , who partly drove on the counter @-@ car .
the bus came to the right of the street and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , like a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Fire Brig@@ ade liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and emergency ambul@@ ances arrived at the accident site on Landes@@ straße 2 .
the last passengers were brought back from a regular bus back to the Krum@@ m@@ hör@@ ner district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators demanded the load experiences and possible witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cubic meter of waste are from October 1 , 2016 for the area of the Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ amp 3.@@ 44 instead of 2,10 euros ; for Zul@@ tenberg / Lin@@ denberg / Lop@@ p 3,@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 Euro ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the sew@@ age fee will be increased once more , if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a per@@ tin@@ ent calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , during the approval of the budget by the Kul@@ mb@@ ach country council , it was as@@ cert@@ ained that sub@@ divi@@ des were incurred for these wast@@ ewater facilities .
on the basis of legal basis , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the plants cost @-@ effectively .
as of 1 October 2016 , citizens and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ denberg and Zul@@ tenberg will have to reach deeper into the pur@@ ses .
the rate increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
like Herbert Schmidt , the Board of Directors , a new calculation of fees for the wast@@ ewater facilities of the market community was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ cover from the previous period of calculations may be compens@@ ated .
Schmidt started the serious inci@@ dence of charge in all three wast@@ ewater facilities in order to handle relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack , which lie between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
for example , due to the low distribution basis , for example expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious effect .
in addition , the wast@@ ewater volume in all three plants is slightly decl@@ ining .
in the previous period of the calculation , all three plants were not last noticed due to their age refur@@ bish@@ ment and repair expenses .
the facility in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the plants for Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ tenberg , Lin@@ denberg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years .
Schmidt pointed out that in the sew@@ age plant Az@@ endorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced because of damage .
in the pump station Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led and in the pond treatment plant Lop@@ p had to disp@@ ose of the first sew@@ age slu@@ dge after nearly 20 years of operation , the sew@@ age slu@@ dge had to be dispos@@ ed and an additional v@@ enting possibility will be installed in order to comply with the water legal requirements in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these extraordinary expenses came from continuing care and maintenance costs , which must be taken into account in the new period of calculations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which are still clearly below the current level in the years 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made it clear that at the low sew@@ age drop in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance were &quot; full . &quot;
in doing so , Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs with the sew@@ age plants has been spar@@ ed over the past 20 years .
the situation for the a@@ forem@@ en@@ tioned systems will continue to be prec@@ ari@@ ous according to stone houses in the long run , especially since one could not expand the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal wast@@ ewater industry association in order to not expand these facilities because it is a non @-@ author@@ it@@ ative facility .
Bulgaria beats for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero of October last year when positive 0.2 % were posted .
the average annual average of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0,2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0,2 % .
in July 2016 the following groups of consumer goods were observed compared to the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure time and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1,2 % ) ; different goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and foot@@ wear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
prices remained as in the previous month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as an Asian car@@ ic@@ ature critic@@ ises
Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say it is in@@ sensitive to bre@@ eds .
with its filtering tool , it allows for Snap@@ chat about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders on the absurd .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are unique , self @-@ supporting tools generating more than 30 million sel@@ fies per day .
all the ab@@ err@@ ations reach the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have drawn criticism in the past in which they were accused of promoting the App Black@@ face pump@@ ing or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week , some users suggested a filter that gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and dar@@ ker che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature from Asi@@ ans - &quot; Yellow @-@ face . &quot;
they wonder@@ ed if these repeated controversi@@ es were pointing to a bigger problem that the company has a diversity .
the news and ou@@ trage were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat , that it would have de@@ activated the feature .
the company was an exc@@ use : the filter was intended as a hom@@ age to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced rac@@ ism reminded the filter of inj@@ uri@@ ous c@@ lich@@ és .
others refused the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani wrote a Korean @-@ American art student , whose twe@@ et was widely spread over the photos that the filter was &quot; viol@@ ating and l@@ apped &quot; un@@ comfortable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to argue with the confront@@ ation of a very contradic@@ tory Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filtering effects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ proof , but that the yellow light has been pulled into the cutting extreme .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural tunnel wire .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand .
and Snap@@ chat &apos;s big audience young people - who are more diverse in race than their older opponents - could expect to expect sensi@@ bility more likely .
when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters produces an image that is ins@@ ul@@ ting for a user , &quot; it is much more difficult that such things stay un@@ noticed than it was the case before , &quot; the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu said in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete their snap@@ chat account and others on to do the same .
in an ess@@ ay for media and in a telephone interview , she said she believes that rac@@ ed controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the modeling practices at Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the large part white , only male leadership and ended her ess@@ ay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that has largely left the Snap@@ chat un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , it refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ person , the company has recently hired a staff responsible , focusing on under@@ represented population groups and internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu , in turn , said she will close her snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
con@@ scientious obj@@ ector I@@ SIS secret intelligence , establishes committee of the Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence @-@ based information to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the actual conditions allowed on the spot , reported an inquiry committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can Members of the Dis@@ cre@@ tory Committee , secret service committees and the military budget committee , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how hierarch@@ ies changed their assess@@ ments to the American efforts in the struggle against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intelligence @-@ based information , typically sent off by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ Com Commander ships , regularly drawn a positive image of American efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence agencies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted a newspaper article . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives , stated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leadership mistakes in the Cent@@ Com range from the top to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ sided report presents detailed constant problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi armed forces .
although there are no direct indications that government sp@@ ik@@ es have given instructions under Obama to change reports , it shows how analysts exposed the pressure from their faces to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as I@@ SIS or I@@ SIL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before the congress were much more positive than it equ@@ als to the facts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com has publicly announced that a military re @-@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already commen@@ ce in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ sul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress member from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the leaders of Central Command changed the intelligence reports to bring down the danger of I@@ SIS in Iraq .
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force to life after they were playing that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights while the investigation will continue .
in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the Secretary @-@ General of the Ministry of Defense .
on Thursday , democratic Members of the intelligence service published their own findings , which agree with some of the conclusions of the republi@@ can task force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com has created an exc@@ essi@@ vely limited process for the compilation of intelligence @-@ based assess@@ ments on I@@ SIL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; announced the highest @-@ level democr@@ at in the committee , member of the representative house Adam B. Schiff , in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , so Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ aged mor@@ ality among analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave exc@@ essi@@ vely little room for diver@@ gent opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats stated that there was no evidence of a White House &apos;s intervention in the Cent@@ Com Anal@@ ysts in terms of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certain political opinions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s general inspec@@ tor , who were contacted after complaints by Cent@@ Com Anal@@ ysts .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on Congress , while the investigation of the General In@@ spec@@ torate was still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions on interpre@@ ting complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversi@@ al discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions about the question of a successful air campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the ministry of defence ) .
however , the alle@@ g@@ ations of the past year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assess@@ ments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminded me of dis@@ sen@@ sions of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a script about how the then government under George W. Bush fores@@ aw the recommendations of many analysts only a small crew of occupation in Iraq and little time on it to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the u@@ prising against current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker to indicate that contrary to the government &apos;s declar@@ ations of air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State , they had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , because these Pro@@ visional refin@@ eries had put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market .
however , this recognition has not been published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commandments , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was cri@@ tici@@ zed by members of the legisl@@ ature because of his excessive positive app@@ rais@@ al of the war situation at a hearing in front of the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel during the Central Command .
the US won fourth match in the basketball ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Britain is before .
one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she couldn &apos;t remember that ever done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in memory .
this is true , however : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , who remain unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will gain the first and second place each within their group of six teams .
the first place will take a little longer to the strong Dutch woman who will lead the other group .
whatever the game on Saturday , the Americans have spar@@ ked a surprising vort@@ ex through their success story , four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey r@@ ack@@ et in hands ( her two older sisters played sports at Dre@@ xel University ) , at the age of 16 , she became a national player in the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 , because she could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 in which for her and her team everything went wrong .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , trainer of the national team , began to turn things to a better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we did not have the work of work in London that we now have .
we have taken the helm all around .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the door in the first half of the game with a back hand@@ shake from the near area .
India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she completed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved in the middle and placed the ball in the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 leadership .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the gat@@ eke@@ eper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
same as B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on Saturday the outcome of the next game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , as late as it is , the Olympic Games are .
the events in Rio de Jan@@ eiro stand continually and inevitably , a rapid change between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic tor@@ ch itself is a burning rod that is passed from the br@@ acel@@ ets to the swi@@ mmer to the tri@@ ath@@ l@@ ete .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to the talk of your neigh@@ bor in the coffee shop without hearing Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is part of the Olympic Games for the first time and a women &apos;s black with dim@@ ples , could have definitely been among these well @-@ known names being sent to Prime Time by sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising if he would be a swi@@ mmer , gymn@@ ast or even f@@ enc@@ ers .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the ol@@ ymp@@ ic trampoline .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate each event alike .
further from the centre , partially in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognised : air du@@ ster shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast @-@ swim and may it reign for a long time .
but if I have a modest argument for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the discre@@ et charm of the trampoline .
although jumping on tramp@@ ol@@ ines has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years it was so spar@@ sely perceived that many who , I had ques@@ tioned , did not know that it is at all an Olympic sport .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes for competition , there has never been a med@@ al in the trampoline jumping and until 2012 has had an ath@@ l@@ ete who has made it to the final .
the Chinese and the Russi@@ ans tend to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans who share for the women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold med@@ al from London this year .
jumping on the trampoline has a certain out@@ sider charm , partly because it sounds more suitable for the un@@ enlighten@@ ed ear for a c@@ low@@ n school than for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a dedicated enthusi@@ ast .
it has hum@@ orous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous tre@@ mb@@ ling of his never @-@ ending impact @-@ impact - but also the Gra@@ zie of gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , the two sports which it essentially combines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
emerging vic@@ tors jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot nearly up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , h@@ edge and sal@@ ted ) before they land on the feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are assessed according to the official Olympic program according to version , difficulty level and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the most common ol@@ ymp@@ ic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts must continue in their quest for gold further , faster , upward and above , sometimes to the finish , sometimes back and back , up and down on the playground .
they hunt not only the finish line or the base wall , but also in television transmission another pol@@ ite goal : that of the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ords .
the goal @-@ oriented aspir@@ ation is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it &apos;s enough to even stir a spec@@ t@@ ator into tears .
but it &apos;s also what I feel ti@@ ring when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline jum@@ per is above .
a forward motion is not the goal .
he or she pr@@ all@@ t , apparently wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly back up .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no v@@ aults in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympic Games .
the qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming around 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; most of the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final rounds as part of an afternoon block from 14.00 onwards .
in the midst of Olympia @-@ mania they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in the general tum@@ ult .
if the increase in consciousness can be achieved only by the Ang@@ us and the objec@@ ti@@ fication of male athletes - as it recently proposed the male US gymn@@ asts to the The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a generation protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators who demand political changes in Ethiopia are pushing for violent resistance to the government .
witnesses say that dozens of prot@@ esters have been killed during the colli@@ sion with the police .
is Ethiopia right to collapse ?
in the last ten years it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy .
but in the last months protests against the government sho@@ ok the country and expanded into more and more areas .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the response of the government was mer@@ ciful .
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen shot and killed dozens of un@@ armed prot@@ esters .
in circulation , videos about the protests , pres@@ um@@ ably taken from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security people beat young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a stand against a wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights now demands a thorough investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorism across the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital of Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything but an example of democracy - human rights organizations have continually led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , while dis@@ si@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent to exile or in prison , killed or driven into the expan@@ se of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and these have no other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sey@@ ou@@ m Tes@@ home , a lec@@ turer in central @-@ Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold regarding the power of the governing coalition .
after a leng@@ thy critical election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time , tensions continue to rise along the border with Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversi@@ al line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which were more or less defeated in recent years , could use the tur@@ mo@@ il and re @-@ armed .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess tend to explo@@ de after years of in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation under the surface .
the first seems harm@@ less : smartphones .
in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate through social media , as cheaper smartphones have become increasingly common and improved internet services .
even if the government blocked access to Facebook and Twitter what they do at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate about internet pro@@ x@@ ies hiding where they stop .
several young Ethiop@@ ians commented that they were so too protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia largely to Christian high@@ lands , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , many of whom are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas .
but even this is changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are here to coordinate under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the greatest protests took place in the areas of the Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fair dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 percent of the population , dominant in the military , intelligence services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , has until his death at a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed illness in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister .
he was considered a tac@@ tical geni@@ us , a man who could think around corners .
analysts say that he was particularly experienced in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ content and using special officers to manipul@@ ate enemies and to make them harm@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime is lacking in this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively minor reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of security services controlled by the Tig@@ ers .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia had experienced such a uph@@ e@@ av@@ al in 2005 , after thousands of elections prot@@ ested , according to the statements made by analysts , apparently by the government and then stolen .
during the subsequent ra@@ ids many prot@@ esters were killed , even if they were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction .
but evi@@ dently this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ gi@@ vings of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and she assumes a dangerous eth@@ ni@@ cal form .
last month &apos;s prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ an city , run by Tig@@ ray , and the hatred of the Tig@@ ray becomes more and more common in social media .
analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculi@@ ar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for scheduled flights over the neighboring Somalia , even if it recently announced that it closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gr@@ at@@ hike &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains Obama &apos;s claim that I@@ SIS has been founded &quot; Sar@@ kas@@ mus &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump attempted to disp@@ el the last contro@@ vers@@ y on Friday that surro@@ unds his campaign by saying that his repeated claim , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton , would be the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State &apos;s terrorist group , not seriously meant .
this clari@@ fication raised new questions about the communication abilities of the Republi@@ can presidential candidates as to whether he is able to communicate clearly and comprehensi@@ ble with the American public .
it also brings his comrades who endeav@@ our to take care of him during an event@@ ful phase of protection , in the peculi@@ ar position of explaining statements that he could not have meant at all .
after he made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump retired in reference to the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted on interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that President and Mrs. Clinton would have created I@@ SIS .
but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was just sar@@ c@@ astic .
the twe@@ et was the contrast to the previous day , on which Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews he said the accus@@ ation completely serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr Tr@@ ump wanted to we@@ aken the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy I@@ SIS , the Republi@@ can pres@@ idency wanted nothing to know about it .
the last storm of criticism prev@@ ails on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while trying to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling surveys on the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton came spe@@ eches to the economic situation in Michigan in this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return to this subject again .
talking about Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech d@@ ull .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already introduced sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he drew a strong criticism when he thought that the Russi@@ ans were supposed to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton , but he later declared &quot; Of course , &quot; I thought it was sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then re@@ vert back to demand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s one of his ways to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sherman , a communication expert observing the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I think he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
instead of def@@ ying the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has taken an unprecedented note , as his survey values continue to decline .
a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a leading edge in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and head @-@ to @-@ head @-@ race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump fails to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative remarks , he often accused his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his hum@@ or .
but while he rein@@ forces the focus of attention during the last few months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps Scher@@ ze brought his loyal co @-@ workers into the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent inter@@ c@@ essors , gave a great effort to defend the candidate in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Giuli@@ ani said he was ques@@ tioned about the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ umps &apos;s statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama I@@ SIS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them background @-@ t@@ ellers , completely wrong , and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream @-@ rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as foreign minister , allowed I@@ SIS to spread herself by under@@ taking control of the situation in the Middle East .
in front of the election campaigns in Pennsylvania , Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being ro@@ uted on each of his words and to be prejudi@@ ced against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , sham@@ eful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats spot@@ ted about Mr. Tr@@ umps ap@@ ology than just another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
once driven over the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point comes back
Ver@@ b Cafe was a big café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but served for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front were displac@@ ed .
the shop So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , replacing the verb in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
indigenous people seized it as the last loss in a city &apos;s gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ usa wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is exemp@@ ted and leaving now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York is changing , then it is also new finding .
a revi@@ ved verb Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old coffee shop , the owner and manager of the new coffee shop .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a client offered him to provide funds for a new out@@ lay , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so cabin model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wi@@ ches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ nish like cap@@ ers and s@@ aut@@ é@@ ed onions .
there are natural mu@@ gs .
the café does not serve beer , but there are fresh ju@@ ices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also ou@@ sted by Willi@@ am@@ sburg prices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oliv@@ eira was such a client .
Oliv@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg earlier and visited the verb regularly .
even after moving to Green@@ point , she would take the road .
after the verb closed , she gave up the coffee t@@ ines for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized that there was coffee and culture in the verb that I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea instead of her usual coffee coffee , which is another new addition .
since the beginning of the verb , Tom Ros@@ enthal is another long@@ time and faithful customer .
he went there before the work , and he always kept the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Bag@@ el with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Bag@@ el with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he didn &apos;t have a gru@@ dge that the soap business has taken the old business room .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie offered to produce a special soap for spo@@ il@@ age with the cold @-@ fried coffee of the coffee bar as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go down to their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish residents Green@@ points also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he preferred to exhibit her soon so that his new neigh@@ bors feel welcome .
the site also has further advantages .
a local juice local wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ fried coffee into bottles .
there is a chance that the café is expanded to a neighboring building .
for many customers a new verb goes out to get their old favorites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed by the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the setting of the restaurant and the order felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to smell &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a rich meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his as@@ cen@@ sion to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt made a Fai@@ ble for refined delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on that day was somewhat modest : stu@@ ff@@ ed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ ans .
CO@@ Es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Zi@@ egel@@ man told in her book &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; about living in a residential house at the Lower East Side from the food perspective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; An decent meal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in Har@@ per Publishing , illustr@@ ates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a rep@@ orter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sand@@ wich shop , a small , sle@@ ek snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in the store since the stock market crash 1929 .
Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sand@@ wich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture .
when the rep@@ orter ordered h@@ ackers , the pair found the pair for discussion about eating in the era of the Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , Leb@@ erk@@ ä@@ se and sav@@ ory bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper , which stretches the ingredient .
imagine to eat so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as supp@@ er .
Co@@ E gr@@ inn@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years prior to the Great Depression the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cooked for male field@@ work and it was served fresh baked p@@ â@@ té for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the Americans , who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; shows the ways that the land was moving to no longer be the land of land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when eating for Americans became a central , ten@@ se theme , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e praised why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new bud@@ get@@ ary was equally ten@@ se : mysterious food such as bread and c@@ asser@@ ole were stap@@ le foods , which c@@ asser@@ ole again as &quot; wonderful art , food resi@@ due , &quot; noted Zi@@ egel@@ man , as coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit .
meat , which was the focal point of American cuisine for years , became a rarely served luxury .
peculi@@ ar bl@@ ends have been tried , as a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction jump@@ ed preced@@ ence over taste or even healthy food .
during their research for the book which also includes recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish of this epoch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter , too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not any addi@@ tive at noon , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
as never before , or ever since , bud@@ get@@ ary econom@@ ists - including Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country like that .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; bud@@ get@@ ary politicians &quot; and the challenge of transforming p@@ amp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ r@@ ots into delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a feast of historical treats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the reports on the government &apos;s response to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ C@@ ake @-@ Essen @-@ attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa peasant house kitchen of his kitchen , he fed up as the milli@@ on@@ se man of the world to which he became .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wor@@ e a tu@@ g .
he was wonderfully realistic .
President Roos@@ ev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or asked him to take an exit with his stomach .
as described in the book , the employment of a hou@@ se@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roos@@ ev@@ elt explains that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ted ones . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression to deal with food was rejected as soon as the country reg@@ ained its legs again .
the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as on how science has been applied to food .
in writing the book , the couple had better understood the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law - for example how they could not throw food away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of w@@ asting food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she actually made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the case of the wind blow .
after the plates were evacu@@ ated at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and co@@ e produced a dessert that they had prepared at home : plant@@ ing the plant@@ ation , the president Roos@@ ev@@ elt in mid@@ day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a bad trick to give modest recipes a chic name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , just pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone di@@ pped a little rel@@ uc@@ t@@ antly a spo@@ on in the teeth , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it tast@@ ed not bad .
Co@@ E repeated three times a night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer , he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bom@@ bs : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in a bom@@ bing attack by the Assad regime .
O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil defence group , which according to Bild @-@ Zeitung saved nearly 6@@ 0,000 people alive .
29@@ 00 Vol@@ unte@@ ers put their own lives on the game to pull people out of bom@@ bed houses and to make first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the Civil Gu@@ ards showing him at a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a m@@ amm@@ ing out of the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbolic figure in the hor@@ ror of war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , as heroes , he has never seen himself , said to the image : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the genuine Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I die , to save lives , I think God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot;
just before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ bing ra@@ ids in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have dischar@@ ged four façade bom@@ bs over the Alz@@ adia district , one was filled with chlor@@ ine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven men suffer from difficulty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now er@@ adi@@ cate the poison@@ ous remn@@ ants of the bomb so that not children play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; c@@ ites the image of his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of Assad &apos;s regime had to hit terrorists .
Grön@@ land - the oldest cycl@@ one is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks usually only come to the surface in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks get offspring with 150 years of offspring .
lei@@ surely , the Grön@@ land shar@@ ks at the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean , in an hour it comes at an average straight 1,@@ 220 meters .
only when it comes to it , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates to sat@@ te 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
this li@@ fel@@ ong lifestyle , however , seems to be a recipe for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate from a Grön@@ land shar@@ k who could be 392 years old .
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein comments from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span , which means a world record for ver@@ teb@@ rates .
although the evolution@@ ary bi@@ ologist had already suspected that Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks become stone @-@ old .
only lack@@ ed the evidence .
Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks are hard to observe , after all , they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated co@@ asts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in winter at the surface .
researchers know little about the habit@@ ats of the Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks .
their slow @-@ pent@@ ag@@ us measured it when they equi@@ ped six animals with a transmitter in front of Sp@@ it@@ s@@ bergen .
nevertheless , these shar@@ ks do this shar@@ ks : in the stomach of a animal researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear .
possibly they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice @-@ sea and seek cad@@ aver , that from higher water layers down tor@@ ques .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks that fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 in Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as a by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long while the biggest 502 cm size was measured .
to determine the age of animals , they analyzed the len@@ tic@@ ular nucle@@ us of the shar@@ ks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens is already born before the birth of the shar@@ ks , the protein contained in it will no longer be renewed .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had notably a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the len@@ tic@@ ular nucle@@ us .
their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , as a nuclear weapon search for greater quantities of this radio@@ active carbon into the atmosphere .
in the third smallest animal of 220 centimet@@ ers , the len@@ tic@@ ular , on the other hand , enth@@ ron@@ es a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the atomic weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
all larger Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts , which origin@@ ate from cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 493 @-@ cen@@ timeter long Grön@@ land shar@@ k showed an age of 335 years , while the record @-@ shar@@ k is likely to be 392 years old with 502 centimet@@ ers .
the fact that Grön@@ land @-@ females got up later , when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers of the length could assign an age .
since one of the animals with 392 centimet@@ ers probably stood at the threshold of the sex@@ ually mature and its age was determined at 156 years , Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks with the multip@@ lication became apparent at least one and a half centuries .
also this is likely to be world record for ver@@ teb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ em@@ es live mainly in icy waters is not a coinci@@ dence .
the previous record holder , a 211 @-@ year old Greenland wh@@ ale , in whose bac@@ on at the neck had a 120 @-@ year old har@@ poon point , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the living animals often runs on as@@ parag@@ us .
so they mature later - and age s@@ lower .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often very big .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of eleph@@ ant .
another advantage : they have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the evolution@@ ary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , a very large animal should invest its resources in a long life .
building plot in double pack
the Municipal Council dealt with topics related to construction in the latest session .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the Board accepted the communication of mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , the marketing of the recently proven living areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after clearing the land , par@@ cel@@ ing and closing questions and the requests for survey , the sale of land plots in the residential areas &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area of Bin@@ der@@ straße - section 1 ) is nothing more in the way .
the municipal council is convinced that the bro@@ oks in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au attract young families and rü@@ st sen@@ iors alike .
as promised , volunteers can register now in the town hall , and the par@@ cel is expected to give advice to the Municipal Council in its September session .
in order to meet also requests for res@@ ett@@ lement of other commercial enterprises , associated with the creation of work@@ places , the Municipal Council decided to change the area of land re@@ designed only in the spring of this year .
in the Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n area , the industrial area already designated there is wi@@ dened by two plots in the direction of State Road 21@@ 12 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
the city on the Main , therefore , has the best chances of attrac@@ ting jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is most likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the Institute of Excellence for Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is un@@ certain whether financial transactions continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , they have now been granted approval in the UK . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are just large US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lob@@ b@@ ying association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expects 10000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( EC@@ B ) , un@@ ites the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro@@ zone , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervision EI@@ OP@@ A and the risk council ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the EC@@ B .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the bank@@ note is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Luxembourg does not hide a large fund , but also like Dublin for the infrastructure deteri@@ or@@ ates .
Frankfurt is significantly easier to reach thanks to the big airport .
further points are the city with easily available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not as easy to find free high quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Seine , the rent for first @-@ class commercial real estate is 50 percent higher than on the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition , thanks to good medical care and infrastructure , as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the management consultancy Mer@@ cer the city ranks seventh , Luxembourg at No. 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris at 37 . place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although quality of life is a matter of preference : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial centre for the internal market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but London will remain the most important financial center in Europe despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , my business researchers .
for this , the forces of forces : in London , according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015 , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2,500 .
Gilead receives legal cost from h@@ epatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a US judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the legal expenses arising from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ st C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was exemp@@ t from damage compensation amoun@@ ting to $ 200 million for the injury of two patents of Mer@@ ck , who stood in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster medications so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i von Gilead after a US judge un@@ covered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including the Mein@@ l and other non @-@ ethical acts .
when the complaint was collected on Thursday , U.S. counter@@ part Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is claiming the costs incurred during the defense of the case .
Mer@@ ck is trying to equi@@ p with Gilead that domin@@ ates the market of a new generation of h@@ epatitis C medicines that can heal more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to the year 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck mig@@ rated each other and claimed property on laboratory work aimed at adding Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under perfect control , but we are just carrying out clean @-@ up work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 34.@@ 2 % federal taxes
on Friday , Hill@@ ary Clinton released their tax return for 2015 , this resulted in the US presidential candidate of Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.@@ 2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated $ 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former president Bill Clinton generated USD 5.3 million in the hon@@ orary papers ; the former foreign minister gave an income of USD 3 million from the publisher Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book on her term in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for the Vice @-@ Pres@@ idency , Sen@@ ator Tim KA@@ INE from Virginia , published his tax declar@@ ations of the last ten years together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim KA@@ INE continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced Clin@@ tons campaign hel@@ per Jenni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a stark contrast to that , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false exc@@ uses and re@@ trac@@ ers in terms of his previous promises to publish his declar@@ ations .
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declar@@ ations although they are not oblig@@ ated by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers argu@@ ed as the reason for his ref@@ usal to control tax inspec@@ tions by tax authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clin@@ tons Ele@@ ction assistant Ian S@@ ams on Twitter with regards to the publication of the presidential candidate of Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ umps Special Consult@@ ants , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before tax inspec@@ tions are not complete .
pumps critics , including the Republi@@ can pres@@ idency of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his ref@@ usal to raise questions regarding assets , its donations for char@@ itable organisations , its business forms and various other links , particularly with Russia .
Clinton has already pl@@ ung@@ ed on the subject and published a video on the internet on Friday in the high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump to publish his tax return .
on Thursday , she spoke to the topic also during a speech on the economy in Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do what every other candidate has done during the last decades and publish his declar@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
PO@@ LI@@ TI@@ CO reported that during the 1990s Tr@@ ump has paid no or very little tax during the 1990s , and an economic journalist from the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants on Friday , declar@@ ations that this could still be the case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , who would make sure people pay more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for Hill@@ ary Clinton in the past week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka demanded buff@@ ets , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its seat here , Tr@@ ump to exchange their tax declar@@ ations .
Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a contro@@ vers@@ y by IR@@ S and Tr@@ ump was afraid of vot@@ ers and not front tax authorities .
Clinton &apos;s campaign has left tax return back to 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons , who are now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an average rate of approximately 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of around 4@@ 0.5 % .
the tax return of the Clin@@ tons of 2015 showed that these only USD 100 of their income were referred to as wage , unlike most of the Americans .
their main investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which the Clin@@ tons divi@@ den@@ ds and yields from USD 10@@ 9,@@ 000 were controlled .

con@@ doms with chili powder , fire@@ works promote Tanz@@ ani@@ as eleph@@ ant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ers in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going into inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with chili powder .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , who had the idea for years ago , has intensi@@ fied its funding together with the U.S. natural protection by trained volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non@@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their houses and crops without viol@@ ating animals .
before , many spe@@ ar have used to defend themselves .
Friday is the world &apos;s day dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we could observe a change in their attitude within these communities , with much more confident that they can hold the eleph@@ ants from their fields without dam@@ aging the eleph@@ ants , &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message .
the first two steps embrace the light of the eleph@@ ant with a tor@@ ch and the blowing in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chili wolf &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth is packed into a con@@ dom together with a fire@@ works , whose end is turned to the ignition cord .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust on chili powder in the air .
a touch quite usually starts to hunt the eleph@@ ant .
one last option represents a thro@@ wer that sho@@ ots a gold @-@ fired fire@@ works into the air and creates a loud , light explosion .

the proposal for the new building of a sales office on the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhein@@ bal@@ k@@ ons on the Rhine , however , rejected the city Council .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle , we welcome new tra@@ ders , but at this location in an exposed position on the Rhine shore , this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director breaks Berlin hotel because Israeli pre@@ fix was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media rebel@@ lion after he betra@@ yed that Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin has not listed Israeli pre@@ fix since it would have requested Arab guests according to a staff . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of Holocaust documentary Sho@@ ah , made his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country &apos;s list of countries .
however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in the year 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel is eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center .
looking for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel staff stated that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of Kemp@@ inski Hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it was more anger in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of our guests are Arab@@ s and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employee was quoted from Lanz@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli ambassador to Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; big shame , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied and up@@ set by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a fairly large response in the internet , in which people called the whole a sc@@ andal .
some subordin@@ ated to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have given the alleged sum@@ mons of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in another post , in which it was pointed out that the hotel located on the cl@@ assy Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm is near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly dismis@@ sed all alle@@ g@@ ations of itself and called the incident an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ ze &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct instruction , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to not include Israel in the quick@@ est list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokes@@ man for Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code has been added now .
police sets up tear gas &amp; rubber floor against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students were sitting on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police put a tear gas and a rubber cock against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties started when police officers tried to disp@@ ense with the students , which led to the police of Gum@@ mis@@ esch@@ ule and Tr@@ än@@ ger@@ as .
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
according to the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , less than 100 public schools are closed while 300@@ ,000 students are implemented to save money .
some of the prot@@ esters saw Gra@@ ff@@ i@@ jn spra@@ yed against the pro@@ visional president of Michel Tim@@ er on walls .
the latest protests occurred several days after prot@@ esters went to the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff who had been enth@@ r@@ alled by a vote of the Senate for their dismis@@ sal from office .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly increased to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and T@@ eher@@ an grew by 7@@ 0.9 percent in the year .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been aboli@@ shed , the interest in Russian companies grew strongly in business in the country , the ambassador said .
Russian companies have established existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to get access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the further commercial exploitation is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noticed that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 7@@ 0.9 percent in the first five months of the year 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports in Iran increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade recovery was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year , D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , the Russian foreign representation issued some 35,@@ 000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel visa , Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries concerned with the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia of the last year are broken , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only relatively few Russi@@ ans visit Iran , something from which the ambassador hoping it will change .
&quot; personally , I can recommend visiting cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have preserved the monuments of ancient Persi@@ an civilization in a good state , &quot; he said .

Nag@@ old : play and fun during the summer
eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social ped@@ agog@@ ical day group / social group work of the child protection association Nag@@ old with their assist@@ ants during their summer holidays in Nuss@@ dorf near Mühl@@ acker .
in the quietly located Freizei@@ theim Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle , the life @-@ joy@@ ful group was set up during the first school holiday week .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand we went to Bret@@ ten with the visit of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sp@@ el@@ z@@ oos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other to Jews , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous con@@ vent .
the third trip led to P@@ for@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days the group took pleasure in the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited to jump , swim and sp@@ lash .
in culinary terms , children and car@@ ers with their self @-@ prepared body@@ work , such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese were spoiled .
in workshops it was possible to create beautiful pieces of jewelry made of pearls and stones or made of wood a Roman @-@ mill game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; further highlights of the leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Color@@ ful evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the day of the return journey the sun and the children and you@@ ths returned home satisfied .
ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the Gateway of Mer@@ cy
the ministers from the past@@ oral care unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
together , four stages were dealt with .
in order to bridge the period up to the next roman@@ ce journey of every minister in a pres@@ um@@ ably two years , the top @-@ level round St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
various pilgri@@ m@@ ages were checked and one decided finally for the bishop &apos;s city of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , with the open gate of mercy on Freiburg &apos;s Münster a special pilgrimage destination was offered .
16 Min@@ is from B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gre@@ ene , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and S@@ hal@@ om , set themselves in the way .
in the evening before , past@@ or stor@@ ost sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgri@@ m crosses and par@@ ted the pilgrimage .
from Hor@@ b it was driven by train to the starting point Vill@@ ingen , where also a Münster un@@ ser@@ er Lady is standing and so the pilgrimage from Münster was started .
the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening , depending on a short impulse with various prayers , songs and ty@@ pe@@ faces .
but also on the way , the Min@@ is made a stop at field cross@@ ings , chap@@ els or churches to sing together a song from a specially assembled Pil@@ gri@@ m song .
the local par@@ ishes were available for the overnight stays .
Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Heidi F@@ aller attended the stage destinations for a tasty and powerful dinner and breakfast .
on the second day we continued on Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
after that , one stepped into the stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch , but at first some 500 metres of altitude had to be climb@@ ed and then climb@@ ed again .
the deser@@ ved reward was a joint barbecue at the lake of Bad@@ wei@@ her in the evening .
after the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrimage church in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter it went to the final stage to Freiburg .
a visi@@ bly facilit@@ ated and happy the Min@@ is arrived at the Freiburg cathedral in the late afternoon and went through the gate of mercy .
with a little stimul@@ us , God was given thanks .
at the E@@ ven@@ ing Mass in Münster , the Min@@ is of co@@ operator Markus O@@ bert were welcomed at the Pil@@ gri@@ mage &apos;s destination .
after the divine service the pilgrims were able to view the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the Brei@@ s@@ gau@@ ole .
in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b .
at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spiritu@@ ality and a strong community experience were marked .
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ ms home when Br@@ ite won gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner last night in the men team @-@ Sprint in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame when the British team def@@ ended the London 2012 title .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glas@@ gow took the anchor , which his fellow Sir Chris Ho@@ y had turned to E@@ igen . the J@@ ungsp@@ und made the legend proud when he went home to visit a victory from New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic medals .
they repeated the trick after seeing only a modest sixth place in London in March at the London Underground World Championships in London .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a hin@@ d@@ rance .
Ho@@ dy &apos;s retirement generated a gap that Ki@@ an Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y Win@@ ner - and Sk@@ inner played an Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord in the qualification laps , but in the standard races the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ der came back after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner kept it .
a strategy change made a great part of the transformation , when passing in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as a BBC expert and liked Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they stepped on the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glas@@ gow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make me a name .
we placed an ol@@ ymp@@ ic record in the final round and defeated the world champion .
it was just unbeliev@@ able .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph of 2012 on the side Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ der claimed that after a weak start he inten@@ tionally fell on the track .
he returned this statement later and there was no obj@@ ection to England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels with the whole UK flags on the grand@@ stand like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team over the past three months .
we have gone so badly with so many world titles that it was unbeliev@@ able to win again at the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event , a gold med@@ al for the nation winning seven out of ten titles both in Beijing and London .
if this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days in the cycle of Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of the possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who also was born on March 23 ( a seemingly holy date for British sport ; on that day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver med@@ al .
this is equal to that of Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint , which starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels somewhat lon@@ ely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only med@@ al competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in four @-@ four kilometer racing .
they arrived at the destination in 3 : 5@@ 1,9@@ 42 .
the World Record that won Gold in 2012 was 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place today on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
he had fought yesterday with representatives prior to the qualification , when function@@ aries called him to measure his height .
in the appropriate Women &apos;s Competition , which continues and ends tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team relies on its strong track team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to pick a par of medals .
after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , expectations for Rio were shut down .
in the background , drama was played in the background , so the res@@ ign@@ ation of Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s technical leader in April , in the midst of S@@ elling and M@@ ob@@ b@@ ings , as well as retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on .
but if you see the first evening of the competition in Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite like that , as the legendary reputation of G@@ TT , who has reached its peak at the perfect moment , could be repeated again .
future of the melting of Port@@ land due to the aboli@@ tion of energy consumption frag@@ ile
the future of the aluminium melting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers - are at stake , as the plant operator termin@@ ate the energy supply contract and thus lift all supply contracts as the energy company delivering supplies .
this step followed the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years runs in November .
up to 2,000 jobs in the Al@@ coa plant in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2000 work@@ stations - direct and indirect - could be endangered at a closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects , as the melt is consumed about 10 percent of the total power generation of Vict@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 Al@@ coa completed the Point Henry Mel@@ ting , which led to a close @-@ up of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station last year .
the sm@@ el@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the price of electricity for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium mel@@ t@@ ey with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , shared that three more owners will announce their contracts .
the plant is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , including the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p holding smaller shares .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means another physical demand for electricity through the melting plant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that should have come into force in November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month termination period , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from this point , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the fiscal year 17 will contribute to revenues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on the income to AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by forec@@ asting the strong terminal markets for wholesale prices .
AG@@ L shared that it has already written the value of the contracts in its annual subscription to the amount of $ 187 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of a dismis@@ sal . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said the decision to extra@@ dite the contracts , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not imp@@ air . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said that it had concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang in 2010 , which would have come into effect from November this year , even if it is still an explanation why it res@@ igned from the contract .
analysts war@@ n due to the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Port@@ land Schmel@@ zer in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
in reference to the statements by analysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land will consume around 600 meg@@ aw@@ at@@ ts each year and Tom@@ ago consume about 900 meg@@ aw@@ at@@ ts of electricity every year .
should both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generator , that would not be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , San Antonio is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue
Antonio J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an J@@ enner , C@@ lan@@ s Kr@@ is , is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September edition of the US Vo@@ gue .
Kendall , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ ag@@ ram account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the spectac@@ le of this cover brought me to tears , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Kendall . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cover of the Co@@ vers followed a bizar@@ re ( or just keeping up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an &apos;s like ? ) , scre@@ ened reality video , which shows the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an J@@ enner family ( except for the problem cases Rob and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) as well as in the presence of the most popular Show@@ biz @-@ un@@ cle and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as they forget the cover of their sister and that ends with a classic turn : they all have a surprise party planned .
this represents the stere@@ otyp@@ ed action of nearly every birthday pas@@ cal of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; you thought we had forgotten you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a carto@@ on on a sen@@ de@@ platz at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to take part in this public@@ ity somehow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with regard to the September edition of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of the career of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has begun .
Kend@@ al &apos;s big sister Kim likes her , as for the Vo@@ gue @-@ Cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a le@@ ague for itself .
the September edition is the most sold @-@ out edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference that resem@@ bles more a picture band as a fashion magazine , the issue draws a large number of adverti@@ sers ( According to Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ist@@ a were of the 8@@ 32 pages of the Wäl@@ zer 615 pages advertising ) .
the revelation of his cover star is expected to be so long@@ ingly expected that in the last two years pictures of the magazine are still se@@ eping before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ist@@ a and Kate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties who mo@@ w &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models , celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar Prize winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jenni@@ fer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
but even at the low chance that Mrs. J@@ enner - which is described by the magazine as the &quot; break @-@ out model &quot; of its generation - falls under the former category , it is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or adol@@ escents from today who know how to turn a good snap@@ chat video ( even if everything is true to J@@ enner ) .
they are truly talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had been one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s success doesn &apos;t like success .
with her reality TV story J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world has always been ten@@ se .
in June , Victoria &apos;s Secret model Steph@@ anie Sey@@ m@@ our J@@ enner and her colleague Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d critic@@ ised and called her &quot; the mi@@ st@@ rop@@ es of the moment . &quot;
these feelings came up again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mis@@ sm@@ ut &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; side seems to go by at the point . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Antonio J@@ enner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
she and all her sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her handmade pictures of Cin@@ dy C@@ RA@@ W@@ FOR@@ DS daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is to be seen in reality TV . pres@@ um@@ ably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
municipal Centers provide 16@@ 0,000 people annually
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s aux@@ ili@@ aries are reported annually by the municipal law centres , while the industry is taking on the effects of further aver@@ ages on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land there are already three of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , ne@@ edy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means of un@@ just del@@ og@@ ations and the like - at their request for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already out@@ law@@ fully utilized , are ready for further cuts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from June next year , it is fores@@ een that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the director of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Union of Community Centers has revealed that thousands of people have already been rejected each year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Far@@ rell said that the situation would only be worse without cancellation of the decision of the Federal Government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centers are chron@@ ically funded , which means that thousands of people from important services you need to be rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and op@@ pres@@ sive deb@@ ts , families who have been dismis@@ sed by separ@@ ations - all these people have problems of right kind and this survey shows that they can &apos;t get the help they need .
the Federal Government will cut the funds by 30 percent from June 2017 , meaning that thousands of people in need of Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we urge the General Prosec@@ utor and the Federal Foreign Affairs Minister as well as the Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to delay these aver@@ ages immediately so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year the provincial government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their communities , and that the Government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k is investing in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign accused of having allegedly used weapons
new York : Donald Tr@@ umps &apos;s campaign has been accused of alleged in@@ action after being told that its campaign manager for North Carolina placed a fire@@ arm on a staff while traveling in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in a indictment which was filed on Wednesday at Charlotte &apos;s Constitutional Court by Vincent Bord@@ ini , a former software program@@ mer for the campaign in this federal state .
Bord@@ ini had been waiting for months to have been waiting for the matter to be controlled internally before he realis@@ es that &quot; that would not happen . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the director of the campaign , Earl Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulled a gun , placed his right foref@@ inger on the trigger , and r@@ amm@@ ed the run into Vinc@@ ent Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave Bord@@ ini in his charge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
having compl@@ ained about the local and regional campaign management , Bord@@ ini noted that at least four other persons had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he admitted in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to cause harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave Bord@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only two days after the Republi@@ can pres@@ idency candidate dissolved a tur@@ mo@@ il when he said a crowd of people in North Carolina said that &quot; Second Am@@ end@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arms owners and arms lovers - should take action in case his ri@@ val@@ ry should be elected by Hill@@ ary Clinton and judge judges .
the campaign clearly stated that the media would have ri@@ pped his words out of context and that he would not inc@@ ite violence .
B@@ ordin@@ is complaint demands damages from the campaign for the violation of due di@@ ligen@@ ce and by Philip for bodily injury and sustained psychological damage .
m@@ umps Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher@@ in Hope H@@ icks was not to be reached for a statement .

Berlin / Schwerin : survey before country elections : losing SPD and CD@@ U
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , considerable losses are drawn for the ruling party SPD and CD@@ U .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black government coalition in the North could hardly reign , this is not possible in Berlin after the survey values .
in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to head the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern the SPD collap@@ sed from 35.@@ 6 percent a year ago to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party was only slightly ahead of the CD@@ U , which could rise again to 23 percent .
the third place is cont@@ ested between the Left and the Af@@ D .
the left would be 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the parliament .
despite modest losses , the Gre@@ ens were rel@@ uc@@ t@@ ant to return to the Schwer@@ iner Land@@ tag despite slight losses ( previously 8.4 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented by 3 percent in parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the survey , the SPD of the survey estimated only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the de@@ pu@@ te department . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with 5 per cent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pir@@ ates would not miss the entry in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow @-@ motion : 20 years ago , the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market .
the success@@ ors today domin@@ ate the world - his maker experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was th@@ icker and bigger , therefore it was not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was quite kno@@ cking .
the built @-@ in memory was initially eight meg@@ aby@@ tes , which would suff@@ ice for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gig@@ aby@@ tes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came into shops exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few Euro fans can buy the equipment on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age .
20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months ago at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Büro in West@@ ent@@ asch@@ en@@ format &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
indeed , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for then standards : SMS and e @-@ mails were sent and received , even via fax was the communic@@ ator .
even access to web pages was possible via HTML browser , although agon@@ izing slowly .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
the prize was pretty proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , about 1400 Euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was from 392 Euro in 2015 .
no one could imagine in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
the mobile phone division of Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , and was eventually sold and handled by Microsoft .
today , the market domin@@ ates providers that all came much later than Nokia .
always and everywhere online , that is today for a lot of people &apos;s everyday lives .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users around the world .
some 1.4 billion devices , Samsung and Apple , were sold alone 555 million units .
worldwide sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
for this purpose , the well @-@ running shops of the countless app providers and the telecommunications group come together .
in the meantime , a whole industry has emerged around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough on the mass market was first launched at the beginning of 2007 , then Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones on the Mac @-@ World .
he promised three instruments in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communications , everything by touch screen is easy to use .
Apple started winning Apple , even today , the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry that dominated the market had the look@@ out .
she finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the legends now have Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention .
on average every German is now looking for 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must all learn to take the smartphone out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in charge of the Siemens board of staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must ste@@ er the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will not only bring renewal and prosperity all over the country in our local communities and throughout London .
for me , it was the biggest attraction He@@ ath@@ row , just as in 2012 in London , when we run a great effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions benef@@ ited from the games .
the Olympics brought great advantages for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for locals and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities , we alone will create 10,000 new apprentic@@ es@@ hips , create 4@@ 0,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment .
just as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding He@@ ath@@ row is too big .
I have been told that England will never be ready for the Games and that we will be bl@@ am@@ ant on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had w@@ ron@@ ged in 2012 and they are also wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question asked .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enlargement is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in swe@@ eping growth and leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and in the whole UK . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , to T2 , which was built in the middle of the two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time for us to ste@@ er this ol@@ ymp@@ ic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future commerce and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz and Mouse game &quot; regarding ad blocking
&quot; &quot; &quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers , attempts to b@@ ypass ad blocking , like a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block displays on its desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post where it shared that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising on the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared that its desktop page would change the encoding regarding its adverti@@ sements to make it display lock@@ ings the recognition of which part of the page advertising is to be difficult to recognize .
but Ad@@ block announced it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blog@@ post , the spokes@@ person of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her @-@ fight between the time @-@ giving open source community and the conver@@ ters has been underway since the invention of display lock@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest company for social media has settled in the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicators for the industry have become .
according to a study from the last year of Pag@@ ef@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people are using display lock@@ ers worldwide , almost four times so much 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion active users , who access Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of the adverti@@ sers .
apart from that mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on the mobile network and inst@@ ag@@ ram &apos;s mobile ad block@@ ers , a spokes@@ man shared .
advertisement on desktop PCs makes a large amount of recei@@ pts to Facebook so that Facebook appears to invest in such a stri@@ de as worthwhile .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would update its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad prevention tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give people more control over their commerci@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ dress would be wor@@ rying new filters because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Facebook speaker in an email message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a stup@@ id means , which is why we have instead focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of the people .
woman in suspected su@@ icide on Swiss highway
the victim lay in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday passed a suspected su@@ icide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman lay down in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of des@@ per@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 , who was transferred by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she died on site .
several drivers were already heard , but some have still not been identified , the police told them to report to them as well as any witnesses of the incident .
a investigation proceedings were opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter divided the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a colli@@ sion avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor needs to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers are not being held ac@@ coun@@ table .
in each of the two cases where a person ran in the dark on the highway , it was decided that drivers do not need to assume that a pedestrian run in the middle of the night on the highway as it was in the newspaper .
last year , a police officer was acqu@@ itted of the negli@@ gent killing after having crossed and killed a man who lay in August 2014 one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had dr@@ unk and has become un@@ conscious on the road , took the court .
the court found that the polic@@ eman -- who had responded to a call -- went on a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely exceptional and unfor@@ es@@ een situation &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges , should contact the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NA@@ SA climate model : Venus was once inhabit@@ able
the Venus was probably inhabit@@ able according to the proj@@ ections of a new NA@@ SA climate model .
scientists at Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of the NA@@ SA developed a model to discover the past of Venus by means of tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether Venus could have revealed similar conditions with their hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that the Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and still rotating slowly .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from ev@@ ap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun which was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow revolution of Venus ex@@ poses its day @-@ side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; said G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts as a umbrella to shield the surface from most of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures that are some degree cooler than the ones of the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus that resem@@ bles the evolution that had previously been suspected by planetary researchers .
although it was probably habit@@ able , Venus -- over the course of several billions years --@@ was exposed to heat and ultra@@ violet light .
their oceans ev@@ apor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was fired from ultra@@ violet light .
when their hydro@@ gen escaped , there remained only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect - Venus , the way we know it today .
the researchers divided the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy coming back as a trainer of Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to a slight co @-@ determination right in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternative President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will be immediately looking for a new coach .
&quot; in the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy speaking in a statement .
in the course of the summer , I have been thinking about how I could improve this team in order to give him more depth , it needed and to bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the Vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organisation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic , who had queu@@ ed up on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; Patrick was informed about this decision today , &quot; said Sak@@ ic .
we appreciate all that he has done for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Roy has been honored as the Best Trainer of the League during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
he put the club on 112 points and in the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was hit in the first round of the Pl@@ a@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the post@@ season in each of the last two years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the wild for a second Wild@@ card Spot in the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two tunes with the Montreal Canadi@@ ans and Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ öl@@ dner takes up discussions again , put strike off
the work struggles on re@@ mun@@ eration for North Sea oil workers are exposed , while all disputes for a new round of discussions are set to the table , negoti@@ ators said .
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group have been carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group and the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT unions can confirm that we agreed to restart the process of process of the present strike , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will keep some full @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks , which will start next year to restart the problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in more than 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , the Wood Group has short@@ ened the rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s recommendation follows a 10 % reduction in on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts give the company the required space to get through the market down@@ turn .
shell has dismis@@ sed thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas trading activities in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its monetary union with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure because of the lower cru@@ de oil prices , an economic situation that was reinforced by the British decision in June to leave the European Union .
the Scot@@ tish parliament member , Dave Anderson , met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest work disputes ever held in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion is expected for new projects in the North Sea in comparison to about $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures rotation rate of stars in the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates under the stars of the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data can help astronom@@ ers understand why stars in star clu@@ sters rot@@ ate at different rates as well as in what context the rotation periods stand with the planetary formation .
&quot; we hope that through comparing our results with other stars , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 445 light @-@ years distant from the earth .
many stars in this cluster , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ th@@ ood .
they are now turning the fastest .
at peak rotation rates , these str@@ apping stars push large amounts of star@@ vation .
as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star fails , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recogni@@ zing the time between the appearance of a recogni@@ zable star @-@ spot -- like sun@@ spots -- recogni@@ zes .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates suggests that more massive stars revol@@ ve more slowly than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , while larger stars revol@@ ve more slowly than smaller ones .
&quot; in the B@@ allet of the P@@ lei@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
since the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and , so to speak , hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in three newspaper reports extensively on their latest analysis of the presentation rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversi@@ al bas@@ eb@@ all @-@ star occurs
the tears ran at Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the US Bas@@ eb@@ all star in the best days of Base to Base .
after his emotional re@@ course announcement , the 41 year old pro will wear the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on August 12 against the T@@ ampa Bay R@@ ays .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say goo@@ dbye to goo@@ dbye , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star Game participant at Major League Bas@@ eb@@ all ( ML@@ B ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three times , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was chosen to be the most valuable player in the League , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract signed him 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will in future serve as a coun@@ sel@@ or and youth coach - with full sal@@ ary .
as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez returns time with performance for a long time .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marine ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed to create some mil@@ estones .
with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie M@@ ays , only two other bas@@ eb@@ all players have similar values in the most important statistics .
but in the hall of the bas@@ eb@@ all the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is not likely to be accepted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was on the field , so cont@@ ested is its occurrence outside the square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2009 , the super@@ star was admitted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between 2001 and 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was closed for 211 games due to a settlement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal by the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is regarded as the main susp@@ ect , for years about an anti @-@ aging clinic in Southern Florida to have received high @-@ performance funds .
after a dispute , the lock was reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done a favor for the year 2014 because I played for 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez at that time sweet@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even his far@@ ewell days are not no@@ is@@ eless .
while many bas@@ eb@@ all legends receive the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez had to sit on the bench frequently .
&quot; my job does not include a far@@ ewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win each game , &quot; says Yan@@ ke@@ es coach Joe Gir@@ ardi .
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and told the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress Kate Hudson , sympathy and sympathy of the fans of Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Erz@@ riv@@ alen Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ Rod , &quot; the followers of the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez @-@ Team .
Olympia 2016 : chen Xin@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first dop@@ ing cases
caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio should not start .
Rio de Jan@@ eiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
a liter@@ al ath@@ l@@ ete would have won almost a med@@ al .
the first official dop@@ ing events in Rio de Jan@@ eiro have become known before the seventh competition day .
the Chinese swi@@ mm@@ ers Ch@@ en Xin@@ yi , 3000 @-@ Meter hin@@ d@@ rance in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the start of the most critical athle@@ tics competitions , these messages come to the end .
in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de di@@ ure@@ tic was already proven last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
on Friday afternoon , the International Sport@@ gericht@@ shof CAS confirmed its exp@@ ul@@ sion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m butter@@ fly , only around 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze med@@ al .
on Friday , Ch@@ en should have participated in the prec@@ urs@@ ors over 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
at the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) , the opening of the B @-@ Probe and a hearing requested at the International Olympic Committee ( I@@ OC ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very seriously and demands from Ch@@ en full cooperation in investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Xin@@ hua out of a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport@@ gericht@@ shof CAS and will accept the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history , it is no longer the I@@ OC , but CAS is responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio the news broke through the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she was innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be food supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the Ath@@ le@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it should act in the forbidden substance to treat the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova was pro@@ visi@@ onally suspended , according to B@@ NT the B @-@ Probe should already be positive .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w immediately reported on the ath@@ l@@ ete with criticism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sport@@ s@@ men do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have been exp@@ elled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , all weight lif@@ ters from the chronic dop@@ ing @-@ loaded nation can not participate in Rio .
on Friday the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; became known , the London Olympics champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positive on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on three days earlier .
both equ@@ ate the intake , but both are not allowed to start in class up to 94 kg .
before the ath@@ l@@ ete &apos;s start , especially the case Dan@@ ek@@ ova is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
the World Federation IA@@ AF signed the whole Russian team up to an exception because of systematic dop@@ ing , even the nation of Kenya produces a number of bad news in Rio .
in the swimming @-@ sport , the earlier transgres@@ sions in China also ensured intense disputes between the athletes .

developers of black@@ mail @-@ malware are targeted at targeted businesses - and are successful in doing so .
according to a recent survey of the malware defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes among 540 companies in North America , UK and Germany , 40 percent of the survey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once , in part several times victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
40 percent of the victims readily paid the ran@@ ge@@ es required by the perpet@@ rat@@ ors in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rat@@ ors speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes on attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potentially potentially black@@ out ran@@ som is significantly higher than in private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying fast evolution of the malware , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chef Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 , most Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send adverti@@ sements .
then the perpet@@ rat@@ ors discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
only privately users were the target , but the change to company attacks was fri@@ ghtening in the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once active on the computer of an victim , it searches for un@@ altered files such as wor@@ d@@ - , Excel or database files , as well as archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
subsequently , the software presents the requirements of the black@@ mail .
to get the end @-@ key code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of Bit@@ coin Cryp@@ to@@ currencies .
but where in private users the personal photo database is at stake , it is about sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production is still in place .
accordingly higher the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware hits .
22 per cent of the affected German companies reported loss of turnover through ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent even had to break down the business activity , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany , hospitals were already victims of attacks , whose patients can be acute by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t pay , you only fund the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , 80 to 90 percent of firms that pay , get their data again .
for managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors in view of stand@@ still in operation .
the h@@ ackers in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure have examined the areas of use and contact with black@@ heads and come to the conclusion : the perpet@@ rat@@ ors are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain their victims via chat as they can pay via Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support sites , or de@@ cryp@@ t for free sample files .
and if private people are rede@@ emed after payments of a few hundred Euro , companies must partly negoti@@ ate hard and pay five @-@ digit sum@@ s to recover their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potentially high and relatively low risk earnings from ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ackers are becoming more professional and share the work , says security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from anti @-@ virus @-@ provider SOPH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
however , it is likely that it is three or four persons .
the programm@@ ers sell their malware in the form of a software tree box to the actual black@@ mail .
the old malware kits were created by the malware themselves , coun@@ sel@@ ing and additional tools for a single , fixed price between $ 1000 and $ 10,000 .
&quot; included in delivery is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the black@@ berries are then looking for further h@@ ackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
so one logs in one of the forums in the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and asks another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
the payment is made per authentic@@ ated machine .
&quot; usually , the crimin@@ als then apply sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski explains .
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is known by many companies that better secure their data .
over 50 percent of companies IT leaders in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey trust that ran@@ som@@ ware can be rep@@ elled using file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rat@@ ors are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if data encryption is not a sufficient threat to successful earnings , the perpet@@ rat@@ ors thre@@ aten to release sensitive data such as customer lists or price calcul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chef Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the potential for damages , depending on the type of data , is much higher than before .
the perpet@@ rat@@ ors could also make completely new goals on the internet of things in the future .
at Hack@@ er@@ konferenz Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how to get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worthy of a ran@@ som .
if the perpet@@ rat@@ ors then block a whole production road in a factory rather than the heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all eventu@@ alities
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V Honda wants to pack everything : a little SU@@ V , a little cou@@ pé and also the versatility of a mini van .
sounds pretty over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1,60 m high HR @-@ V appears rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row and in the rear , it doesn &apos;t work closely at any place .
the materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cock@@ pit upper side is slightly decl@@ ining .
more versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in the storage box .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only a trunk of 453 l with raised and 10@@ 26 l with revers@@ ed back rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical when it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like k@@ ine@@ tic chairs and thus offer storage space , which is height up to the ceilings of 1.@@ 24 m .
the trunk can be loaded well , but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
Originaltitel : C@@ SI : crime Sc@@ ene Inv@@ estig@@ ation ( TV )
pleas@@ ing is the daily consumption of 4,7 l / 100 km .
there is another engine : a 1.5 @-@ litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the handling is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering should be somewhat more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the top variant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the security systems include the City emergency braking assistance ( working up to Tempo 32 ) , the colli@@ sion warning system and the Lane Assistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the colli@@ sion war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ates because he ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the distance beam assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed controller respon@@ ds to the traffic sign recognition and th@@ rot@@ tles the speed if necessary .
but full connectivity is only available for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch screen , nav@@ i , app integration and more .
two USB and one HDMI socket are located underneath the arm@@ rest and are therefore a bit aw@@ k@@ ward to achieve .
the approximately 29@@ 000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who do not want to invest so much will receive the petrol from 200@@ 00 Euro , diesel from 23,@@ 000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro @-@ 6 emissions standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday driving car .
airline is not liable : fall on air passenger bridge
a airline is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger lift .
the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argu@@ ed that liability is concei@@ vable only in case of dangers which are typical of aviation .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee attack during the fall .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a common risk of life , such as the court .
the airline had to pay no damages to the man .
case of illness : when paid by the organis@@ er
after their journey , ill vac@@ ation@@ ers only get money back when the cause of the disease is to be found without doubt in the hotel .
however , this is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests have proven to show the same symptoms .
in the negoti@@ ated case , a family was severely ill in di@@ arr@@ ho@@ ea and v@@ om@@ iting on the second day of their door@@ mat@@ s .
she spent almost the whole holiday in the room .
their illness brought the vac@@ ation@@ ers back to a defective treatment plant , which suppos@@ edly contam@@ inated the sea water .
the family was the view that the trip was in@@ adequate - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ er .
the compl@@ ain@@ ants had no success in court .
indeed , the sew@@ age treatment was indeed defective .
but the organis@@ er first drove before leaving the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
until then , he had to assume that sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so he did not viol@@ ate his duty of duty , so judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially as in the samples of the water there were no im@@ puri@@ ties found .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by cont@@ ag@@ ion among themselves - belong to the general risk of life .
there were only 38 people from 6@@ 91 guests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , according to the violence perpet@@ rated by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July many people would have worried about further attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state must be pru@@ dent and determined to react to terrorist acts at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is certain that our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors with hate and spl@@ itting .
we will not allow this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if offen@@ ders need to leave the country more quickly , this raises the security and strength as well as the consent of the population for refugee policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to implement the proposals to the 2017 Bundestag &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel rein@@ forcement of security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in average vi@@ cious magn@@ itude over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism must be under punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
video surveillance is to be improved , the law of arms can be enhanced so that the purchase of weapons on the internet is difficult .
the recently discussed Swiss duty of silence for doctors is to remain in accordance with de Mai@@ zi@@ ères &quot; words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the medical profession , how the endanger@@ ment of citizens can be reduced , he said with a look at psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to counter@@ act the radic@@ alisation of refugees , the Minister maintains a better social assistance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ sed people .
in order to prosec@@ ute crimin@@ als in specific areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of conce@@ aled investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to enhancing security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Minister of the Interior clearly spoke against action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this was an ear@@ nest for the sni@@ pers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Medi@@ engruppe ( Friday ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the aboli@@ tion of double citizenship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he considers a general ban on enforcement of enforcement to be constitu@@ tionally problem@@ atic .
you cannot offer everything you reject , and I reject the wearing of bur@@ kas .
you can talk about rules about traffic or for witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green boss Simone Peter designed the Minister to simul@@ ate energy and action with ever new anti @-@ terror pack@@ ets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet humili@@ ation and a shar@@ pen@@ ing of the right of stay bring people in this country no more security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the highway
it is regularly st@@ owed on the surrounding road - here a picture of November .
but this should change : the right @-@ to @-@ end @-@ esp@@ an should be extended .
this is good news for all car drivers who stand in the traffic jam every night at the ambient road , when they drive over the motorway exit Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Landes@@ betrieb Straßen@@ bau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extends the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( August 16 / 17 ) in the area between the Hammer Road and the Wes@@ eler street exit at 700 meters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
drivers can then drive directly from the hammer street to the right .
the big advantage : the traffic con@@ fron@@ ts itself early , thereby improving the overall workflow on the busy section of the federal road 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the regional representative of Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the fe@@ eder anno@@ ys drivers especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the way back to the bridge crosses the Alber@@ sloh way and sometimes also beyond .
the reason is the needle eye on the B 51 just before the Wes@@ eler street exit .
from here the traffic will only be lo@@ wered via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the required load capacity to record double @-@ gauge heavy @-@ load traffic .
how long this bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the associated traffic jam will continue , the competent state shall not be able to say .
however , with years to reck@@ on , the bridge has an official resi@@ dual duration until the year 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal framework , the state farm deliberately chose the weaker time in the school holidays because with disabilities to be reck@@ oned .
the traffic will be guided on the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural travel : cultural activities for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Junge Theater now plan a music project .
N@@ ima &apos;s association allows young people with mig@@ rant and refugee backgrounds to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the nur@@ ser@@ y nur@@ ser@@ y school has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the boy The@@ aters Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; initiated by N@@ ima &apos;s association , 19 students from eleven to 15 years visited the st@@ aging in the small house .
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee backgrounds , offers schools with welcome groups the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project .
most adol@@ escents in the class were come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster .
thanks to the chore@@ ographi@@ es , the scenic pictures and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action nonetheless , so the press release of the boy The@@ aters Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az Wester@@ berg from Spra@@ kel , and the Junge Theater will work together during the coming season as part of a music theatre project .
from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration background are to be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the areas of singing , dancing , acting and music .
special offers for children and families in the area of theatre play and theat@@ rical language medi@@ ation are planned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; continues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
given the increased number of refugees , the association counts with many classes that want to participate .
rain instead of star@@ ving : hope for better weather
the weather made the Stern@@ schn@@ u@@ ppen @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the Sou@@ thwest of Germany in the night to Friday a scre@@ ed through the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was badly suitable for clouds and rain to observe the spectac@@ le &apos;s spectac@@ le , the Chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , said on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather is supposed to be good , then we see a lot of shooting stars in the sky .
the stars of the star are Persi@@ ans , with 216@@ ,000 kilometers per hour to the fastest clu@@ sters of the star .
they have their names because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation of Per@@ se@@ us , which goes up in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips for in@@ som@@ nia
in the evening , one turns around forever , at night you have to wake up for hours , in the morning it is far ahead of the wake @-@ up ring no longer to think of sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , approximately a quarter of adults sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing .
how do sleep problems or sleep disorders occur ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many reasons behind them , says Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , member of the German Society for Schla@@ ff@@ or@@ schung and Schlaf@@ medizin .
what one understands very often is the in@@ som@@ nia , i.e. a single and a sleep distur@@ b@@ ance .
especially the as@@ leep will find many people as un@@ satisfactory or in@@ adequate , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , member of the German Association of Physi@@ cians with Practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el .
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind it , organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also drugs are stuck .
not rare is the sleep distur@@ b@@ ance expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is often common in a depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ eß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors are constra@@ ining each other .
for example , who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disk failure , can lie badly , w@@ akes up every two to three hours and possibly starts to gre@@ et about everyday problems and wor@@ ries , there is an example .
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I go with sleep disorders to the doctor ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and are imp@@ aired on the day should go to the doctor , advis@@ es .
the imp@@ air@@ ment can look very different : one is beaten , tired , un@@ dischar@@ ged , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments such as stomach or head@@ ache .
to alle@@ vi@@ ate the sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , it is important to find out their causes .
as treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or even medicines - classical sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in question .
there is hardly any settled sleep physician in Germany , says Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical center at the Char@@ ité Universitäts@@ medizin Berlin .
for this reason , one should contact the general practitioner in case of sleeping problems .
this can be clari@@ fied with examinations whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to the sleep lab , and what happens ?
for exam@@ ining the sleep laboratories doctor , for example , in snor@@ ing with breathing exercises , in case of sick ti@@ rel@@ ess , with sleep @-@ conver@@ ters , or if one does not find the cause of a distur@@ b@@ ance disorder , explains fever .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just please do not make mid@@ day sleep , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after tasting , you go to bed at his normal time .
beside the electrodes on the body one carries a nas@@ al g@@ og@@ gles , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger .
there is also a camera on the ceiling to sleep .
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which one can set for a better sleep .
wo@@ unding counts : regular sleep and rise times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not sleep television for as@@ leep , alcohol and not watch at night - then one starts to reck@@ on immediately , and that is quite and not condu@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming
former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ ser commented on Facebook for the dis@@ ap@@ pointing cutting of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he was first awarded gold for the first world champion@@ ships in Doh@@ a and at the same time presented his first world record .
now the former DS@@ V ath@@ l@@ ete Markus Dei@@ bler has put himself in front of his ex @-@ team @-@ mates in front of his critic@@ isms .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic winner gets 20,000 € bonus and a jungle @-@ headed 15@@ 0,000 € should not be surprised about missing medals , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page at night .
the conveyor system in swimming @-@ sport is bad , the dop@@ ing controls , on the other hand , very good .
this means that we can not compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look at dop@@ ing as closely or even operate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not saying that here the controls are to be stopped , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he continued . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ tem@@ et would have to be announced nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who cannot be controlled for a certain time before WM / OS from independent inspec@@ tors of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the choice ham@@ burger , who meanwhile operates an ice cream shop . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de of Bag@@ gage Li@@ fting
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
on Thursday , the police arrested two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 .
the susp@@ ects had committed several pocket and luggage theft as a gang .
at 21.@@ 30 civil officials in the area of the airport Düsseldorf saw a gang that was known to the police officers from past theft .
the two women and two men had committed several crimes since the middle of July and were communal , edi@@ t@@ ary and especially professional .
the specialists of the criminal department 34 can demonstrate the thi@@ eves which have specifically entered into Germany to enter crimes , to prove four acts .
in the process , they had a total of more than 15,@@ 000 euros .
old buildings , a few lines of lime trees , meanwhile a rest of cob@@ ble@@ stone streets : the R@@ ī@@ ga Street in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sha@@ in doesn &apos;t look like the first sight , but the police count them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
when one goes along the road from east to west , one passes play@@ grounds , a newly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ aden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the façade of a gray house someone has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spra@@ yed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
opposite of a Li@@ dl that will soon be demoli@@ shed , a house with high windows and 133 new rentals will be built here until 2017 .
article on this &quot; trendy district , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrich@@ sha@@ in calls , will be illustrated in recent weeks , however , with burning cars .
the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rented contracts , but on the ground floor there are still spaces occupied and are used for events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the year , particularly the Berlin In@@ sen@@ ator H@@ enkel had called for a hard action by the police against the project , called the area as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after having cleared the rooms on the ground floor , the cad@@ a@@ ds@@ mi@@ ths , with 300 police officers , the police pat@@ rols three weeks according to official statements , with 30 to 40 officials and three teams on site , locked parts of the street and stopping visitors from entering the house with number 94 .
in the meantime , the building workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners .
on 13 July a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court decided that the clearance was illegal , and a day later the police and construction workers moved away from sympath@@ is@@ ers and residents .
in this summer afternoon the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the pav@@ ement in front of the houses in the sun , others are talking about sp@@ ät@@ tis .
in the immediate vicinity of the building projects are a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Kers@@ tin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who plays three children here , are mainly gener@@ alised by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the Hau@@ tes , they share the concern of rising ten@@ ets and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a neighborhood , who wished for a majority of police protection from the sc@@ andal@@ ous left .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin inter@@ sen@@ ator and the police between household occup@@ ants and their neigh@@ bors make up , obviously does not exist .
Friedrich@@ sha@@ in in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class neighborhood , which even today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and high poverty risk .
in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former G@@ DR , including almost all the Main@@ zer Street close to Riga .
while the Main@@ zer was evacu@@ ated under a regular road , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago .
at the same time , in recent years , the district has become increasingly popular for tourists and elec@@ tors from all over the world : with them residents of G@@ DR times and former hom@@ eless friends are sharing their neighbourhood .
this is also reflected in the r@@ ents which have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in Riga are attacked as symbols for this development : one recogni@@ zes them on the disc@@ arded discs or freshly painted fac@@ ades that have been disc@@ arded with color bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned this year so often together with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ aut@@ on@@ ome violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason for not all neigh@@ bors to consider this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes like bodily injury are almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen .
the largest part of the off@@ ences make property damage which tends to make the newly built and newly renovated houses tend to be .
for Kers@@ tin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rented house for 17 years next to the controversi@@ al 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
as for violence , it is wei@@ ght@@ ful : the people in the 94 are their neigh@@ bors who are not destined to be .
even the famous burning cars are no longer available in Riga .
for the architect , its road is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the road and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has consciously moved to Riga &apos;s street - and stayed .
that is why it was also so important that local residents get their streets back : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all of sudden claimed the sense of interpretation across the district .
but in the eyes of the inhabitants like Neu@@ geb@@ auer the road continues to be taken away from them : through un@@ conventional new@@ buildings in former buildings that displ@@ ace the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are ultimately con@@ dom@@ ini@@ ums which are not interesting for many here - there are rather people who are not so well che@@ ek@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction I can absolutely not appro@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should one do if someone never list@@ ens to it ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , also with the police and the inhabitants .
Kers@@ tin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for tra@@ ilers that anno@@ y themselves about colour bom@@ bs : the Hau@@ tes and the left @-@ hand scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
those who draw , should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a pub area , can badly compl@@ ain about noise there .
all persons named with pre @-@ names have asked to not be called by their right name
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee officer
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee representative for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ ago@@ gue supports the management team by Achim Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees herself as contact person for all actors : refugees , working groups , refugees , administration , authorities and anyone else .
Reg@@ ine customer from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the ze@@ al@@ ous wool @-@ mil@@ chs@@ au , which has a problem above all .
so some - less spot@@ ting rather than on the multitude of fulfilling tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the place .
we are looking for an administrative specialist with a talent for languages and people , associated with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just a ze@@ al@@ ous Woll@@ mil@@ chs@@ au .
but administrative work is not its central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organising , working with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for approximately six weeks .
it has a 50 percent place on three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports up @-@ to @-@ date and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems .
new containers soon standing in the W@@ as@@ enstraße
a serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection service .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have to put the refugees in their own or hired habit@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility is transferred from the Land@@ rat@@ samt to Commun@@ e and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his home .
the search has been very difficult for some time .
de fac@@ to the administration does not find private apartments .
so far , it does not work so far as one depends on private dwell@@ ings , so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , rural apartments have to be not@@ orious as it is so beautiful .
new containers will soon be placed in the W@@ as@@ enstraße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine client and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a permanent lead , there are intern@@ ships , apprentic@@ es@@ hips , school places , one @-@ euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants that need to be gro@@ unded or established .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine client .
many work in the building yard or help house masters , do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very neat , such as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a feeling of belonging .
so I need offers such as sports , contacts with local people and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so also here administration and volunteers are running .
it is central that the refugees have the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they have to explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge the time meaning@@ fully , for example with language courses .
those who develop the feeling som@@ ed@@ ay , he couldn &apos;t help in Ur@@ bach , should not work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate .
the clear majority is motivated .
the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and the customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : did the two of the most recent happ@@ enings fear radic@@ alisation , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reg@@ ine client quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some nai@@ ve call &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these inci@@ dents are also subject to the refugees .
they would have the fear that the attacks bring them completely in ob@@ itu@@ ary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the main and volunteers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must look for activities on the spot and in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they always have in the background that soon a new push of refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
to answer this question clearly , politics is afraid .
actually , it is un@@ fair to put them on the spot .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not arrived yet where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine customer also clearly shows that the Ur@@ bacher is already busy to integrate the existing people sensi@@ bly .
currently , there are about 100 people , mainly young men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if people are in need , they need to help them , both women agree . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .

the ahn@@ dung was without success .
perhaps the unknown , in fact , fell close to the apartment or at its escape .
