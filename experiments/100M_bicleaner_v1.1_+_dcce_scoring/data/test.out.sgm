<seg id="2">"" "" "" "investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade agreement - we want both Clinton and Trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential candidates are at tax and energy policy, as well as in a fundamental issue.</seg>
<seg id="4">Differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">That, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "in doubt, Trump wants to keep in doubt small and warn about how the state can harm the economy - with tax and regulation." ""</seg>

<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will massively withdraw regulations and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, states: the state has certain tasks to fulfil, it has opportunities to open-up opportunities and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why taxes for the rich would increase, they say.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "in which needs to be invested, Trump and Clinton say almost word-like." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate undertakes the greatest investment in new jobs since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are dismissed by the state-critical teaparty wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on Trump, there could be more party discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policies are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the US." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas, the Paris climate protection agreement will announce it.</seg>

<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two contenders are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazific trade agreement, do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "at the same time, both the US do not want to isolate the US from international trade, but simply to better protect American jobs." ""</seg>

<seg id="26">The present minimum wage of $7,25 is a hunger.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must go down, then he says he should not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "but the big discussion of the coming months is probably more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "on the one hand is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics adhere to him so that the budget deficit would only increase.</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every winged woman has experiences with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">Sexual violence is a part of women who are fleeing alone, almost everyday.</seg>
<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house has shelter.</seg>
<seg id="5">Four women sit in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each has a baby that is at most a year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has placed her little son in his arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks inquisitive in the room with big eyes.</seg>

<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you talk with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is an executive director of Condrobs, a carrier of social welfare services in Bavaria, and among other things he deals with the issue of women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich north in one of the few decentralised accommodations for all-winged women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs visited the institution together with Pro Familia and Frauenkirche in Munich.</seg>

<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>

<seg id="31">Here too, single women in refugee-shelters would often be regarded as inferior and abused in the worst.</seg>

<seg id="38">On the question whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction, some respond with no.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, there is no such thing in accommodations of the governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">Even in Swabians alone, winged women are not separated, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Central Franconia there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children.</seg>

<seg id="2">Representatives of the assistants have called upon their union to approve new work campaigns in their disputes with respect to a new contract.</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "Russia and Turkey:" "" "alliance of aliens" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight month long war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated auditorium of St. Petersburg Palace, I can't defend myself from the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was a handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile was smallible and he barely radiated heat, even for his restrained circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke of his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report whole five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day a newspaper stated that Erdogan had behaved as if there had never been anything bad.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed rather to indicate the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable coolness showed that Russia's head of state had nothing to forget.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the contrary, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was wasted.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin spread out and accused Ankara, Russia fell into his back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even greater because it was celebrated by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Rebuilding the Vetrauen is difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media carried out a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time, it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The most serious were the allegations of senior officials that Erdogan had benefited from illegal oil trading in regions of Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin from President Erdogan received the excuse he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the benefits of a cease-fire are clear on the hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needs first and foremost all friends whom he can get after he has been enthralled by a failed coup d "état in almost his ministry last month.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">Tour operators and charter companies in Russia will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late aisonal onslaught of the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week the state television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agrarian imports are again allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti articulated it as follows:" "" "tourists there, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry at the West as it responds to the attempted takeover of power as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">To this end, the continued grudge on the snail-empo of EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pike on it is to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara that he sought after the attempted coup d "état in favour of the elected officials.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this splendid palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portray "alliance of outsiders": two countries that violate the West and are badly treated and are now allied.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "" "" "the greatest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents were told at the press conference that they would not have taken the issue once.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "Turkey's President promised to answer a question about their differences, while Putin has decided to stress it." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on what a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey shook the Russian fighting jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state are talking at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin firmed Stabschef Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ivanov was part of Putin's closest confidant.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a statement of the Kremlin, it is that Putin has ordered the dismissal of Ivanovo from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been a deputy since 2012, has been appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin web site it is called (in Russian) that he later was a log manager and Chief Executive Officer of the government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think that it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of state in respect of bills and controls to implement your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has undergone Moscow secretly.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the closest confidants Vladimir Putins and works like him for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">During a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">Is this the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who once was touted as a potential president at once would like to lead Russian environmental policy - met great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin that are cited on the website of the Kremlin, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, I could say this very complicated post - you could almost say - entrust job for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Bundessicherheitsdienst (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin was in power he named Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was once assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term of office, since Putin had violated Putin's third term of office.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, approaching allies Putins, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister, before he became the President three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers connected the northdeck of the Queensferry crossings to the viaduct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four closures of the" "" "ceiling fans" "", "which are nearing completion for each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>

<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 cranes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion expensive project will be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Economic Minister Keith Brown paid a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go on the bridge from the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historical and symbolic moment in building the Queensferry crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of an engineering of an truly epic extent in this project with more than 30.000 tonnes of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, completion of the sealing between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, almost 79% of the complete deck decks at their place and the final section of the decks today in Rosyth gets a concrete shot for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project leader of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructor, said: "the first clasp is a significant milestone in every bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">In this fantastic project, the closure represents forward-looking high-construction and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last road covering and its connection with the Nordturmdeck currently under construction, we had to close the still existing gap on the north or north side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was reached 700 millimeters south by dragging the northern feeder bridge.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massively, as the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6.000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate as the tolerances on which the team worked, were tiny - on each side they were just a few millimetres.</seg>

<seg id="5">But fight is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost it is about the question: who should actually build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "Dr Christoph Frimann says:" "" "we agree with the Green Party: whoever wants to build on urban areas must in future reject 20 percent of all apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">The cheap apartments, however, can also be found in the inventory.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, the major point in the town hall is, however, as Bratman said: "how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas, but as as 20 percent of the apartments as a social housing." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="17">If the concept of action is implemented, it will take care of additional tasks in the building administration.</seg>

<seg id="20">But the programme does not yet stand entirely: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you compare the loss of other 1,300 affordable apartments whose promotion will expire in the coming years?</seg>

<seg id="29">Only: this does not want the owners, the apartment building companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social housing in the western city is raised again drastically, one removes itself from the goal of so-called interference.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children do not go outside to play outside, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on screens, has been sued by many over the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and becoming more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially on the TV, then video games and most recently restricted to smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters created first for the video games in the 1990s (later emerged from it a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many phenomena in pop culture, the interest in the release of the game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand diminished at the beginning of July something.</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries has been postponed by the massive demand that the servers overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokemon that can be followed by a GPS and once they have been found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the cell) or "captured" can be captured.</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the faucet and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the United States, the game resulted in a considerable increase in steps that the "average" person returns every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch who pursues 35,000 users, recently announced that within two days of the launch of the game, the number of persecuted people who exercise 30 minutes each day, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns for health, people want to take" "" "take 30 minutes" "" "to come from the sofa" "" "and" "" "to be active every day" "" "because many public messages are dull to health and come from people who look elusive." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sports cannot be overvalued.</seg>
<seg id="19">Anyone driving sports regularly reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the miracle of Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine and fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also mürish players who have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has happened a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if Smartphone Apps like Fitbit could have followed our activity earlier, they didn't give us a reason to do sport as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will be omitted with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemons success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world and will help many people to hunt more active, grate and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American Turnerin klomm on Thursday for a multi-battle title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her total score of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the Silver medal winner and Final Five "team member Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medallist Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Americans Simone Biles turnt at the Swedish bar during the solo-campaign of women during the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American woman who wins a multi-campaign title and in total the fifth, while she consolidates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at this moment found an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps who have brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated the last three years her sport, 15 world medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Rescue from her said she is "the best gymnast I have ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">She expected a final examination in Brazil, a competition, which was not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be considered disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after they won gold and silver in the individual multi-camp site of women during the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles took the first medal on Tuesday while she served as exclamation mark on the farewell party of the retired man coordinator Martha Karolyi.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Billie insisted, during their long journey to the top, never planned to have the future planned, this is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of its floor exercises - which includes its typical bedrock pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip in the gym, where Boorman trained, became strength.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, she has lost no more competition competition, a winning series that will continue as long as it wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if Mustafina was easily introduced by two filaments, the picture rinsed.</seg>
<seg id="27">Schwebebalken and Bodenturnen - in which Biles holds the World Championship title.</seg>
<seg id="28">She repeated again with 15,433 on the floating beam - and with a 15,933 on the ground still put one on it.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her softly when she expected her grandchild - a pure formality - and tears streamed bright red, white and blue lashes, as the vision she once described in her book-book, became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">Raisman's performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a Tiebrake.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time the 22-year-old man's capital, which is called "Oma," by the Americans, had a lead.</seg>
<seg id="32">After their soils, she threw himself down to the public, overwhelmed by a comeback, which at times seemed doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="33">As for Biles, the rapidly expanding tweet of the 19-year-olds has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week:</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I present to myself among women's Olympic Games in the gymnasium and that is more than a reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, since 1984 I have been with every summer Olympics and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess and Madison Kocian, who is Catholics, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic feminine presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one under the female gymnast was an Afro American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympiad of Olympics and America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world championships Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they were not expected but masterful Gymastics routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold in an individual campaign for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won Silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but do not look for gymnastics classes throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all hit the same path as Aly and Madison to create it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five" "", "because the next Olympic team will have only four gymnasts in the team. moreover, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnasts are a more expensive sport and gymnasts are primarily in private sports clubs that are maintained by parents who pay for training, orientation, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families). the list can be continued at any time.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gymnastics are in wealthy localities that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the gymnasts receive their entire training and that is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes since they started with the gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We need to aun the municipalities aun innumerable young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more affordable and easily accessible turntable training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnasium of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people (especially black and hispanic) and trains national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality gymnastics that can make the opportunity to learn and benefit from this fantastic Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team who bring thousands of young girls to be interested in gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this true representation of "Girl Power" through the Holen of the Olympic team golf and thanks, you have motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way, healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">The former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office for corruption last year due to corruption from office</seg>

<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets Wahlscandals in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a Special Court decided that the reigning Mayor Lutfur Rahman should be relieved after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his office.</seg>
<seg id="14">The court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way," and that he had silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobic accusations.</seg>

<seg id="18">He expressed particularly alarming about the fraudulent postal code - in which the older members of the Muslim community would have made pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including joining expressions to prove the identity</seg>
<seg id="20">In his report, it says: "as proof it was appropriate that pressure was exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the elderly, especially communities with Pakistani or banglaese background.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We spoke with Rhone Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Verbandes in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at the close distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to rotate the skewer for your predator.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you are approaching from behind you should turn around as first, so that you can see your attacker and "go out of the shot," Mizrachi says.</seg>
<seg id="6">Then grab the gun between your forearm and your shoulder before you face it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then hit him with the knee in the bar and twists, while the attacker is squeezed from pain, the weapon out of his hands. beat him with the run to the face and move backwards while holding the gun on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">For attackers who approach from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot, grab the gun and twist them so that the attacker cannot shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time store the weight on your gun and beat the attacker on your chest, then turn the gun from its grip, before moving backwards and directed the gun to it.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>
<seg id="11">Watch the video to see exactly how it makes Mizrachi.</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveller Ian Wright schabt for a travel guide his tongue to the dirtiest places in Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller underwent his immune system and stranglehold of a serious test by leaking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shook his course on a Euro bills, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing button on a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resistance of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before emptying any object he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he is going to do.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought to strip the flushing button of a traction toilet, which was already used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately nothing left what he delights, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright became known to test the resilience of his intestines by travelling through the world and ate peculiar and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public railways to railway stations to rinsing knobs of toilets, the task placed his immune system definitely under a rehearsal</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "in the film he told:" "" "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he was able to do justice to his call.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its sample score showed a luminance of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the Luminating number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to refuse after their luminating number was over 4000 units while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film" "" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" "", "which shows the number of bacteria at different places like the bathroom." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "this comes close to the worst thing I've done in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm not going to lick here because it's disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company provides Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "" "we wanted to offer consumers something new." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to see and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "we conducted crazy brainstorming that ended that we said" "" "Let us call Ian" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary, we were able to provide the consumer with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film directing, added: "let me tell me so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I had ordered him to lick, just like the ecelusive Russian toilet that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things where it was easier to get Ian to lick her and others, in which this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio, 84 per cent of all respondents of lactic acid bacteria associated with the well-being of the stomach and the intestines and 58 percent said they might at least occasionally use products containing lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">A asozial family left her social housing after a delogation with a damage of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a long list of complaints from her estate, Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown into Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After being removed from their property, employees of the housing association found their property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls showed afflicted holes, wooden boards were ripped, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family were resettled and it is assumed that they are now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people don't have to live in this way." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider since this property is presumably considered as not so beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is too.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had added, street fighting with baseball slats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive cries, strides and flukes included.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skelby, 47 whose name was on the lease, received an arrangement for anti-social behaviour in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house which may be torn down, old garbage has been found</seg>
<seg id="14">In the estate where drugs were traded in the past, the wood-prawns were ripped up</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the streets and regularly calling the police</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing delogated her and her partner this week by the property after giving them an extended term of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delogation were cheered by lightened neighbours who said that their lives were made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "one said," "" "They were not afraid of anyone." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said it would have agreed to cooperate with the local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police were called regular intervals for 20 years</seg>
<seg id="26">On the overgrown site of the community house, garbage and old toys were thrown down</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he added:" "" "it is a disgrace that the tenant has agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family, since a delogation is always the last step to consider Cornwall Housing." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case, because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be dreadful for their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work that my team, the Devon and Cornwall police and members of the community who have courageously assigned to us and have given us the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "I hope that this development will give consolation to some neighbours and the message conveys that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated." ""</seg>

<seg id="33">Workers of the property management will now have to waste garbage mountains that surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">In 2014, the police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as balances, paraphernia and cash in the amount of £1,700.</seg>
<seg id="35">Skelby received a fine-term penalty after the possession of a drug of class B was found guilty of trading.</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skelby, who came to life in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="37">After having been without shelter, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.</seg>
<seg id="38">Many room walls of the house were engraved with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police says that she will delogate tenants who do not stick to the house rules</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow from the Devon and Cornwall police told that the delogation was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not stick to the house rules.</seg>

<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, they have understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021 the country election will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schweriner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>

<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be convinced by the electoral fighters, are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the vacationists who are in the land, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not local, so are not allowed to choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: during the holidays, helpers, the posters, inflate air balloons, flatten the flyers and count out voices in the end, only laboriously apply.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until 4 September 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to pass a campaign for an election victory shortly to the people over itself.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun.</seg>

<seg id="13">What is exciting is how badly Neuling AfD is cutting off and what remains at the end of the coalition-august.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost inconspicuous acting election campaign, one sees from his big posters.</seg>

<seg id="18">The CDU with its Spitzenkandidaten, the Minister of the Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is to make election campaigns at the right time at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale documentations; Merkel's constituency-circle is located in the north-east.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the speed, with which the B 27 is rehabilitated there is nothing to complain about.</seg>

<seg id="8">The devaluation of those responsible for the construction work will also be praised, for instance when it comes to setting up residence housings.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site was migrated to the south on Monday and also the locking of the asphalt road in Ofterdingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg is restored, the traffic situation within the village has relaxed.</seg>

<seg id="13">The inhabitants of Bachstrasse, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many creeping paths were looking and more familiar to their navi than the signage.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas were franchising.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the speed limits were not met, the municipality also called for the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>

<seg id="20">For the businessmen at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But that the B 27 refurbishment has led to sales breaks, everyone can look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">Anyone who has less to do with the "end customer," i.e. for other companies, has hardly any consequences for the rehabilitation.</seg>

<seg id="26">The most powerful are the locals along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of Steakhouse, formerly Crown, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "not only him, but all the restaurants have made it tough." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have responded differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, government President Jörg Schmidt responds to a request from Göhner, whether it could give a financial compensation, otherwise the restaurant benefited from the advantages of the location at the B 27. now, they must also bear the drawbacks that result from the rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="37">GÖHNER knows from other counties, where something more generous has been handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">With all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been here since 1715, pointing to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">That other regular guests are now less frequented because of the complicated traffic management, he can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you cannot come here, it is also somewhere else nice.</seg>
<seg id="42">That his tribal climate comes back after the end of the renovation work, Göhner has no doubt.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner thinks the effects of the B 27 construction work on its clientele for the biggest crisis that its hostess experienced in its many years of history.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle aged love records.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you hurry to the comment section to sow him under the pseudonym of non-allele men's accomplishments, this statement derives from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the much-discussed resurgence of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in millennials that want to welcome the newness of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight in the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyers group.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers retain their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on TV, I would follow the camera while in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit, and wild, before I steal, hold my hands and something determining like: "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Sohos is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic panel-specialty shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, I of Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (numbers: eight men middle age, a woman, probably around the 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I guess already," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I did not follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford than they appeared and buy objects he sold when he was young and plainly.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60's, early 70's, who appeared when I was 11 or 12. things in which I probably was too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records, are more introverted and like to spend time alone, and add: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my disaster.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers, whom he meets, apply to YouGov's profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and have seen themselves to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I conducted, people generally emptied themselves around 1998 or 1999 of their collection.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records in order to buy CDs, sell their CDs now to buy their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of trailers of the record auditor of a particular age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers were impacting the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to pull back to the stability of familiar vinyl records, from objects that evoke happy youth memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of a emptiness or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," "" "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector so and I think it's like that with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way of being mentally engaged.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "a staff of a record pile." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet heard them.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use while 7% of those who buy a record, do not possess a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried, while I was more blurred by a pile of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (number of data: three middle-aged men) has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revivals.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone came here recently and said:" "" "I don't have a record player, but I'd like to buy a radio-board sound plate so that I can put them into the shelf," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less musically.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people saying," "" "I have no record player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones who only slowly come into being.</seg>
<seg id="44">Whip that has dedicated the Schallplatten to almost a whole floor has a colorful audience when I go.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts's latest synthesizer and sexe-packed pop instead of experimental jazz pampered from the speakers - it's good to see such diversity with the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but nagging psychic traumas are hard to imagine, if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a shopping spree as a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">She does not earn much, therefore collecting sheets is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records... "she drives with a dearest sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record enthusiasts: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I pretend to be brave the jeans-leather pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who group for a moment to group Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a cross-board player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of tiles from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential panels for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody can see them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative, some so far up that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "it is pure" "" "plate art" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as sheets.</seg>
<seg id="61">Although my research explores that the results of YouGov agree, they are not considered, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors, who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They will certainly not spend their Thursday morning with the ramble through plates of the Berwick Street and the leaves by plates while they avoid the staring gaze of an uncanny, 30-year-old false moderator, who rises above the shoulders nothing insulating middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected a proposal from the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the Calais Jungle, where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">In case of a trial hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorized to sell 72 temporary business in which people sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, sell, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais prefecture argued that these places were to be broken down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and that harbor a risk of fire and sanitation.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals that are offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run 72 provisional business, but admitted that the concerns of Calais's prefecture are "absolutely comprehensible."</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "the judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than just to feed people who" "" "live in extremely precarious conditions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by the rains was the Jungle Book Kids' Café des Lagers, which is charitable and 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum causes for hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the kids' café.</seg>
<seg id="12">In a letter to the Guardian, it meant that the closing "for these children would be a catastrophe, of which the youngest eight years are old."</seg>
<seg id="13">The two help organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants appreciated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle of the jungle has risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in newcomers over the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at 7-year-old rugby came to a abrupt halt in the final hurdle in the form of Fijis on Thursday evening when they were struck with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji passed a master class in handling, side-quilting, push back, line run, and raw power to gain gold - its first Olympic gold medal of any colour.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was defeated by the not too bad consolation price of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could fall back on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of this, Fiji would have defeated a 15-man team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It might be a consolation for GB - but it probably won't - that at least one Briton tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind it.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago she lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they just lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This flap will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderfully and let the attacks of GBs bounce out of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. an as if you were running in driving buses. the World Series winners went up 5-0 to the top when Osea Kolinisau was overcrowded.</seg>
<seg id="14">With even four minutes of play, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and UK barely touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A fractions of Mitchell picked up the Berg of Man Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute, jasa veremalua lete a touch down in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the reanpfiff and there was still over a minute of playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou pressed through further weak tacklings of the GB team and stormed down to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is like Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB is still stoned.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB resulted in fundamental changes to half-time and closed the fijianic gap... for whole four minutes, which was good for the circumstances of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova passed through a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went out for a long time in favor of the South Seas whose fans were singing, paving flags and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliams put the i-dot with another try in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle tapped, the Fijis embraced themselves and GB kicked devastating in the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day, Fiji Japan defeated Japan in the semifinals with 20-5 and Britain urged South Africa in a scarce semi-final match from the race - Great Britain's conversion of difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the boks in the first half to the front, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate under the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late Tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by the fight with the Cancer of the trainer to a rudder victory</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no more emotined gold than with these games, and that is what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first rudder to the last, 220 severe Hieve going into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if there were only those who sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was all present when she came to the second Olympics in a row without a tax woman, the first women in the history of the British Sports who laid on such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her dominance was absolutely, after all her 39.ter is unmoved, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athletes slipping over the surface with the elegance of sponges, which does not reflect the nature of the triumph.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in rowing there is a battalion of willing helpers who make a difference to the incremental advances that make the difference and there was no more lifting than the trainer who didn't know 30 months ago, if he was diagnosed this day at all, when diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, which is operable and that did it.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if that is the right term in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I needed to get better soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it starts.</seg>

<seg id="2">The crisis-driven and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared by additional costs in millions of millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that are threatened by the industry from green electricity subsidies are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It remained in the release of the renewable energy revolution in the existing systems for the so-called self-current production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister of Agriculture Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years of tough negotiations." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="8">Gabriel said the WAZ, there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with competitive commissist Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators in the steel works are replaced, an EEG levy of 20 percent is required.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also this will not be raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's unification with the European Commission for power generation.</seg>

<seg id="26">At last ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude the closing of individual works.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing does seniors good</seg>
<seg id="2">The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp for her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teacher's studies she occupied the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors-choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing is moving - emotional and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful, and a total of more living, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">At the same time, she does something good for her health and spirit.</seg>
<seg id="6">For Singen is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German Seniorenliga.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">By regular cooperation, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures solve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "" "to speak and organize, to be able to rely on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For doing so, seniors exercise a deep and controlled respiration.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand their lungs are not so fast from the bust in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to getting the sound of voice at age, singing is an ideal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">For elderly people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Foundation of the seniors organizations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, the joint singing had a much higher value; it belonged to everyday life, both at school and in leisure time, explains it.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in elderly people arouses many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their adolescence.</seg>
<seg id="18">Due to lyrics and especially melodies, people suffering from dementia are relieved of long departing events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, a special power is required to the head, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time concentrating on one's own voice and a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially elderly people who live alone practice so not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through singing in the choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Self-esteem is also growing through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I do something for a long time, I become better and grow beyond me - strengthen this experience.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks of having little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes wrong?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a seniors choir, one can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views over the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in an ecclesiastic choir can contact the church or the church leaders directly.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found via the internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you don't have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbors can ask for help in the internet search.</seg>
<seg id="35">If you want to sing, you should necessarily join a choir, rät Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to all ages.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf, the sewage fee will be increased once more, if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a pertinent calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 euros per cubic meter.</seg>
<seg id="4">As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, during the approval of the budget by the Kulmbach country council, it was ascertained that subdivides were incurred for these wastewater facilities.</seg>
<seg id="5">On the basis of legal basis, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the plants cost-effectively.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of 1 October 2016, citizens and industrial companies from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to reach deeper into the purses.</seg>
<seg id="7">The rate increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">Like Herbert Schmidt, the Board of Directors, a new calculation of fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undercover from the previous period of calculations may be compensated.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt started the serious incidence of charge in all three wastewater facilities in order to handle relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack, which lie between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, due to the low distribution basis, for example expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious effect.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the wastewater volume in all three plants is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the previous period of the calculation, all three plants were not last noticed due to their age refurbishment and repair expenses.</seg>
<seg id="14">The facility in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt pointed out that in the sewage plant Azendorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced because of damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the pump station Welschenkahl, the nearly 20 years old conveyor systems had to be overhauled and in the pond treatment plant Lopp had to dispose of the first sewage sludge after nearly 20 years of operation, the sewage sludge had to be disposed and an additional venting possibility will be installed in order to comply with the water legal requirements in the future.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" effect as an Asian caricature criticises</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to breeds.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filtering tool, it allows for Snapchat about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that borders on the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are unique, self-supporting tools generating more than 30 million selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All the aberrations reach the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past in which they were accused of promoting the App Blackface pumping or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week, some users suggested a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and darker cheeks, some critics called a racist caricature from Asians - "Yellow-face."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies were pointing to a bigger problem that the company has a diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and outrage were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat, that it would have deactivated the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company was an excuse: the filter was intended as a homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of injurious clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others refused the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani wrote a Korean-American art student, whose tweet was widely spread over the photos that the filter was "violating and lapped" uncomfortable. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "she added that" "" "it is difficult to argue with the confrontation of a very contradictory Asian caricature and the filtering effects." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellow-proof, but that the yellow light has been pulled into the cutting extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural tunnel wire.</seg>
<seg id="18">The American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchat's big audience young people - who are more diverse in race than their older opponents - could expect to expect sensibility more likely.</seg>
<seg id="20">When one of Snapchats filters produces an image that is insulting for a user, "it is much more difficult that such things stay unnoticed than it was the case before," the 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete their snapchat account and others on to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for media and in a telephone interview, she said she believes that raced controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the modeling practices at Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticised the large part white, only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it."</seg>

<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence-based information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the actual conditions allowed on the spot, reported an inquiry committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the Republican Members of the Discretory Committee, secret service committees and the military budget committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how hierarchies changed their assessments to the American efforts in the struggle against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "intelligence-based information, typically sent off by high-ranking CentCom Commander ships, regularly drawn a positive image of American efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence agencies," "" "quoted a newspaper article." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "what happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," "" "Ken Calvert, republican member of the House of Representatives, stated." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership mistakes in the CentCom range from the top to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-sided report presents detailed constant problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there are no direct indications that government spikes have given instructions under Obama to change reports, it shows how analysts exposed the pressure from their faces to draw an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before the congress were much more positive than it equals to the facts." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CentCom has publicly announced that a military re-conquest of Mossuls could already commence in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mossul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "after months of investigation, so much is clear." "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congress member from Kansas, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of 2015, the leaders of Central Command changed the intelligence reports to bring down the danger of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force to life after they were playing that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights while the investigation will continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of the CentCom reports are underway by the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="18">On Thursday, democratic Members of the intelligence service published their own findings, which agree with some of the conclusions of the republican task force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, CentCom has created an excessively limited process for the compilation of intelligence-based assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," announced the highest-level democrat in the committee, member of the representative house Adam B. Schiff, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process, so Mr. Schiff," "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "Damaged morality among analysts and" "" "gave excessively little room for divergent opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats stated that there was no evidence of a White House's intervention in the CentCom Analysts in terms of" "" "certain political opinions" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "the preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by" "" "The Daily Beast." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon's general inspector, who were contacted after complaints by CentCom Analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on Congress, while the investigation of the General Inspectorate was still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also stated that" "" "experts sometimes have divergent opinions on interpreting complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">Investigations have repercussions about the question of a successful air campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the ministry of defence).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the allegations of the past year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminded me of dissensions of more than ten years ago, as a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a script about how the then government under George W. Bush foresaw the recommendations of many analysts only a small crew of occupation in Iraq and little time on it to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker to indicate that contrary to the government's declarations of air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State, they had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, because these Provisional refineries had put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, this recognition has not been published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms damaliger commandments, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature because of his excessive positive appraisal of the war situation at a hearing in front of the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel during the Central Command.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the middle of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late as it is, the Olympic Games are.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro stand continually and inevitably, a rapid change between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod that is passed from the bracelets to the swimmer to the triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to the talk of your neighbor in the coffee shop without hearing Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is part of the Olympic Games for the first time and a women's black with dimples, could have definitely been among these well-known names being sent to Prime Time by sponsors and well-being TV advertising if he would be a swimmer, gymnast or even fencers.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the olympic trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate each event alike.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partially in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognised: air duster shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast-swim and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I have a modest argument for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although jumping on trampolines has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years it was so sparsely perceived that many who, I had questioned, did not know that it is at all an Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes for competition, there has never been a medal in the trampoline jumping and until 2012 has had an athlete who has made it to the final.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians who share for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">Jumping on the trampoline has a certain outsider charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a dedicated enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never-ending impact-impact - but also the Grazie of gymnastics and diving, the two sports which it essentially combines.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging victors jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot nearly up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, hedge and salted) before they land on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "they are assessed according to the official Olympic program according to version, difficulty level and" "" "flight time." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists must continue in their quest for gold further, faster, upward and above, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and back, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They hunt not only the finish line or the base wall, but also in television transmission another polite goal: that of the world or the Olympiarekords.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented aspiration is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it's enough to even stir a spectator into tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feel tiring when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline jumper is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward motion is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she prallt, apparently weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no vaults in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming around 13.00 Eastern Time; most of the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final rounds as part of an afternoon block from 14.00 onwards.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of Olympia-mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can be achieved only by the Angus and the objectification of male athletes - as it recently proposed the male US gymnasts to the The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital of Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but an example of democracy - human rights organizations have continually led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, while dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>

<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold regarding the power of the governing coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a lengthy critical election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions continue to rise along the border with Eritrea; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which were more or less defeated in recent years, could use the turmoil and re-armed.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness tend to explode after years of intoxication under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">In recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become increasingly common and improved internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocked access to Facebook and Twitter what they do at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate about internet proxies hiding where they stop.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians commented that they were so too protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia largely to Christian highlands, prospered in politics and economy while they exploited the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But even this is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are here to coordinate under a screen," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The greatest protests took place in the areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfair dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which accounts for about 6 percent of the population, dominant in the military, intelligence services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, has until his death at a non-publicized illness in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly experienced in perceiving early signs of discontent and using special officers to manipulate enemies and to make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime is lacking in this basic skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively minor reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of security services controlled by the Tigers.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia had experienced such a upheaval in 2005, after thousands of elections protested, according to the statements made by analysts, apparently by the government and then stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the subsequent raids many protesters were killed, even if they were less than in the last months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as their measurable progress in poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg id="53">But evidently this has not prevented the intensification of the internal misgivings of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And she assumes a dangerous ethnical form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month's protesters in Gondar, an amharan city, run by Tigray, and the hatred of the Tigray becomes more and more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for scheduled flights over the neighboring Somalia, even if it recently announced that it closed this base.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains Obama's claim that ISIS has been founded "Sarkasmus"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump attempted to dispel the last controversy on Friday that surrounds his campaign by saying that his repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, would be the "founder" of the Islamic State's terrorist group, not seriously meant.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions about the communication abilities of the Republican presidential candidates as to whether he is able to communicate clearly and comprehensible with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his comrades who endeavour to take care of him during an eventful phase of protection, in the peculiar position of explaining statements that he could not have meant at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">After he made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump retired in reference to the claim on Thursday and insisted on interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that President and Mrs. Clinton would have created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was the contrast to the previous day, on which Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews he said the accusation completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt Mr Trump wanted to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidency wanted nothing to know about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism prevails on Mr. Trump, while trying to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling surveys on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton came speeches to the economic situation in Michigan in this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump tried again to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Talking about Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech dull.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already introduced sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he drew a strong criticism when he thought that the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs. Clinton, but he later declared "Of course," I thought it was sarcastic. "</seg>

<seg id="17">But I think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defying the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has taken an unprecedented note, as his survey values continue to decline.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a leading edge in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and head-to-head-race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump fails to apologize for his provocative remarks, he often accused his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humor.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he reinforces the focus of attention during the last few months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze brought his loyal co-workers into the uncomfortable situation, regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent intercessors, gave a great effort to defend the candidate in a CNN interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I think what he says are legitimate, political comments," "" "Mr Giuliani said he was questioned about the correctness of Mr. Trumps's statements, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>

<seg id="25">Most mainstream-republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as foreign minister, allowed ISIS to spread herself by undertaking control of the situation in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="26">In front of the election campaigns in Pennsylvania, Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being routed on each of his words and to be prejudiced against him.</seg>

<seg id="1">Grönland - the oldest cyclone is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland's sharks get offspring with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely, the Grönland sharks at the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean, in an hour it comes at an average straight 1,220 meters.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes to it, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to satte 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifelong lifestyle, however, seems to be a recipe for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at any rate from a Grönland shark who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," Alexander Scheuerlein comments from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist had already suspected that Greenland's sharks become stone-old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland's sharks are hard to observe, after all, they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in winter at the surface.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the habitats of the Greenland-sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their slow-pentagus measured it when they equiped six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitsbergen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, these sharks do this sharks: in the stomach of a animal researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jaw bone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice-sea and seek cadaver, that from higher water layers down torques.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland-sharks that fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 in Greenland or Svalbard as a bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 cm long while the biggest 502 cm size was measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of animals, they analyzed the lenticular nucleus of the sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is already born before the birth of the sharks, the protein contained in it will no longer be renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably a lot of carbon-14 in the lenticular nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, as a nuclear weapon search for greater quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third smallest animal of 220 centimeters, the lenticular, on the other hand, enthrones a low surplus of carbon-14 from the atomic weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All larger Greenland-sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 amounts, which originate from cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493-centimeter long Grönland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record-shark is likely to be 392 years old with 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="29">The fact that Grönland-females got up later, when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers of the length could assign an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland-sharks with the multiplication became apparent at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">Also this is likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusalemes live mainly in icy waters is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211-year old Greenland whale, in whose bacon at the neck had a 120-year old harpoon point, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the living animals often runs on asparagus.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often very big.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible," "" "explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">On the other hand, a very large animal should invest its resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together, four stages were dealt with.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the period up to the next romance journey of every minister in a presumably two years, the top-level round St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimages were checked and one decided finally for the bishop's city of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, with the open gate of mercy on Freiburg's Münster a special pilgrimage destination was offered.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis from Bittelbronn, Greene, and Haigerloch, and Shalom, set themselves in the way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening before, pastor storost sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim crosses and parted the pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb it was driven by train to the starting point Villingen, where also a Münster unserer Lady is standing and so the pilgrimage from Münster was started.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening, depending on a short impulse with various prayers, songs and typefaces.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the Minis made a stop at field crossings, chapels or churches to sing together a song from a specially assembled Pilgrim song.</seg>
<seg id="11">The local parishes were available for the overnight stays.</seg>
<seg id="12">Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller attended the stage destinations for a tasty and powerful dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the second day we continued on Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">After that, one stepped into the stage to St. Peter, which was the most exhausting stretch, but at first some 500 metres of altitude had to be climbed and then climbed again.</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a joint barbecue at the lake of Badweiher in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrimage church in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter it went to the final stage to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">A visibly facilitated and happy the Minis arrived at the Freiburg cathedral in the late afternoon and went through the gate of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">With a little stimulus, God was given thanks.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the Evening Mass in Münster, the Minis of cooperator Markus Obert were welcomed at the Pilgrimage's destination.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service the pilgrims were able to view the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner last night in the men team-Sprint in the Velodrom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the London 2012 title.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor, which his fellow Sir Chris Hoy had turned to Eigen. the Jungspund made the legend proud when he went home to visit a victory from New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after seeing only a modest sixth place in London in March at the London Underground World Championships in London.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a hindrance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hody's retirement generated a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed as they saw potential in the Scots that now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - four years ago with Hoy Winner - and Skinner played an Olympiarekord in the qualification laps, but in the standard races the New Zealanders won in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hinder came back after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner kept it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A strategy change made a great part of the transformation, when passing in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked at his position as a BBC expert and liked Skinner, Kenny and Hinder when they stepped on the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it is a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We placed an olympic record in the final round and defeated the world champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph of 2012 on the side Kenny and Hoys, Hinder claimed that after a weak start he intentionally fell on the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He returned this statement later and there was no objection to England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Hinder said," "" "It feels with the whole UK flags on the grandstand like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team over the past three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have gone so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of ten titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the cycle of Velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of Kenny, it is in the realm of the possibility that he repeated Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who also was born on March 23 (a seemingly holy date for British sport; on that day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is equal to that of Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the Sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said:" "" "I just enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels somewhat lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "Hinder said:" "" "if he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in four-four kilometer racing.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the destination in 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The World Record that won Gold in 2012 was 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had fought yesterday with representatives prior to the qualification, when functionaries called him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the appropriate Women's Competition, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on its strong track team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to pick a par of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">In the background, drama was played in the background, so the resignation of Shane Sutton's technical leader in April, in the midst of Selling and Mobbings, as well as retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">But if you see the first evening of the competition in Velodrom, it looks quite like that, as the legendary reputation of GTT, who has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces of workers - are at stake, as the plant operator terminate the energy supply contract and thus lift all supply contracts as the energy company delivering supplies.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years runs in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2,000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 workstations - direct and indirect - could be endangered at a closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effects, as the melt is consumed about 10 percent of the total power generation of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa completed the Point Henry Melting, which led to a close-up of the Anglesea power station last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The smelting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the price of electricity for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium meltey with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, shared that three more owners will announce their contracts.</seg>

<seg id="14">"" "AGL continued to say that the contracts were so-called" "" "hedging transactions" "" "that should have come into force in November 2016." ""</seg>

<seg id="18">AGL shared that it has already written the value of the contracts in its annual subscription to the amount of $187 million in "anticipation of a dismissal."</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "Alcoa said the decision to extradite the contracts, the" "" "ability of Alcoas... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt" "" "does not impair." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said that it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which would have come into effect from November this year, even if it is still an explanation why it resigned from the contract.</seg>

<seg id="15">But even at the low chance that Mrs. Jenner - which is described by the magazine as the "break-out model" of its generation - falls under the former category, it is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or adolescents from today who know how to turn a good snapchat video (even if everything is true to Jenner).</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was probably inhabitable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at Goddard Institute for Space Studies of the NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus by means of tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether Venus could have revealed similar conditions with their hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that the Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and still rotating slowly.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protected from evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun which was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow revolution of Venus exposes its day-side of the sun for almost two months," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts as a umbrella to shield the surface from most of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degree cooler than the ones of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution that had previously been suspected by planetary researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably habitable, Venus -- over the course of several billions years --was exposed to heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was fired from ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">When their hydrogen escaped, there remained only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect - Venus, the way we know it today.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotational rates under the stars of the star cluster of the Pleiades.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data can help astronomers understand why stars in star clusters rotate at different rates as well as in what context the rotation periods stand with the planetary formation.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that through comparing our results with other stars, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The star cluster of the Pleiades is 445 light-years distant from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this cluster, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now turning the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak rotation rates, these strapping stars push large amounts of starvation.</seg>
<seg id="9">As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star fails, its rotation rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star-spot -- like sunspots -- recognizes.</seg>
<seg id="12">The latest catalogue of rotational rates suggests that more massive stars revolve more slowly than less massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull compares the stars with dancers, while larger stars revolve more slowly than smaller ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the Ballet of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotors tend to be massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the star cluster of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotational rates.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the cluster of the Pleiades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="17">We would like to learn more about how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and, so to speak, hang up their "dance shoes."</seg>

<seg id="1">Olympia 2016: chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekova and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases</seg>
<seg id="2">Caught: because of a positive doping test, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland in Rio should not start.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.</seg>
<seg id="4">A literal athlete would have won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">The first official doping events in Rio de Janeiro have become known before the seventh competition day.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese swimmers Chen Xinyi, 3000-Meter hindrance in Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and the Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the start of the most critical athletics competitions, these messages come to the end.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide diuretic was already proven last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Friday afternoon, the International Sportgerichtshof CAS confirmed its expulsion from the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday the 18-year-old had occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly, only around 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen should have participated in the precursors over 50 m Freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the opening of the B-Probe and a hearing requested at the International Olympic Committee (IOC).</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "the national association takes the matter" "" "very seriously and demands from Chen full cooperation in investigations," "" "said Xinhua out of a message:" "" "we will cooperate with the International Sportgerichtshof CAS and will accept the judgment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history, it is no longer the IOC, but CAS is responsible for the sanction of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also in the night of Rio the news broke through the positive rehearsal at Danekova, the 33-year-old went to the offensive itself.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," "" "this is an incredible shock," "" "she said to the Bulgarian TV station BNT." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "she was innocent," "" "the only explanation could be food supplements," "" "explained the Athletics." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, it should act in the forbidden substance to treat the blood doping agent EPO.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekova was provisionally suspended, according to BNT the B-Probe should already be positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissow immediately reported on the athlete with criticism.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "I don't understand why the sportsmen do not draw the right conclusions," "" "he said:" "" "we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have been expelled." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, all weight lifters from the chronic doping-loaded nation can not participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Friday the case "Adrian Zielinski" became known, the London Olympics champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positive on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon three days earlier.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both equate the intake, but both are not allowed to start in class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before the athlete's start, especially the case Danekova is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The World Federation IAAF signed the whole Russian team up to an exception because of systematic doping, even the nation of Kenya produces a number of bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the swimming-sport, the earlier transgressions in China also ensured intense disputes between the athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">So the Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang in harsh conditions.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: so perfide erpresses Hacker ihr Lösegeld</seg>
<seg id="2">Developers of blackmail-malware are targeted at targeted businesses - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey of the malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, UK and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once, in part several times victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">Euromonitor International has over 40 years' experience of publishing market research reports, business reference books and online information systems.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims readily paid the rangees required by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackmail software according to the observations of Malwarebytes on attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially potentially blackout ransom is significantly higher than in private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we are currently watching a terrifying fast evolution of the malware," "" "explains Malwarebytes-Chef Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "World." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most Malwareprograms were still designed to send advertisements.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only privately users were the target, but the change to company attacks was frightening in the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once active on the computer of an victim, it searches for unaltered files such as word-, Excel or database files, as well as archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently, the software presents the requirements of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the end-key code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of Bitcoin Cryptocurrencies.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where in private users the personal photo database is at stake, it is about sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production is still in place.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly higher the damage occurs when a ransomware hits.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 per cent of the affected German companies reported loss of turnover through ransomware, 13 per cent even had to break down the business activity, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, hospitals were already victims of attacks, whose patients can be acute by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims:" "" "don't pay, you only fund the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of firms that pay, get their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in view of standstill in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure have examined the areas of use and contact with blackheads and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims via chat as they can pay via Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support sites, or decrypt for free sample files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private people are redeemed after payments of a few hundred Euro, companies must partly negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to recover their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively low risk earnings from ransomware blackmail, the hackers are becoming more professional and share the work, says security expert Chester Wisniewski from anti-virus-provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write ransomware about within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is likely that it is three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malware in the form of a software tree box to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The old malware kits were created by the malware themselves, counseling and additional tools for a single, fixed price between $1000 and $10,000.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included in delivery is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackberries are then looking for further hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logs in one of the forums in the underground, buys the set of a criminal and asks another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made per authenticated machine.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually, the criminals then apply spammers with the spread," Wisniewski explains.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of companies IT leaders in the Malwarebytes survey trust that ransomware can be repelled using file-back-ups and scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if data encryption is not a sufficient threat to successful earnings, the perpetrators threaten to release sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculators," "" "explains Malwarebytes-Chef Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">In this way, the potential for damages, depending on the type of data, is much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">The perpetrators could also make completely new goals on the internet of things in the future.</seg>
<seg id="43">At Hackerkonferenz Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how to get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worthy of a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block a whole production road in a factory rather than the heating in the future, Ransomware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="5">Although the only 1,60 m high HR-V appears rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row and in the rear, it doesn't work closely at any place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect, only the cockpit upper side is slightly declining.</seg>

<seg id="10">The trunk can be loaded well, but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-l diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>

<seg id="21">The distance beam assistant works very reliably.</seg>

<seg id="23">But full connectivity is only available for the top features: 7-inch touch screen, navi, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and one HDMI socket are located underneath the armrest and are therefore a bit awkward to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips for insomnia</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening, one turns around forever, at night you have to wake up for hours, in the morning it is far ahead of the wake-up ring no longer to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, approximately a quarter of adults sleep disturbances and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disorders occur?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many reasons behind them, says Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the German Society for Schlafforschung and Schlafmedizin.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one understands very often is the insomnia, i.e. a single and a sleep disturbance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Especially the asleep will find many people as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the German Association of Physicians with Practice in the Lower Saxony Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it, organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also drugs are stuck.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rare is the sleep disturbance expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is often common in a depression," "" "says Weeß." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors are constraining each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, who has a herniated disk failure, can lie badly, wakes up every two to three hours and possibly starts to greet about everyday problems and worries, there is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I go with sleep disorders to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and are impaired on the day should go to the doctor, advises.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look very different: one is beaten, tired, undischarged, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate the sleep disturbance, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or even medicines - classical sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in question.</seg>
<seg id="22">There is hardly any settled sleep physician in Germany, says Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical center at the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">For this reason, one should contact the general practitioner in case of sleeping problems.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified with examinations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to the sleep lab, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For examining the sleep laboratories doctor, for example, in snoring with breathing exercises, in case of sick tireless, with sleep-converters, or if one does not find the cause of a disturbance disorder, explains fever.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "just please do not make midday sleep," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">Former German swimmer Markus Deiser commented on Facebook for the disappointing cutting of the DSV team at Olympis.</seg>
<seg id="3">In December 2014, he was first awarded gold for the first world championships in Doha and at the same time presented his first world record.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has put himself in front of his ex-team-mates in front of his criticisms.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in a country where an Olympic winner gets 20,000 €bonus and a jungle-headed 150,000 €should not be surprised about missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page at night.</seg>
<seg id="6">The conveyor system in swimming-sport is bad, the doping controls, on the other hand, very good.</seg>
<seg id="7">This means that we can not compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look at doping as closely or even operate it.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "I am not saying that here the controls are to be stopped," "" "he continued." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">If he wanted to start a comeback, Deitemet would have to be announced nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).</seg>

<seg id="5">At 21.30 civil officials in the area of the airport Düsseldorf saw a gang that was known to the police officers from past theft.</seg>
<seg id="6">The two women and two men had committed several crimes since the middle of July and were communal, editary and especially professional.</seg>
<seg id="7">The specialists of the criminal department 34 can demonstrate the thieves which have specifically entered into Germany to enter crimes, to prove four acts.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a few lines of lime trees, meanwhile a rest of cobblestone streets: the Rīga Street in Berlin-Friedrichshain doesn't look like the first sight, but the police count them to the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">When one goes along the road from east to west, one passes playgrounds, a newly painted kindergarten and a bioladen.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "on the façade of a gray house someone has" "" "ugly!" "" "sprayed." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite of a Lidl that will soon be demolished, a house with high windows and 133 new rentals will be built here until 2017.</seg>
<seg id="5">Article on this "trendy district," as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, will be illustrated in recent weeks, however, with burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rented contracts, but on the ground floor there are still spaces occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "since the beginning of the year, particularly the Berlin Insenator Henkel had called for a hard action by the police against the project, called the area as a" "" "no-go zone" "" "for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">After having cleared the rooms on the ground floor, the cadadsmiths, with 300 police officers, the police patrols three weeks according to official statements, with 30 to 40 officials and three teams on site, locked parts of the street and stopping visitors from entering the house with number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the meantime, the building workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the clearance was illegal, and a day later the police and construction workers moved away from sympathisers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun, others are talking about spättis.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the building projects are a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who plays three children here, are mainly generalised by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the Hautes, they share the concern of rising tenets and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a neighborhood, who wished for a majority of police protection from the scandalous left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin intersenator and the police between household occupants and their neighbors make up, obviously does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class neighborhood, which even today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and high poverty risk.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost all the Mainzer Street close to Riga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was evacuated under a regular road, many of the projects were legalized in the Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, in recent years, the district has become increasingly popular for tourists and electors from all over the world: with them residents of GDR times and former homeless friends are sharing their neighbourhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also reflected in the rents which have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in Riga are attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them on the discarded discs or freshly painted facades that have been discarded with color bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other road was mentioned this year so often together with the words" "" "left-autonome violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason for not all neighbors to consider this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes like bodily injury are almost exclusively directed against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The largest part of the offences make property damage which tends to make the newly built and newly renovated houses tend to be.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rented house for 17 years next to the controversial 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violence, it is weightful: the people in the 94 are their neighbors who are not destined to be.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars are no longer available in Riga.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the architect, its road is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "here one helps one another, lives together on the road and gets more of each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has consciously moved to Riga's street - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was also so important that local residents get their streets back: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all of sudden claimed the sense of interpretation across the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of the inhabitants like Neugebauer the road continues to be taken away from them: through unconventional newbuildings in former buildings that displace the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are ultimately condominiums which are not interesting for many here - there are rather people who are not so well cheeky," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "violence and destruction I can absolutely not approve." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do if someone never listens to it?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, also with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for trailers that annoy themselves about colour bombs: the Hautes and the left-hand scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who draw, should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a pub area, can badly complain about noise there.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons named with pre-names have asked to not be called by their right name</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee officer</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle has been the refugee representative for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the management team by Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as contact person for all actors: refugees, working groups, refugees, administration, authorities and anyone else.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than thankful that Deuschle is now there, the zealous wool-milchsau, which has a problem above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">So some - less spotting rather than on the multitude of fulfilling tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">We are looking for an administrative specialist with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just a zealous Wollmilchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organising, working with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for approximately six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent place on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine customer, that Annika Deuschle supports up-to-date and full-time actors." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers soon standing in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection service.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "they have to put the refugees in their own or hired habitats." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility is transferred from the Landratsamt to Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his home.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it does not work so far as one depends on private dwellings, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, rural apartments have to be notorious as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">New containers will soon be placed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine client and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent lead, there are internships, apprenticeships, school places, one-euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants that need to be grounded or established.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine client.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house masters, do charitable work - and that motivates and very neat, such as Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external action.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no employment therapy" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a feeling of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I need offers such as sports, contacts with local people and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also here administration and volunteers are running.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees have the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They have to explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge the time meaningfully, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who develop the feeling someday, he couldn't help in Urbach, should not work and be useless, he will never be able to integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">The work of Deuschle and the customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "mammoth task." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: did the two of the most recent happenings fear radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "said Regine client quite clearly," "" "what some naive call" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the attacks bring them completely in obituary.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "says Regine customer." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "so the main and volunteers" "" "must look for activities on the spot and in the region." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that soon a new push of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, politics is afraid.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to put them on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we have not arrived yet where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also clearly shows that the Urbacher is already busy to integrate the existing people sensibly.</seg>
<seg id="63">Currently, there are about 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "but if people are in need, they need to help them, both women agree." ""</seg>
