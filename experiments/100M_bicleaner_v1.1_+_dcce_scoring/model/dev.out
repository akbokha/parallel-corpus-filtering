Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing action in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the meeting , it should also go about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington is cri@@ tici@@ zing the continuing settlement of Israel and raises Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
through the deal promoted by Obama around Iran &apos;s nuclear program , the relationship between the two has deteri@@ or@@ ated .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu raised a controversi@@ al speech at the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans before the United States Congress , which was partially considered an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with regard to the election of Israel being forth@@ coming .
in an emergency call Professor to have shot his girl@@ friend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told a little z@@ itt@@ y voice of the police that he shot his girl@@ friend and that the officials had to come to his house .
Lamb was important to emphas@@ ise that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was yet alive and probably excited , and he said that the family @-@ file of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house the officials found the cor@@ p@@ ses of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was bent on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I could reverse it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , already taught 300 miles to the school grounds where he had shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ sh@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff members have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb has made the fatal call some@@ time afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took the life when the police enc@@ ir@@ cl@@ ed him .
a day after shooting in the university , the students and lec@@ turers were forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his teaching .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ sh died , said he had no history of violence or criminal record .
Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty comprises 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time , there were some incl@@ inations for problem@@ atic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , the Lamb praised , said , he also seemed a little excited and nervous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if something is wrong with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University to have a complaint for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
the latest changes in the employment policy of the university meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard for him would not guarantee an automatic way to an appointment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Univers@@ itäts @-@ Präsident William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after the escape from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs Spur at the later time when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still in the dri@@ v@@ eway .
it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said she believed that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb began his work at the university in 2009 , with 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12,@@ 000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he did his doc@@ torate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the long@@ time girl@@ friends lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , char@@ ism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met with friends .
she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her guitar playing .
he was the women &apos;s flock at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all girls were melting away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ air@@ ston said , now 40 and live in the Jackson Vor@@ stadt of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss obviously had some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no document of marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house , adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb hit Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail played both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nur@@ se who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ keeper and sometimes entertainment coordin@@ ator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak illuminated bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ sh Night in the night 5 September for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and mouth accordion finished in front of a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the edge of the house and were jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of jo@@ ke .
Schmidt , the dead professor , conducted the first semester seminar program and specialised in American n@@ atives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitch@@ ell , a English professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the Student Committee .
on Tuesday evening , about 900 people took part at the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight memorial service .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts Frau Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the M@@ ahn@@ w@@ ache , while the Univers@@ it@@ ch@@ or &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be res@@ umed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said LA@@ FOR@@ GE . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associ@@ ated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to reflect that the police said that Lamb did the call after having shot Schmidt , and that Lamb described Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas time
toys R Us says that there will not be so many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby product dealer says that he will give the currently employed staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said that it was planned to stop 4@@ 0,000 people in stores and distribution centres across the country . in the Christmas season 2014 , 45@@ .000 workers were hired .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said that this month it will start with interviews and increases the number of employees from October to December .
while the holidays are still a few months away , the Christmas business moves closer , and companies are preparing to hire temporary staff to equi@@ p shops with employees that sell , ship and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the ro@@ y@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for a forth@@ coming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film starts and it comes to mind that I am a simul@@ ated man@@ e and an arc length away from being on a date with the Princess of Wales .
back in Time , a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; pre@@ mier@@ ed 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ disp@@ uted the greatest time @-@ trip film ever shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October .
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ Moon said his response to Russia &apos;s enhanced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will only exac@@ erb@@ ate violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people .
the UN leader once again calls upon all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support integr@@ ative negotiations on finding a political solution .
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the br@@ ink of meeting the General Assembly meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ ts that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ sol@@ vable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 survey values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand it as flo@@ p .
others have done it as a jo@@ ke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Rep@@ ublic@@ ans attempt to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks in case of surveys , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showing Donald Tr@@ ump in double dig@@ its , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at this time in 2011 Rick P@@ err@@ ys guided tour to the rising Her@@ man C@@ ain , none of whom also won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but outside groups such as J@@ eb B@@ ush@@ s Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Tr@@ umps stamina and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow it .
here are some current survey values that suggest that real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
he@@ eling popularity has turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candi@@ dat@@ ure in mid @-@ June , a survey by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positively .
by mid @-@ July there were 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
now , six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in the early States .
a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good view of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of GO@@ P vot@@ ers would be happy with b@@ ump as candidates .
in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 per cent say they are &quot; thr@@ illed &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next in matters of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can vot@@ ers say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans does not see the tem@@ per &apos;s temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely cri@@ tici@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of Irish vot@@ ers tend to believe that real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the first state of state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans think he has the personality for a supreme commander , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
yet 44 percent think he did not have the personality to effectively perform his office , and almost six of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament is not p@@ asse , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can vot@@ ers get used to the idea .
if they raise their guns , republi@@ can vot@@ ers hold Tr@@ ump for real .
if they are asked who is most likely the GO@@ P nomin@@ ee wins , after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change from the time when four out of ten put their money on J@@ eb Bush from the end of July .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P vot@@ ers did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans claimed that Rick P@@ erry would win nom@@ ination vs only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a variety of GO@@ P vot@@ ers will see Tr@@ umps campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump strikes almost everybody .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Tr@@ umps management while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is diff@@ used to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey of Mon@@ mouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump will re@@ ap the majority of support .
he ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally ahead of Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate that strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ at @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans says that they have formed their mind .
a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of vot@@ ers who support Tr@@ ump say they have firmly assigned their votes .
of course , a lot can happen to change that , and nobody can really say never change the opinion .
46 percent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
nonetheless , Tr@@ umps is the strongest competi@@ tor at the moment the other out@@ sider , the neuro@@ sur@@ geon Ben Car@@ son , but vot@@ ers who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for Tr@@ ump .
six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign launched two months ago immigrants from Mexico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the immigration and fishing point in public discourse was in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are worried that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump will hold significant He@@ z@@ p@@ ano Americans from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the re @-@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post survey of Monday 6 out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump in questions of immigration .
so long as immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ ight , Donald Tr@@ ump will apparently do it .
the fru@@ stration on the government climb@@ s to new high@@ s .
meanwhile , on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , about half of the support of republi@@ can vot@@ ers , especially by their out@@ sider status .
six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new Monday survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience .
and they are also angry with Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register , Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa , two weeks ago , shows that three of four I@@ owa Rep@@ ublic@@ ans are fru@@ str@@ ated with 54 percent &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; fern@@ ally off@@ ended . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
here in the Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea area .
in the street a square meter of a roof house costs 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which particular layers a square meter costs most .
of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euros nothing - per square meter , well @-@ marked .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here .
Champions League : Bavaria @-@ Traum@@ start dank Müller und Gö@@ tze
double Tor@@ sch@@ ütze in Pira@@ eus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for the FC Bayern to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pira@@ eus - then it ran .
a supreme pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Gö@@ tze created a dream start to the FC Bayern in the Wit@@ ch@@ essel of Pira@@ eus .
the team of trainers P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their spectac@@ le match in the Champions League at the Greek record champion of Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Gö@@ tz@@ es Treffer ( 89 . ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth start @-@ up in series should be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
Müller received ben@@ ign help from Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto at his 28th Hit in the Champions League for the Bavaria leadership , who caused a gun@@ shot of the world master to be thought as flan@@ k .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria captain Philipp Lah@@ m promised hot @-@ blo@@ o@@ ded fans before the game in the Kar@@ ay@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium - and the Münchner beha@@ ved word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea without shining .
Pira@@ eus had won his youngest home games in the royal class , including famous clubs like Manchester United , At@@ lé@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund was also proud ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria , defeated in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , didn &apos;t want to be the next victim .
they went cour@@ age@@ ously , but in their aggressive efforts , however , often to be imagin@@ ative .
the attacks were often initiated by rel@@ ocation to the left outside of Douglas Costa , which was rarely en@@ forced against former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck on the right when his flan@@ k dropped from the right half @-@ field in the left upper tor@@ so .
in the 6@@ 7. minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , when Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown hit the Polish head ball ( 26 ) .
then by direct @-@ off , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto was par@@ aded with the knee ( 35@@ th ) .
although the Bav@@ arians moved to their usual dominant game , Pir@@ äus was able to set needle stit@@ ches .
but on door@@ ke@@ epers Manuel Neu@@ er was lost .
so about when he pul@@ ls a shot from Ide@@ ye about the lat@@ te ( 51 . ) .
before Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola ordered a fort@@ night with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it good .
Mario Gö@@ tze , back to mus@@ cular problems back in the cad@@ re , was sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero was given green light only after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said at &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to make something different from it is already evil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also during the first altern@@ ation , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sle@@ y Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59 . ) .
Gö@@ tze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made everything clear about 13 minutes later , Müller still sat down on it .
in front of the game it was in the stadium to Kra@@ v@@ allen .
after a smaller group of partly m@@ um@@ bled Bavaria fans in their spec@@ t@@ ator blo@@ c obviously prov@@ oked the supporters of hosts Pira@@ eus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went against the Münchner supporters .
at least one Bayern fan was injured out of the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
the good news : in case of zi@@ cht , the risk decreases rapidly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers lay the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely , in order to increase the 2,5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold .
the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
main causes of tooth loss be ca@@ vi@@ ties and inflammation of the g@@ um , empha@@ sizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these peri@@ od@@ on@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , empha@@ size the authors .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth is therefore reduced to more frequent g@@ um infections in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of c@@ aries .
people who quit smoking might reduce their risk within a short period of time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ing again sin@@ ks back to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , explained first author Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one must convince people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , head of study H@@ einer Bo@@ eing from the DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking dimin@@ ishes life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
smoking is good for lungs and vessels , and according to our findings also leads to good dental health down to the high age .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population at the age of 65 to 74 years of dental imp@@ unity was affected , the DI@@ f@@ E shared .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study supports the findings .
archae@@ ologists come across the Cologne branch of Cologne on the remn@@ ants of the late anti@@ ke
for the repeated time , archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne .
in the vicinity of the building site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum skel@@ et@@ ons and remn@@ ants of historical buildings excav@@ ated , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine , histori@@ ans are searching for so @-@ called soil monuments .
in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne the museum is always drawn up as a department of archae@@ ology for archaeological sites .
the ar@@ che@@ ologists were found in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ards .
from text documents it has already been known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century have stood a church , explained Trier .
besides the remains of the fortress and the church tower a cemetery with around 350 gra@@ ves was discovered , which probably belonged to the church .

EU Commission proposes new judgment in dispute over T@@ TIP
the EU Commission proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system to def@@ use the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Free Trade Agreement ( T@@ TIP ) .
the controversi@@ al private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its function clearly corresponds to more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in charge of the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de proposes to introduce the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
T@@ TIP is said to be the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans to reform current arbit@@ ration cases con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come to the same parts from the EU , the USA and third countries .
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to appeal against verdi@@ cts .
so far the proceedings took place among themselves on arbit@@ rat@@ ors ; there was no obj@@ ection to their verdi@@ ct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past few months , it became clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , comm@@ enting on Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it wants to work towards an international investment court according to its own specifications .
there , for example , there could be disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) demanded above all by large corporations are considered to be one of the main reasons for the major resistance in Europe against T@@ TIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are cri@@ tici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel judicial system , which companies claim damages to tax@@ pay@@ ers , le@@ verage national laws , or reduce the reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first comments , anti @-@ T@@ TIP organisations like Camp@@ act have considered the European Commission &apos;s proposals as in@@ adequate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cri@@ tici@@ zed above all that they should not be considered for the negoti@@ ated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German economic state Secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a great advance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission considered essential points to reform the reform of the Federal Minister of Economics of Sig@@ mar Gabriel in spring with other EU Trade Ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration is from the table .
the French government also welcomed Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
the European company BUS@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against limiting the economy of the economy by too many new rules .
particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged by that .
when the talks on the Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) trade agreement can be concluded , it remains un@@ clear on Wednesday .
the negotiations began in mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is regarded as un@@ sustainable .
del@@ ik@@ ater Folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , which the shy acting folk singer has recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost captiv@@ ated by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells us about different places he records on the map again and again about his min@@ u@@ ci@@ ously arranged songs .
where they were born and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has been a wonderfully creative person .
with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; sound compos@@ ing songs seem to be very close to American folk in the late six@@ ties , but can always drift into great op@@ ul@@ ents at any time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the rum@@ or , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michigan &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; would be the first part of a moving series : each of the 50 US states should be followed in a row . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and in Rhein@@ sberg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already appeared and has positive expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;

a year later , the musician living in New York is back to the series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The incense &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) a nation@@ wide celebrated master@@ piece is published in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
finishing in ideas and styli@@ stic refin@@ ement .
the album climb@@ s up to the US Bill@@ board Charts and is missing in any yearly list of the influ@@ ential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after extremely productive experiments St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of AD@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic fail@@ ures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth decent studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and re@@ verb .
long ago the smaller clubs were disp@@ at@@ ched , the stage shows become a colourful spectac@@ le of Ne@@ on brow@@ band and large fluor@@ escent stage decoration .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring as part of a five member band through Germany .

&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Lo@@ well &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although nearly 2,000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the clearly adverti@@ sed St@@ ev@@ ens returns to intim@@ acy and folk .
without direc@@ ting a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
from the audience one h@@ ears : the talk is &quot; op@@ ul@@ ent , &quot; and one can therefore throw away the &quot; plate . &quot;
in addition to an enc@@ ore , St@@ ev@@ ens feels humble , acousti@@ cally plays a few older songs and finally bows down to ro@@ aring appl@@ ause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut at the prime minister &apos;s question@@ er
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut in the prime minister &apos;s question@@ ings is expected with sus@@ pen@@ se .
the new Labour MEP Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is said to be his debut at the prime minister &apos;s question@@ er and for the first time to invest with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask for the first of his six given questions shortly after noon , whereby his performance is likely to be checked by the media and the Labour MPs from nearby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he called for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less theater and more facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this weekly event . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also said he could ski@@ p some sessions to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s leadership because it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour Group &apos;s decision to ins@@ ist on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration of the 75@@ th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , critic@@ ises a number of T@@ ory MPs and stands at the center of several front pages stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a spokes@@ man of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had been &quot; in resp@@ ect@@ ful silence &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ atten@@ u@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two news night program that he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the mon@@ archy should be aboli@@ shed .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they were referring to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ li@@ ament@@ ary party supported him as a leader .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; st@@ acked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within Labour , according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s remarks on the position of the European Union and the limitation on winn@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C Conference that Labour changes in order to remove all the idea of limiting total .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow of work and pension ministers said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to cut £ 26,@@ 000 to 23,@@ 000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron ever since he is T@@ ory CEO over the last decade across the Dis@@ patch Box in the Parliament .
the Labour leader , who has promised a different policy approach , says he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for Mr Cameron &apos;s questions and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s question@@ ings are too slo@@ thful and that he will ref@@ rain from both &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pun@@ ish@@ edness &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the dispute with ad@@ vers@@ aries , and to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic mini@@ stri@@ es , will be represented if he does not participate - for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues may occasionally speak the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the sub @-@ house , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le theatre , &quot; which is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s question@@ ings . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was first sent on television in 1990 , the question@@ ings with the prime minister were considered the most important barometer of the ruling of a leader and his leadership in the shelter and his position among his Par@@ li@@ ament@@ ary colleagues , although critics have argu@@ ed that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require far @-@ reaching reforms .

pound increases by acceler@@ ating wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound rose sharp@@ ly according to data , which show an increase in the UK &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was raised by SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9 % compared with the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest and has been estimated at the time of an auction .
the pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 505 and was climb@@ ed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index concluded with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29.@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a 20 % jump after the acquisition of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v received .
one transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
bur@@ berry @-@ shares were 0.9 % higher following encouraging news from the competition @-@ based competition for luxury goods .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for bur@@ berry - again reports growth .
Gl@@ enc@@ ore shares rose 5 % after the mining giant said that it took 2.5 billion $ by stock sales as part of its debt reduction strategy .
the shares of the packaging and paper group Mon@@ di were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a decrease of 4.3 % , after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his assessment of rating for the company rating .
JD Sports rose by 3,@@ 1 % after the Sport Cancer Company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 46.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
the head of JD Sports says that higher wages thre@@ aten expansion .
the CEO of JD Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compens@@ ate the higher labour costs at his company , he says .
the costs could meet the expansion plans of JD Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .

PE@@ GI@@ DA poster brings Leb@@ anese on m@@ ashed potatoes
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
both - and indeed in the Kartoffel@@ d@@ ön@@ er , which the Oldenburg Imb@@ iss owner Han@@ i Al@@ h@@ ay has developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Peg@@ i@@ da movement , Al@@ h@@ ay has put potato and meat together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Peg@@ i@@ da demonstration with the in@@ scription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potatoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he acci@@ dentally had seen on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , a barbecue sk@@ ewer is in its store , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ h@@ ay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea has meanwhile registered the Leb@@ anese at the Patent Office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as utility model .
that is why Al@@ h@@ ay does not want to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes are in the sk@@ ewer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the culinary del@@ ights of the international understanding also come along with its customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; met@@ ropolis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; starts till@@ age campaign to combat Al@@ di@@ - &quot; &quot; &quot;
Met@@ ropolis is trying to protect the I@@ GA branch in front of an Al@@ di @-@ rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food whol@@ es@@ aler Met@@ ropolis has launched a Boden@@ stan@@ ger@@ min@@ ts campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA super@@ markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand I@@ GA through mainstream marketing and marketing across the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ aide Show .
I@@ GA dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as S@@ immo from Dun@@ s@@ bor@@ ough , distributed in I@@ GA stores and shop owners who sell cheaper tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish more details of his defence strategy on September 29 when the whol@@ es@@ aler for food , alcohol and devices under@@ goes its annual investor strategy day .
it &apos;s much in the game , as South Australia and Western Australia accounts for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit mar@@ gins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe Al@@ di will take about five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after the opening of its first markets and will take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath by Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and met@@ a 250 million $ by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in every market .
the loss in food and food business and with the quantities on met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost around 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time , Met@@ cash is losing market shares in the eastern states , mainly in Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan has found out that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that met@@ c@@ ash@@ s will fall in the food and food business by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told Melbourne that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade .
met@@ a refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash received contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
ig@@ as &apos;s market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which has around 1.@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , which reflects operating debt reduction at the same time pressure on sales and mar@@ gins .
however , the whol@@ es@@ aler def@@ ends itself and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars in order to increase sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths by hundreds of products every week and to improve their stores with fast growing fresh food and deliver a better choice of private label foods .
met@@ c@@ ash@@ s chief executive Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging renovation programs will be set to Elan and hopes that the whol@@ es@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in 2017 for the first time in 2017 .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves more praise than criticism for his behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ z and deserves praise from the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly as a cri@@ tique of his own behaviour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is repeatedly called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Special Ks &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; came into the li@@ mel@@ ight with St@@ an W@@ aw@@ rin@@ ka with St@@ an W@@ aw@@ rin@@ ka at the Montreal Masters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a fier@@ y qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the arbit@@ rat@@ ors , with Har@@ rison excl@@ aimed : &quot; V@@ aw@@ rin@@ ka would have had to beat C@@ yrene , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis r@@ ack@@ et after a cr@@ amp cam@@ oufl@@ aged a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was def@@ ended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glas@@ gow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth in the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ fin@@ als against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing about which I am quite busy is the fact that after my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn a little into the argument , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a r@@ ack@@ et when he lost in the US Open because of a cr@@ amp , but he is not the first player who broke a r@@ ack@@ et of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know he is not proud of it .
but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too severely .
he is a very gri@@ pper 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he has never had a problem with the other players , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly did not support the decision to consider Kyr@@ gy@@ us at the important preliminary decision , which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term permanent part to return to the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all around the Kont@@ ro@@ ver@@ sen around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Nick was very quickly made up of what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he climb@@ s up in the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the critic@@ isms he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary explains the emergency and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to illeg@@ ally return to the country . everything with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border , as hundreds of migrants joined in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Ser@@ b officials with indi@@ gn@@ ation .
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but fru@@ str@@ ations rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicop@@ ter wo@@ ke over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried out ins@@ ults against the Hungarian police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were returned from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back while more and more arriving from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming days , discussions with Brussels and other countries must take place , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border arrived a day after the 28 @-@ nation blo@@ c at a controversi@@ al meeting in Brussels that no common immigration policy could be agreed .
however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people who were seeking refuge in the crowded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the next month or by the end of the year , an agreement would be concluded that the EU states would take another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria asked for a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however Hungary did not put his hopes on a soon @-@ term action from Brussels or his neigh@@ bors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the emergency room , rested on Tuesday in two southern regions , gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could ban streets and accelerate asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after having finished a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie d &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison streets were used during the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and an entry point into the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most approaching economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU countries , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws that came into force around midnight are crossing the border or dam@@ aging the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 feet ) high fence that the government built along the southern border to Serbia , a crime . these laws also lay higher sentences for convic@@ ted traff@@ ick@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation resulting from mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said government spokes@@ person Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs rep@@ or@@ ters in the southern City of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree to the deployment of the military , which is expected next week but rep@@ or@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen on the border of heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on days for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated into the country .
they come over by dam@@ aging the fence , they are now in police custo@@ dy and are accused of comm@@ itting crimes according to the new laws .
authorities are in the process of quickly repair the fence .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia after a train wagon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders had arrived .
chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and press a crowd to push themselves there .
about 20 managed to get there , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main highway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins over to the ground .
Clinton has now supported 47 percent of democratic vot@@ ers in pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent earlier ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent increase ( 17 percent rise ) .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is candidates for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic vot@@ ers in the pre @-@ election .
more than five months before the first elections , most democratic vot@@ ers say it is too early to say that their opinion is determining which candidates will support them .
but Clin@@ tons supporters are more resistant in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News survey Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders earned some profits .
Clinton holds a big lead in women and moder@@ ates , but these j@@ umps have dimin@@ ished .
your support with the men has dropped sharp@@ ly , and S@@ anders simply res@@ ides here with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage with democratic vot@@ ers under the age of 50 has fled , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
Clinton , however , has a major advantage with the older vot@@ ers .
last month , Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic elec@@ tors of the primar@@ ies nation@@ wide say they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the Party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and further 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
maybe not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are enthusiastic especially of her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the views are more mixed with those who are not currently supporting Clinton - only about a quarter would love them enthusias@@ tically . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while 48 percent of democratic vot@@ ers say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can vot@@ ers say this about their top candidates Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , is the most common answer that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the notion that it is time that a woman president is ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s support is also mentioned by Clinton &apos;s supporters ( 9 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agreement to deal with the problems and the vot@@ ability are also c@@ ited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the vice @-@ president has a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic elec@@ tors of the pre @-@ presidential elections want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if democratic vot@@ ers are asked for election who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Clin@@ tons supporters , more than half say that their second choice would be far from S@@ anders .
if bi@@ ds decide not to channel the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead is increased from S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; five @-@ five percent of democratic vot@@ ers consider Clinton to be a candidate with the best chances to win the election ; however , this number dropped by 78 percent last month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; sel@@ f@@ able &quot; has risen .
nevertheless , with the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democr@@ at vot@@ ers call questions about vot@@ ers .
similar to the last month , no single democratic candidate or a potential candidate for those elec@@ tors of the pre @-@ election is considered un@@ acceptable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the democr@@ acies of candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important characteristics of vot@@ ers in the elections of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
in the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best cut off with hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of the democratic vot@@ ers do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no view of it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democratic vot@@ ers in the primar@@ ies generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in all these measurements , about a quarter of democratic vot@@ ers did not think of S@@ anders .
since questions about Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as foreign minister , most Democratic vot@@ ers are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions overall .
but it is a different story in the American public altogether .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the email contro@@ vers@@ y had no effect on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion had deteri@@ or@@ ated .
it is mainly Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that Clinton &apos;s views have become worse .
although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the vot@@ ers of their party , this is still a problem for them among registered vot@@ ers : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 62 percent of vot@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , 55 percent of vot@@ ers nation@@ wide see Tr@@ ump as not honest and not trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good grades in leadership .
from the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut off with hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic vot@@ ers in the elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves closer to Donald Tr@@ ump in country @-@ wide survey
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times close to Donald Tr@@ ump
in the meantime , half of the vot@@ ers &apos; support in the new survey is decl@@ ining , and others are losing dramatic support .
Republi@@ can vot@@ ers continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers throughout the country . the support is growing 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month by 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son oss in the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son was well received by demographic groups and sur@@ passed Tr@@ ump under Republi@@ can vot@@ ers with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten with Wis@@ con@@ sins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who is most pleased with 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Florida governor J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are on the third place with 6 % .
the error margin in the sample of 376 people of Republi@@ can vot@@ ers in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son rises in the surveys - he lands at 19 % support from the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump mark@@ edly ahead of Car@@ son .
looking at a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some side hi@@ eves for the former neuro@@ sur@@ geon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ olog@@ ised to question Tr@@ umps &apos;s belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the Eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are only measured in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find even warm water .
a bath in the north or the Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people no longer go into the sea : at a maximum of 18 degrees the water in the North and Baltic Sea in this week , shares the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) .
in contrast , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the East , it even gets up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic , it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood are charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College ne@@ ul@@ ings
almost two years after a student died as a student train@@ ee in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , assass@@ ination was filed against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an intro@@ duc@@ tory ceremony in September 2013 and delayed his transportation to the hospital , which has contributed to his death , the police shared .
officials said he had been loaded with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , and had repeatedly been attacked while trying to approach a given field on a target .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and suppos@@ edly waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so called the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to get rid of his symptoms , and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to seek advice , the police officer Chris Wagner said at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point the members began to hide U@@ ten@@ si@@ lia and in principle set the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood on the basis of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poly@@ z@@ ef Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be resur@@ rec@@ ted , and he died on his injuries next morning .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g was repeatedly attached to the head , trunk and th@@ igh@@ s with a bl@@ unt force .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student died every year in the sham@@ ans , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents the D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation .
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended an indictment for murder of third counts for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also indic@@ ted for lack of religious attacks and forming a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to take responsibility for the people involved but if there is an organization that - officially or in@@ official - has sanc@@ tioned this , so we will also attract those people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch College b@@ anned the Brotherhood and the national bro@@ therhood has vo@@ iced its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases the interest
a pitch is coming , and the hou@@ se@@ uses will fall into wa@@ ist , ren@@ ders for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know this .
what we do not know is how long this will last and how long it will stop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance on the course . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when up@@ lifting interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems react .
therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank emphasized so sharp@@ ly that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could find that all the excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated because of a interest increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no effects .
here is a view on historical trends based on how some areas of the economy might react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the increase occurs , the impact is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is apparently a tendency to dimin@@ ish assets from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may again reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said German @-@ Bank analysts in a recent study on what happened after the F@@ ed interest threats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market has been in the past 35 years mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to interest pitch , rather flat in the 250 days afterwards ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal condition after 500 days , with an average yield in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis , the Bob D@@ oll , head of investment strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the raising cycle and the return on investment begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often encourage them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that have not existed before and that could accelerate a recession .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest score at a pla@@ iting elevation of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest increases since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expected only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such a frag@@ ile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raises the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants have made a interest in the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trade is only a chance of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study all the raising cycles from 1950 to this day have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in BI@@ P and before rec@@ essi@@ on@@ sh@@ es very quickly put into the shadow after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far .
the fixed income was also volati@@ le as the market out@@ lines the interest rate , and the pattern is rather similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than with shares if they change their strategic course .
bonds seem to change the direction once the first increase / decrease occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the raising cycle the bond companies immediately fall , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the rise in interest rates will result in rendering returns between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fix@@ ed @-@ In@@ come analysts at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interesting is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jones says that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed @-@ strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the earnings curve is flat , l@@ ending have expanded and volati@@ lity has risen - all the tra@@ its of the market if the F@@ ed is shar@@ pen@@ ing its strategy .
in the large and whole , companies that un@@ wind the greater part of their business in the USA will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multin@@ ational companies with high deb@@ ts will get worse , as an increasing dollar is making their products more expensive on the global market , as well as financing their deb@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to be extremely positive three months after an initial interest increase , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded 5 percentage points on average after each of the interest increases 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
deb@@ ts will be a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest are most likely to lose , said Gold@@ man .
outside of pure equity games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
saver could see gains through higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are how fast this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says MPs Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conservative member of the Parliament cri@@ tici@@ zed the sender for his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ id &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distinguished from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said they im@@ it@@ ated only The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EP colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked the programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Voice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said this is not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Classic FM , says a leading parliamentary member and boo@@ sts new pressure on the sender to prove that he does something that the private transm@@ it@@ ters do not do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conservative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ id &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be The Br@@ its only under a different name .
so , if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC @-@ General Director drew up the alle@@ g@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competi@@ tor when it comes to live music and education .
what I learn from Radio 3 I will not learn from classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and playing music that is really un@@ sur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the engagement of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works , I also consider it important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argu@@ ed that tough@@ er must be working to engage the audience as it did in the past , because the British were less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of the BBC production , which during the hearing in the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sports for it was under fire to hit the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .
the T@@ ory member Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice - the BBC Music talent show bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of € 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced on a special BBC @-@ way .
he added , he wants the company to &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house barn &quot; when the next time there was a series of entertainment .
however , he refused to excl@@ ude the order from other rows of The Voice in the future or to spend money from the fee pay@@ er for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales rose in August at the slow@@ est and the Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest score since the beginning of the records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday has bra@@ ked the issues in November
for over a decade , the virtual shopping has ble@@ w , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
however , experts say that there are now signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure on August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared with the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , this has always developed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ RG sales track to the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this is comm@@ uting , and we will possibly experience that growth will dimin@@ ish .
the Black @-@ Friday @-@ phenomenon imported from America is quoted as a reason for the decre@@ asing turnover .
experts believe that buyers are holding back their purchases before this event , which takes place on the last Friday of November .
last year , five times sli@@ pped the average number of buyers for their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer sites crashed .
experts believe Black Friday , where the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium found that 5 £ spending was spent a little more than £ 1 online .
with some products such as tel@@ ev@@ is@@ ions and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of purchases are now carried out via Web @-@ Shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothing and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca near the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are carried by Muslims during the first bur@@ ial pris@@ ons in Mec@@ ca through the streets
Saudi Arabia evi@@ den@@ ced the collapse of partially the huge Saudi @-@ bin Laden group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured after the crane crashed .
hundreds of Muslims gathered , when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those killed when a crane crashed on Mek@@ ka &apos;s Grand mo@@ sch@@ ee .
mour@@ ners filled , largely dressed in white , the way to sh@@ ol@@ len their respect when the first of the dead came their last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ ais@@ s@@ em C@@ emetery .
the mour@@ ning proc@@ ession passed on to the sacred site , where only days ago a building crane over@@ threw the mos@@ que and then fell on the bed@@ side .
the bodies were approved for the fun@@ eral , when the Saudi @-@ king informed about the construction company of the Bin Laden , due to the cat@@ astrophe , which also left 394 injured , a san@@ ction .
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 praying , who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Bank of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Gre@@ ater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage to stress .
Mr Ak@@ ram was in the Grand Mos@@ que with his parents before the start of the yearly H@@ add@@ sch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to Mek@@ ka with thousands who continue to come to the city . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today king Sal@@ man said , the Bin Laden group would not have allowed the arm of the crane to be stopped when he was not used .
an Arabic version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ speaking Service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said the company &apos;s conduct abroad was prohibited .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the overthrow of the crane , which crashed into a courtyard of the Grand mo@@ sch@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which later took place this month , gathered .
the Bin Laden group did not publish any statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also imp@@ eded the group because of not current security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s Grand mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project headed by the bin Laden group .
the Bin Laden &apos;s family has been associated with the royal family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over larger projects .
the de@@ ceased leader of Al Qa@@ eda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &apos;s .
the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , just a few days before arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the Pil@@ gri@@ mage , which is necessary at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials said that 158 people stay in the hospital .
government officials admitted that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) are to be paid to relatives of the killed and the same amount to permanently injured .
other injured receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European arti@@ sans is over
British employ increasingly tra@@ des@@ people , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ people from Eastern Europe has sur@@ ged behind
this means that 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix stores aimed at tra@@ des@@ people will be opened .
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her will close 60 B &amp; Q outlets nation@@ wide
by Rupert St@@ einer , City Chef @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent of Daily Mail
it is said that British are laying their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European arti@@ sans who carry out work in their home
if you are sk@@ ill@@ fully dealing with a hammer or a brush for painting walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays .
because British employ increasingly tra@@ des@@ people to perform DIY jobs in their houses , the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new managing director of King@@ fis@@ her who owns the DIY chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe that offer services at low prices is now over@@ hau@@ led .
King@@ fis@@ her is therefore planning to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which turn to professional tra@@ des@@ men and close 60 outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten buying decisions in the shop are met by women .
at the moment , the men out@@ weigh the men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said it is necessary to face growing demographic trends that have more feminine single households than in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to shift this to a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions about the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also ob@@ struct their top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ fis@@ her is almost the only company that has occupied just 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and finance .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ fis@@ her reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and turnover after the Group deb@@ ated the costs of closing the stores .
because of the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new stores .
function@@ aries by A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday , at the Landes@@ gericht Kl@@ agen@@ furt , two officials of the Austrian Vol@@ leyball Vi@@ z@@ eme A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to answer for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and departure .
the def@@ endants ple@@ aded not guilty .
one of them was also charged with the abuse of ministers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from this accus@@ ation he has been legally released in May . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current process has been post@@ pon@@ ed .
according to the rule of law , Robert Ri@@ ffel was out of the preliminary investigation that the def@@ endants in the years 2006 to 2011 were sum@@ mon@@ ing funds from club accounts that were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions , for private purposes .
the damage inf@@ licted with around 400@@ ,000 euros .
sports function@@ aries are also charged with financial fail@@ ures .
this fact was eliminated by the Chairman of the White Op@@ ener , Jud@@ ge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negoti@@ ated at a later date .
in order to dis@@ regard the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defense claimed that the association was not at any time an asset .
the sports function@@ aries would only have charged expenses and the sports club for which they had spent a lot of time and money in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the Passi@@ va amounted to about 600@@ .000 Sch@@ illing ( approx . 44@@ .000 Euro ) in 2001 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then we were standing before the situation : do we carry the club further or lock ourselves ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; one of the def@@ endants , in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bread@@ winner &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; told one of the chief executives of the financial office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his colleagues and co @-@ accused , he decided to take this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , put our life insur@@ ances as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the bill . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association agreed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can manage the money freely , no deb@@ ts can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , with corresponding financial - success , the expenditure of expenses compens@@ ated by 1991 was decided retro@@ spec@@ tively until 1991 .
therefore you have paid a part of the expenses only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus was on the account , paid off .
therefore , l@@ ump and not detail accounting seemed to be explained , the former Ob@@ mann explained the processes .
the accounts and as@@ parag@@ us ad@@ ministered together the two def@@ endants , said the second def@@ endant .
why the withdraw@@ als were not disclosed in detail in detail , the judge asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association was not interested in the details of financial security , but it was only important to have the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the club account against the one function@@ arian investigations .
these were rep@@ ublic@@ s , declar@@ ing the def@@ endants .
this securities account was on the name of the second def@@ endant and was not known to the association according to its statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on top of that , the respon@@ dent did not know an answer for a long time .
then he finally said he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor asked in the room .
the accused had been informed , the function@@ arian justified himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compensation in@@ dem@@ nity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why claim compensation ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
the first def@@ endant explained that he did not agree with this wording because the association never had any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with him you are all out of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a lawyer ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
further said the official , he never referred a c@@ ents sal@@ ary , he only calcul@@ ates o@@ dom@@ eter money and di@@ ets .
in di@@ ets he charged the club 1,000 euros per month , but the actual expenditure was much higher , he added .
the accused did not have precise documents for the early years .
they were not kept anymore after an audit in which everything was judged as correct , they declared .
kilomet@@ re money also referred to the second def@@ endant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all Beh@@ aves shall be in cash , in order to do so from his hom@@ etown of international market to the Bank to Blei@@ burg , he declared in his statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main hearing continued on 23 September with the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard goes another 30,000 jobs
in addition to staff re@@ ductions that have been ongoing for three years , the computer giant will be able to aboli@@ sh additional jobs in the company &apos;s division .
the Stell@@ enst@@ ran@@ ungen in the US computer giant Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not find an end .
within the framework of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the breakdown of 25,@@ 000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customers .
as a result , costs of $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special burden of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will fall from the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 55@@ .000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years .
at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP had some 30@@ 2,000 employees .
Hewlett @-@ Packard &apos;s share gave up 2.3 percent .
the corporation with printers from the California State Pal@@ o Alto currently spl@@ its up : this is how the computer and printer business is to be bund@@ led in a new society - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data store for companies and other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
another dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services put the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo Th@@ ink@@ ly .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just about 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
the proceeds went back in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP answers the changes in the industry with a split and massive stag@@ gering .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has re@@ acted to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and getting more shops straight away online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plan shows a total of around 55@@ .000 jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
conflicts : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
but a direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq , however , would mainly reject rejection : 54 percent spoke against it , 35 percent appeared to agree .
the fact that other states fly air strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria find 61 percent positive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , 24 percent are opposed to interv@@ ene in the conflict . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a cooperation with the Syrian authorities of Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad declined 51 percent of the respon@@ dents , 20 percent would be for this .
29 per cent were not able to decide .
car : second day on the 6@@ 6. I@@ AA
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the focus of the trade fair will be at the heart of the fair by 27 September , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars and electric mobility . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mobility connects &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wide audience can visit the I@@ AA from Saturday .
the organis@@ ers of the V@@ DA car association count as two years ago with about 900 000 visitors .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : non@@ violence on Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police used refugees at the Ser@@ b border in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ gn@@ as and water@@ lights against several hundred shel@@ tered refugees .
Eur@@ on@@ ews @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the breach of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees perme@@ ated the border .
behind it a police line formed and behind the polic@@ emen there was a water@@ front ready .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles according to officials .
the officials initially set an un@@ interrupted pep@@ per@@ spray .
then the police used Tr@@ än@@ gn@@ as .
much tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now with@@ drawn a little bit .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was taken away from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees chi@@ pped together and suffered under breath .
the spokes@@ men of the Ser@@ b police also suffered injuries by using tear gas and pep@@ per@@ spray .
time deciding on interest rates for the U.S. staff
the world is watching when the U.S. bank@@ note comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , in order to make the important decision whether interest has been raised for the first time for almost a decade or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists survey@@ ed by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this now , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain somewhat longer and interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent will hold .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest was on N@@ ULL .
&quot; for the first time we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Head of Staff at the Peters@@ on Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tril@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less cru@@ de outlook on global relations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs point out that the odds against such a step are good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision is to be announced at 08 : 00 CET on Thursday
Todes@@ sch@@ ütze an der Delta State University
after fir@@ ing and killing his girl@@ friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot his colleagues on the day and killed - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and , &quot; he couldn &apos;t make it happen , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lec@@ turer for ge@@ ography and social science education at Delta State University , called emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He had shot on someone and killed anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb told the staff of the emergency centre that the police must send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoyed my wife yesterday evening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be up@@ set . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller after his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 who said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could reverse it .
I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb 300 miles flown to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen enc@@ amped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Univers@@ itäts @-@ Präsident William LA@@ FOR@@ GE said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite reports on Monday that Lamb suppos@@ edly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ sh had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who stated that they were married for about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ sh would have a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said Pr@@ enti@@ s were her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was working online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day K@@ now@@ les identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
K@@ now@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog called Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said K@@ now@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ph@@ oned relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is not going to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a polic@@ eman put him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled on foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
in the spring of 2015 , Lamb was awarded a doctoral degree from Delta State University as his way of life on the University &apos;s website .

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa is building the Group
the Lufthansa is planning a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization .
in 150 of the more than 1,000 executives around the world , the Group restructuring will cost the workplace .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the pilot union , there is no new negoti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the approval of Euro@@ wings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment is to generate an earnings contribution of some 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue syn@@ ergi@@ es , distributed the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , there will be no management board in the future for the passenger &apos;s business in the future .
the Euro@@ wings low @-@ cost airline should be developed as independently as possible .
in the future , head of management Carsten Sp@@ oh@@ r will be responsible for Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt for Euro@@ wings .
with the new creation , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group intends to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
up to now , the organisation of the 120 000 employees was complex .
the airlines operate under the umbrella of the Passage Airline Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of € 30 billion .
new negotiations with the pil@@ ots
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the collective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tari@@ ff Con@@ fli@@ ct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the cock@@ pit ( VC ) the negotiations are to be res@@ umed on this Thursday after the dispute . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that shared the union .
the topic of talks shall be the retirement provisions for pil@@ ots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a forec@@ asted record result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cock@@ pit wool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wants to achieve results as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between union and airline has led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the transi@@ tional provision of the pil@@ ots , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concept is used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it stipul@@ ates that Lufthansa is in the fight against competitors routes to the Group &apos;s own budget Euro@@ wings .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United is not able to play for months due to double fac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at the PSV Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
while this led to the left outside def@@ ender to cry and excl@@ ude it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by Hé@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year old Sha@@ w was forced into the PSV area .
he was treated nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before being hospit@@ alized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg action and is located in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be rel@@ oc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it is aw@@ ful - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 , it is very difficult and then fantastic , and then that happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he we@@ pt .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , it takes six months and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be escaped a red card and the im@@ position of an el@@ et@@ aker .
Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not pun@@ ished the Mexican guy .
van Ga@@ al susp@@ ects that the Italian Ar@@ bit@@ ration had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an el@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws account said : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
referring to this : Manchester United suff@@ ers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in defeat at the PSV
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UK @-@ Def@@ ender has an additional incen@@ tive with the European Championship in France to recover until next June . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PSV @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad at that .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the World Cup in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very hard because it &apos;s not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was moving in a different direction so that it looked like he &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ B@@ S@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be .
I feel very ill with it . I &apos;m sorry .
the PSV @-@ player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to hospital - after a f@@ oul@@ try by Chris Sm@@ urf .
certainly David Cameron wants to know David Cameron The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will learn soon : if your child falls in love with a book , it won &apos;t take long before you know it almost .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the published environmental label by Dr. Se@@ uss , decided in 1971 .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the site of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children , because it always seems to give a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph where Cameron suppos@@ edly describes the story of the book , instead presents a summary of the 2012 film version that added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ in @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , meets the girl of his dreams , &quot; reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was Theodor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel and who died in 1991 , however completely unknown .
as if it were not susp@@ icious enough : the text presented by Cameron reads partially like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the w@@ alled city Th@@ in @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he adm@@ its to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so familiar with the story of the book . here an un@@ named boy , like the local environment due to the gre@@ edy , trees f@@ ake , Th@@ re@@ inde@@ er Once @-@ ler , in spite of the protests of the nam@@ ent Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ering , car@@ ving creature , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; is devast@@ ated .
most likely such a relatively low PR mission was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times a child .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said that the text probably came from Cam@@ er@@ ons Wahl@@ kreis .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cam@@ er@@ ons employees , but gave no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still hard
pushing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one sees the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map .
I would not excl@@ ude an out@@ ward victory .
Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks page may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali developed as a spin bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on test plane is an option for the attack .
this news : Adam Ly@@ th divor@@ ces from England test cad@@ res and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th is of course difficult to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
during his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ mp players are focused on results .
there was no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I &apos;ve said this before - players are their own best selection .
a long time ago , the course of Ly@@ th would have been extended , but he had control of his own destiny .
if he hopefully hits more purchases for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come .
the Great Britain @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude , even though he did not yield so good performances , and that surprised me not ; he is mainly a team man .
the question how much time a test dr@@ ummer gets to set his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven odds - like Sam Rob@@ son in front of him - while Nick comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play back and forth .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first used Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance now lies in the past .
alex H@@ ales enters , and he is a dr@@ ummer , whom I treasure high .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scor@@ ed 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge room , which we met very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must have at least the same opportunities as those in front of him , but this naturally depends on the position of man in the United Arab Emirates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea to hit Mo@@ een next to C@@ ook , which would generate an extra spin bow@@ ler and get four qu@@ icks , emerged , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a dr@@ ummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a cri@@ cket player of cri@@ cket players .
mos@@ ques perhaps did not do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ est@@ ers@@ hire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my former te@@ amm@@ ate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he joined in 2001 as an op@@ ener .
he immediately aboli@@ shed three hundred rounds and did not look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as a Back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him , he impressed me as a young man .
people may see their stat@@ s - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inners who raise their hands and the trainers have decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made a few wise additions to the Train@@ erst@@ ab .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experiences , as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood arrives for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful deployment to the setup .
I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can get fresh wind in the locker room , even if the messages are in line with the predicted .
col@@ ys &apos;s te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used by the One Day@@ er , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team leaders do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Britain &apos;s exit from the EU ) could gain gain if the economy falls into a lu@@ k@@ ew@@ arm by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s in@@ geni@@ ous re @-@ action strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble with every day , even without the choice of the in@@ geni@@ ous Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n becomes the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who suffered severe cr@@ acking due to Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at friend recently said that some member states are deeply involved in various crises such as the EU is now and not always out of their own debt , Britain &apos;s self created agenda with split states and distur@@ bing contractual changes that they usually do not want .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Self@@ ie agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Ministers climb on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local values , come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s all about me .
my European friend who wants an outside UK outside the EU - &quot; Let us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point in which it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s war@@ y ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her , as happened in the excessive periods of har@@ rowing like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Koh@@ l ( 16 ) .
French President François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right @-@ wing government , Spain a lef@@ tist .
it &apos;s hard to imagine that they will rip off a leg to help the self @-@ care British to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may even deliberately not plan helpful ann@@ ot@@ ations , quite in the SN@@ P style , during Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , susp@@ ects my boy@@ friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a P@@ lei@@ te &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won nothing from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their cost and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press area in 1975 , as they were not supported by Tony Ben@@ n in 1975 , which supported our entry 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
you may feel weak at Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opportun@@ ists , who has made a name as a &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s .
in all his mad@@ ness Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
to this end , the Med@@ ley belonged to tax @-@ fear@@ ing vill@@ ains , phone @-@ h@@ ack@@ enden foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ nation@@ als who have most of our big newspapers .
actually Tony Bl@@ air thought about her , but noticed that when sitting with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , one better distri@@ butes ban@@ anas to di@@ stract him instead of becoming his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans as Bl@@ air himself , when he resist@@ ed Cameron &apos;s speech to Cameron , because Bl@@ air had rejected the principle of the non @-@ approved constitution of the EU , which was rejected by French and Dutch vot@@ ers in 2005 , which opened him a back@@ door .
the press has never for@@ given him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly cl@@ ap on the back on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me - seems to repeat N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch strategy of the 80 @-@ he years , a mistake back then and today .
it can take , but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe is - I express it friendly - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff @-@ tendency and the wild chil@@ ds of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ änder@@ ungs can say yes to everyone .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week said when the boy@@ sc@@ outs fought in him , not admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns was a bad idea as a shadow Chancellor .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be loyal to his Labour cab@@ inet@@ makers without going too far and losing his Cab@@ inet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; remain under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ ause on Monday evening .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n - remember that he even touched me - News discipline is important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whir@@ lpool of social media , a breeding facility of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free @-@ card for Europe , which allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks that way .
but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental am@@ big@@ ui@@ ties to the EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Bel@@ ag@@ er@@ ungs @-@ economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dis@@ sident , for which the nar@@ cis@@ s@@ ism of small differences is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his am@@ big@@ ui@@ ties at NATO - Tom Wat@@ son believes that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find in all sense for their su@@ peri@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have susp@@ icious vot@@ ers - in order to make conc@@ essions to the British if this can be all point@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded at the start on Monday of what British Inf@@ lu@@ ence Security Forum called .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health reports on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 persons , some with links to tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by cri@@ tici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( PH@@ E ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Story Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have ques@@ tioned the load capacity of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lanc@@ et last month &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; grab@@ bed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily win@@ dy basis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which PH@@ E founded its most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ ewell , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ de@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that &quot; the present best estimate is that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were con@@ ven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damages of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ ote said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references from BA@@ T to Public Health in a Sustainability Report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ette manufacturer , but not the financing he should have received according to reports beforehand by the tobacco company Philip Morris International .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the Gre@@ y@@ um are not delivered , but these include several well @-@ known E @-@ cigar@@ ettes champ@@ ions , some of which also include a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
the meeting also took part in the Phar@@ ak leadership of PH@@ E .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Group &apos;s research work signi@@ fies that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products in most criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ ewell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the PH@@ E report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ ewell said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes were as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well Being at PH@@ E , said that on the statements of BM@@ J had already been re@@ acted before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second li@@ fel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies at his addi@@ ction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
P@@ he has the un@@ am@@ big@@ uous obligation to inform the public about what evidence proves , and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative dangers in comparison to tobacco .
nearly 8@@ 0,000 people die every year in a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
by presenting current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction .
BBC to give up East@@ En@@ ders , former CEO of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
he cri@@ tici@@ zed the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard controversi@@ al time frames against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers like BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC @-@ General Director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or send , which would also clearly show un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said the Ober@@ haus communication committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , which I don &apos;t consider in the medium or long term for a good idea , one should at least consider its production on programs that others do not make or commissioned .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to reach the wid@@ est possible support for their future .
the idea that otherwise nobody would show this is a jo@@ ke , it &apos;s ridi@@ cul@@ ous , it &apos;s of course non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is funded , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am trying to see how this should be public television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t think this would l@@ essen the BBC ever .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for assess@@ ments &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts show that what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 , suggested that the BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders should sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs &quot; should go to BB@@ C4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they can argue when they go to their apparent missions for justi@@ fying 4 billion pounds of broadcast fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
Johnson said to the committee : &quot; I urge you to find a rather ra@@ iny system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here .
of course , you all think that you get a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 £ a year , I wonder if this is true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein who also said before the committee on Tuesday called for the BBC to check &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform , educ@@ ate and entert@@ ain their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that only little of the BBC production would be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of its TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it was supposed to change in &quot; inform , clarify and entert@@ ain the public @-@ legal TV stations in Australia and Canada . &quot;
to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas like that of the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful on television will be shown , and with commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers Alli@@ ances enter to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ at@@ odes change the direction at the moment they are be@@ amed with sound impulses .
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with gene@@ tically modified ner@@ ves that can be controlled by out@@ bur@@ sts of sound waves .
the tiny Nem@@ at@@ odes change the direction at the moment they have sound impulses that have high frequencies for human hearing to be heard .
the pul@@ ses work through switching mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are gene@@ tically modified to carry out the membrane channels that respond to ultras@@ ound waves .
more on this topic : reading researchers and writing brain activity with light
the researchers said the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , where ultras@@ ound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the dow@@ ns brain stimulation , a invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
thread wor@@ ms usually do not react to ultras@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did it if they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scop@@ ic bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ ound waves , which then penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms .
the ampli@@ fied ultras@@ ound waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P 4 ion@@ aries and found in the membran@@ es of some of the wor@@ ms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells assigned to them , such as a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultras@@ ound @-@ controlled nem@@ at@@ odes , Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically modified wor@@ ms in such a way that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P 4 ion@@ aries .
when applied ultras@@ ound to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bub@@ bles and transferred to the wor@@ ms where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which must be revealed to the desired location in the brain at the desired location in the brain , low frequency ultras@@ ound waves can happen un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neur@@ ons temporarily vulnerable to the ultras@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

but a separate campaign also leads to many posters , which are to be seen at bus stops and in the subway trains and which require a second glance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important announcement : take the DL@@ R ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Do@@ ck@@ lands Light Railway ) from 15 to 18 September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Do@@ ck@@ lands Light Railway ) you read in the characters of the London Underground and the hall@@ mark of the DL@@ R line that turns into the image of a tank . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the 300 posters are designed by artists who have exhibited their work in the Museum of cruel designs in bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy .

another of the Anti @-@ arms trade posters is greeting the comm@@ uter in the subway .

V@@ C@@ CP &apos;s creative director Matt Le@@ ver was aston@@ ished about the silence that reigned around advertising for the Mass - through a emp@@ t@@ ying of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; we give them the campaign to avoid them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic sh@@ ady goo@@ d@@ will , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by blowing with bright colors and animation it will be stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

what we need now is a stepp@@ ing up of the British government and the guarantee that torture instruments are not traff@@ ick@@ ed against our door@@ step .
perhaps the most creative art around the weapons exhibition dates back to the area within Ex@@ Ce@@ L , where exhibitors are fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for living in student resi@@ dences
eleven years ago , I moved as a self @-@ for@@ ged 19 @-@ year @-@ old into a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those I have anger@@ ed - and to the numerous , leng@@ thy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the withdrawal in student resi@@ dences ranges from slightly nerve @-@ writing to absolutely horri@@ fying .
it is temp@@ ting to sh@@ oss : people tell where you are coming , if and where you have taken Sabbath year , where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honest Mar@@ m@@ ite do not love nor hate because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract HA@@ HA@@ HA , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distr@@ acts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your las@@ hes were on fire and these fire ext@@ ingu@@ ish@@ ers would be .
leave people .
the rooms of people often change in drinks recep@@ tions , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also places where people attract and counter@@ act their under@@ wear .
referring to this : do not remember to start with a relationship in the university
intro@@ ver@@ ted receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student accommodation units form a space @-@ to @-@ space bum@@ ble@@ bee culture that is friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I receive the energy I consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted from convi@@ vi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead .
by way of kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ories had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .

as you start the Uni at the high point of the Back Man@@ ie , the kno@@ cking at the doors of people is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have baked something . so , and now please smile if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your ro@@ om@@ mates feel obliged to chat and eventually may associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
poor@@ ly mixed l@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat make people sleep@@ y when you kno@@ ck .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
of course , the ho@@ of of chicken is a theft , but is it the take of a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check this with the dairy owner .
chances are good that they say they themselves serve themselves , even when they cook in the interior .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff is anno@@ ying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it more balanced than my ro@@ omm@@ ate who added to her milk a det@@ erg@@ ent to pun@@ ish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
it is not only about being an decent person , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of speaking to the people sitting in the gl@@ ass@@ room .
a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbours if it makes them a bit more quiet , because there were three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even more loud music .
when she finally got up at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly left her neighbours to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut her door and went to her three @-@ hour check .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would acci@@ dentally move into the same student residence ?
conver@@ sely , it would not be aby@@ sm@@ al embarrass@@ ing if you hold a ro@@ omm@@ ate for your future marriage partner , go to it , separate yourself and see them every day and perhaps experience how to bring together all common friends ?
of course , the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot ro@@ omm@@ ate is definitely not your future marriage partner , you at least try to speak a little reason to your abdom@@ en .

town@@ houses for Refu@@ ge@@ es , Single @-@ Family Housing , Ger@@ ing Com@@ ener
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ den@@ ers builds semi @-@ Fran@@ con@@ ian Eck@@ es town@@ houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living space , but also the only educ@@ ating mother and the poor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how to build cheap and good works today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thousands of refugees will be pushing for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly cheaper living space can be created : he builds in a project town@@ houses for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Gil@@ den@@ ers , many refugees will be pushing for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people stay in a large part here .
in view of the refugee flow , we need enough living space in the next few decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terrac@@ ed house is the solution .
deb@@ tor : a terrac@@ ed house needs the least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different when people are living in blocks of blocks .
each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for each of four asylum seek@@ ers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge .
it can be that many refugees will say it is peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
what is the cost ?
deb@@ tor : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 Euros , without land .
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ deb@@ tor : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have executed my project correctly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially complicated it always makes the imp@@ ending D@@ amo@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert Sonder@@ bau und die Stell@@ platz Ord@@ in@@ ance .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
it is still subordin@@ ated who in a terrac@@ ed house creates three apartments , needs at least three places .
only in the cities the space is missing .
and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terrac@@ ed house project ?
deb@@ tors : there were those who accused me to create luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
what is definitely not true .
but do you not ti@@ gh@@ ten the competition for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : true , we had a construction boom in Germany during the last five years but were built in luxury apartments that can hardly afford more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the only educ@@ ative mother or the less deser@@ ved .
I &apos;ll show you how to build a cheap and cheap way today .
that is what it is about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the adjusting app , tap &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after installation because they get an error message that tells us that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update fails &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are advised to either wait for the rush to go back or attempt to update via iTunes .
the phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the del@@ e@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple has made this more impro@@ b@@ able due to the sli@@ mming of the updates . likewise , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re @-@ install them once the process is complete .
it is worthwhile to make sure your cell phone is charged while updating or is located near a charger so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , as the phone may turn on half way and this could lead to a demoli@@ tion of the update .

bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
the chess club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; , which was founded three months ago , has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players .
the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul Gau@@ sel@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who has spent more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen to K@@ ur .
Gau@@ sel@@ mann is the bear@@ er of the Federal Cross of Mer@@ it 1st class and hon@@ orary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ kamp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
Gau@@ sel@@ mann has supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation , the chairman Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot get the membership fee .
youth work and talent search are also to be pushed forward .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gau@@ sel@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rot @-@ Weiß &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is seen as an expression of his connec@@ t@@ edness with the spa town . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lod@@ g@@ ings Office seeks direct contact
Sal@@ udi@@ s and the Anton@@ isti@@ ft Alten@@ zentrum have joined together under the umbrella of the social foundation and opened a new start @-@ up place at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square .
in addition to consult@@ ations , you can also take part in courses .
the Social Foundation pul@@ ls it down from the mountain into the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square .
a new district office recently opened there .
here , right next to the shopping market , from now on sen@@ iors and coun@@ sel@@ ing information on questions such as care insurance or services of the health care insurance companies .
for years we have been diagnosed with our out@@ patient care service that often car@@ eg@@ i@@ vers are left alone .
there are infin@@ itely many questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , too many services of the insurance companies are not avail@@ ed because the complexity of the insurance companies is scar@@ c@@ ely understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new owner Jutta W@@ eig@@ and , who is responsible for the Anton@@ ist ft and the citizen hospital as well as for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amadeus &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the consult@@ ations , the new district office also offers prevention , health and wellness .
to this end , the sal@@ ine was taken into the boat .
therefore , additional offers such as crash prevention , memory training or physi@@ o@@ therapeutic treatment can be used .
the offers of the Seni@@ or@@ enzentrum and the Sal@@ udi@@ s complement each other ideally .
Sal@@ udi@@ s stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; the Seni@@ or@@ enzentrum for Care and Care , &quot; said Heike Rie@@ del , CEO of Sal@@ udi@@ s .
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre sees both business leaders particularly in demographic change .
for this , a good de@@ centr@@ alised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg is essential in the future .
in addition , Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inaugur@@ ation celebrations , the district office also devoted itself to the meeting at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite you to a regular convi@@ vial gathering . &quot;
with this , the Social Foundation makes a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independent and well as possible in their familiar environment .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and on Satur@@ days between 10 AM and 12 o &apos;clock .

witnesses seek the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 11 : 45 pm , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one out of the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three persons on the premises of the gas station .
one of these men cried out to the young people and beat him with his f@@ ist .
the sacrifice had suffered a nas@@ al @-@ bone frac@@ ture and ble@@ ed strongly from the nose .
when his two friends r@@ ushed and weigh@@ ed on the r@@ ack@@ ets , he first left his victim .
the injured young man was now brought home by his friends .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator persec@@ uted the group with a passenger car up to the apartment and carried out demonstr@@ atively several times .
when you didn &apos;t see the car any more , the wounded went to the building to smoke a cigar@@ ette .
there he was re @-@ attacked by the r@@ ack@@ et and another male person .
under the help of a stroke , one checked on the face and the thig@@ h of the victim .
the injured had to be brought to a hospital for medical care .
up to now there is only a v@@ ague description of the perpet@@ r@@ ator .

Dr. Frank Müller to take over the field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich und Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
furthermore , the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , Economic Development Fund U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwart@@ z and As@@ endor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are pleased .
in many places in the country doctors - As@@ endorf , on the other hand , has luck : there Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice field on October 1st .
while Ur@@ sel starts to reti@@ re , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich returns to his successor in the next few months .
after a reconstruction phase Müller opens the practice on October 12 , until then he will invest 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ u@@ straße 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight , when the ri@@ f@@ ty thousand years ago Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll met , who are currently doing their specialist training at the Golden Hospital and who wants to enter into practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the gar@@ bage cans would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and laugh@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as it was , I simply called them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Eh@@ ep@@ aar Müller liked the idea to practice his own practice in As@@ endorf in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees his own boss .
and so it was agreed that the gar@@ bage collectors bought the house with the practice .
they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the double family father Frank Müller grew up there , his medical studio in Hannover followed the stations in several doctors &quot; sur@@ geri@@ es and in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , in addition he was appointed as a senior physician in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz in 2009 and is involved in voluntary work in the DRC @-@ readiness Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from September 19 the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
during the sur@@ geon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen is a general practitioner , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ ist ) speci@@ alis@@ es in Gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Müll@@ ers , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as hom@@ est@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the renovation , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultras@@ ound examinations as well as long @-@ term and load EC@@ Gs and need a speaking room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a grant from a total of 500@@ 00 Euro is given by the Müll@@ ers as part of a grant program of the district ( 25@@ 000 euros ) and the congregation ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll about 2000 patients come to the field of field breaks according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
in As@@ endorf there is another Haus@@ arz@@ t@@ praxis .
a positive side effect of the practice tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen in As@@ endorf .
if no successor would have found himself , she would have gone .
those who visit the rub@@ b@@ ish of rub@@ b@@ ish are still watching in familiar faces : taking over the seven medical staff and the cleaning power from the ri@@ ms .
with their departure in As@@ endorf an era , after all the medical doctors have practic@@ ed there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ members Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to stay in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will certainly see many patients often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Intern@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , I always pressed myself from gardening , now it could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we let the refugees pass through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are also at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wants to put an asylum application could make this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of people are in the foreg@@ round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear , however , that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people must know that we do not accept bound@@ less migration flows , nor about the Austr@@ o @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia considers &quot; cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia ref@@ uses
the Croatian government had previously announced that even Slovenia would leave forth@@ coming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and possibly er@@ ect cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
the Minister of Interior Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however , did not see this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia is going to intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area .
as the Minister stressed , Slo@@ veni@@ ans will not want to cross its borders for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fulfil its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government was concerned , the first refugees had already tried to pass the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d in the evening hours on Tuesday to avoid the registration .
the Croatian police could pick them up in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media , police vehicles constantly meet with new refugees in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is mainly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days his country with about 4000 refugees calcul@@ ates , said Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ oj@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , were re@@ directed towards Croatia , agreed Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it was to propose certain routes to people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we nor do we do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to media reports , in the morning a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d , during the day further buses would expect .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the passengers were on the road all night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could now actually lead to a displac@@ ement of the previous Balkan @-@ route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west@@ erly direction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive options for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister Ost@@ oj@@ ic stressed earlier that his country prepared for the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees corresponding plans for possible exceptional situations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extensive options for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you carry out strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently witnessed a good evidence of what concerns the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side , there are still 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing HOR@@ GOS , who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings HOR@@ GOS and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked .
whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm on Wednesday morning at a local eye in HOR@@ GOS : he considers the debate on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there would not be a very high number of refugees at the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could not say whether they would continue their journey across Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already started distribut@@ ing maps on which alternative routes through Croatia are drawn .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are even 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance was sent to the border region .
stock @-@ h@@ ackers : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
su@@ pran@@ on@@ ok should have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber crimin@@ als accused of having gained insight into un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ wi@@ red and PR News@@ wire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the information collected , insi@@ ders stores should have been made on the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , a total of over 100 million dollars were shown to the investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our national borders are ultimately tr@@ apped , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the SE@@ C communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trials against 32 further accused in the case continued .
most of the def@@ endants are from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpet@@ rat@@ ors should have acted in both the US and Eastern Europe .
E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
all around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz there is re@@ active operation .
people do their concerns , sometimes fast pac@@ es@@ ight , partly comfortably bum@@ ble .
they control the two stations of the Mannheim car terminal at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep track of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; pul@@ s@@ ating , boun@@ cing life with beautiful autumn sun and middle @-@ thick four big plates each with the head@@ line &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Before I die I want .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid atten@@ tively to its 20th anniversary with this action and is quite faced with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life so we went through the action right in the middle of the city and among men , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid is available to the p@@ asser@@ s as well as questions and talks as well as the voluntary workers .
while some fit spontan@@ eously to the chal@@ k and the sentence around &quot; Mein Leben be@@ j@@ ah@@ en , &quot; &quot; can read &quot; with the camper through the USA , &quot; &quot; stop war &quot; or &quot; not long suffer , &quot; others remain short , read , say sentences like &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and then go on .
over and over again , on the ver@@ ge of small discussions about the action itself , about life , dealing with death .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I make clear to me that some@@ time the end of this world comes , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband Mannheim &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ö@@ kum@@ en@@ ischen Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , this public effective action is good for the 20 year old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , that everyone does not want to communicate publicly on the boards , but be understand@@ able , after all , it is a very personal matter .
the topic of death and death was still associated with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ otion in recent years has contributed much to the fact that people are opening up .
an assessment that Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id shares .
the death and mour@@ ning director is one of the hon@@ orary members of the first hour .
confronted by personal experiences with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce A@@ id was seeking volunteers , she immediately reported and was part of the founding in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and members in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in hos@@ pi@@ ce Saint Vincent .
they all have been carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id can cope well with her job and experience and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another waiting , think it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of the ambul@@ ant ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and non @-@ denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insurance and donations of relatives and associations allows the training as well as training and supervision of mort@@ al and fun@@ eral companions .

Fed@@ Ex @-@ Result Mix@@ ed , Financial prospects for 2016 lo@@ wered
Fed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supply gig@@ ant lo@@ wered his earnings outlook for a whole year because of the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service .
the company also said that she plans to hire about 55@@ .000 seasonal workers for holidays .
at this point last year , Fed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell over 2.5 percent in pre @-@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
Fed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit of $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in the financial year , which ends in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast .
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower view comes despite the price increases , which amount to 4.@@ 9 per cent and effective on January 4 , despite higher sur@@ charges for bo@@ d@@ der transport of heavy and large packages that will be collected from November .
the company said it nonetheless expects that the result will increase over the previous year because of cost reduction , higher income and growth in online retail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company will yield &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid earnings , considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in production and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for holidays employment were announced one day later than that of the ri@@ val U@@ PS that plans to employ 9@@ 0,000 to 95@@ .000 additional labour forces , about the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , Fed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million $ , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve analysts predicted by Z@@ acks Investment Research .
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion US $ .
six of Z@@ acks ques@@ tioned analysts expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
Fed@@ Ex has under@@ gone a decline in international pri@@ ori@@ tis@@ ation over the past few years , which brought the sales in his unit express shipping to a halt .
but the boom in online shopping increased the results at Fed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter sales increased by 29 percent at the bo@@ d@@ der transport , but the operating result was flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit recorded higher income due to higher prices , while the result fell due to higher labour costs in the cargo business .
in pre @-@ market trading , about an hour before the opening , Fed@@ Ex share declined by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to € 15@@ 0,@@ 15 .
on Tuesday , they included 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most anticipated meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists spend two days this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to lift the Lei@@ tz@@ ins for the first time for almost a decade .
above them at the end of the decorated , two @-@ story seat hall is a m@@ ural of the United States .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues shall put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the Central Bank has a two @-@ fold order from the Congress : maxim@@ izing US occupation and prices here stable .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too tight to predi@@ ct it . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be p@@ amper@@ ed by the unprecedented incen@@ tive by the near @-@ zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data on the economy show that they are solid , the latest turbul@@ ence in the global financial markets could fri@@ gh@@ ten the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives to rein@@ force this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal loans - and be it just a quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they are observing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Princip@@ al Econom@@ ist at the Mak@@ ler@@ firm Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text not to increase interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justi@@ fication to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no con@@ sensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which insur@@ es itself to the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists , recently survey@@ ed by Blo@@ om@@ berg , have predicted an interest rate this week .
the financial markets however expect to wait for F@@ ed , with a key indicator , which shows only a 30 % chance for an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the pro@@ position unless the strateg@@ ists decrease the strike by promising that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value jump@@ ed at 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was raised by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she does it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her statement to calm down the financial markets so that they do not panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that interest @-@ raising would calm the financial markets because they would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
another month ago , the F@@ ed seemed good to raise the sentence by 0.25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow intensi@@ fication of monetary conditions which would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that in this year , despite the dis@@ comfort of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the sentence is expected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the job creation in August slow@@ ed down , improvement in the labour market was solid this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed looks as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation went steadily under the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary action of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world came together at the end of last month after China had de@@ valued its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value fell by more than 16 % in May , as investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would th@@ rot@@ tle global growth .
the market has recovered slightly this month , whereby the D@@ ow is now around 10 % below the peak of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation when one should raise interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy have not occurred in the last few weeks , they would pull the re@@ ins in this session , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the U.S. staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predi@@ cts that she will wait at least a month to get a grip on the effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy , and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the world economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be involved in decision making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world .
the influence of the Central Bank has been enormous in recent years .
the mere indication of the former director , Ben S. Bern@@ anke , in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow &quot; its monetary expansion , del@@ etes the del@@ usions around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can expect that they do not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy for the asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of re@@ treats on financial market movements that are apparently not associated with economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
L@@ acker , Member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who advoc@@ ates a interest in interest , made decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to cut its Lei@@ tz@@ ins by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited recognis@@ able effects on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives were revers@@ ing these cuts .
the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market crash , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee for the Bank of England &apos;s interest rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest turbul@@ ences do not come near that level , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she fears a interest increase because the markets are up@@ set , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peters@@ on Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until this is changed I don &apos;t think it should be ha@@ sty for the time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ sh@@ ilfe for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
to give you a warm welcome , not without the commitment of inn@@ um@@ erable volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
they belong to Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still likes to teach with her 74 songs .
every Thursday she is doing it in the asylum @-@ seek@@ ers home on D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , it is quite different teaching than at a proper school .
Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric society Rio Grande encourages nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric organization Spr@@ S tries to educ@@ ate women in a sho@@ cking way how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . she does this with the presentation of images of babies who su@@ ck on breasts which are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by around 500 calories per day .
however , new research results suggest that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should carry out .
a current study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ors .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new ber@@ n@@ rie@@ der sports hall
the municipal council of Bern@@ ried approved the building application for the 2.3 million euros costly sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited gymn@@ as@@ tics building at the ber@@ n@@ rie@@ der sports grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : in the most recent meeting of the community , the elabor@@ ated building application was un@@ anim@@ ously approved without large discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee has previously decided to submit an application for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the valid development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permission of a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ standard First and roof over@@ hang &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be built . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar plants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in turn , in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; there was a tendency to rise above ten degrees for energetic reasons - unlike in the cultivation plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was necessary because the plan of construction ad@@ missible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to the roof incl@@ ination - whereby the local council is usually rather restric@@ tive when it comes to liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , when it comes to gymn@@ as@@ tics , this is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create any preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gymn@@ asi@@ um building at the Sports Centre is a community project of the municipality and the SV Bern@@ ried .
about 2.3 million euros are calculated at the expense of costs .
subsidies are expected from school and l@@ ati@@ tudes .
in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 metre hall is now presented to the Land@@ rat@@ samt .
Klinik Pei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the Pei@@ ßen@@ berg Hospital should be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed new medical director at Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station as well as the majority of employees move from Pei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
these are the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the county , who confirmed the Coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or Andrea Joch@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board , and the next Wednesday , September 23 .
if the plans are to be implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees would be employed at the hospital in Pei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the existing In@@ ner Station .
the rooms are present .
the employees who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so Joch@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the employees are informed about the plans .
the change of dismis@@ sal by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ au Clinic since the beginning of the year , has now moved to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
on the question of who to follow the succession , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play with the name &quot; Fischer &quot; who agreed to take over the lead from October 1 and exchange with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this yields a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a broad@@ ening of the offer in the field of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Joch@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialised in the In@@ ner Station on g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
if the Supervisory Board agre@@ es to agree on both houses until then next year , the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ schaft , which has 35 beds , will finally be shut down in Pei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the District Circle had planned this for 2018 , when the ongoing renovation at Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital has been completed .
Coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or Joch@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , advoc@@ ates that the house , which is in possession of the Bundes@@ kn@@ app@@ schaft , shall in future be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I close it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , Joch@@ ner @-@ white could not say , there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a meeting sy@@ chiat@@ ry located .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fischer about the quasi @-@ move to the Le@@ ch , who had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for more than 30 years , I have not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the Pei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened with closure in recent decades , det@@ ach@@ ments have been closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .
the hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are called ton@@ ight ( 8 : 15 pm ) at the Berg@@ ischen HC .
the leader of the Bundes@@ liga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal , but there is none .
in the past season , the bad@@ ener referred to a painful defeat at the B@@ HC and have been doing something there .
hunting ev@@ ap@@ oration with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers were severely injured during their ma@@ ize harvest in the afternoon by shots .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a Ma@@ is@@ feld near Pr@@ at@@ au ( District of Witt@@ enberg ) , several h@@ unters were in use , as the police broke .
after a shot @-@ off , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly it could happen to the accident was un@@ clear at first .

missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violence
a susp@@ ect has led the police to the cor@@ p@@ se of 16 @-@ year @-@ old people from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
in inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted to have killed the yo@@ ung@@ sters and cast their dead bodies into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate has been missing since Saturday .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police on Wednesday .
as a susp@@ ect one also applies on Tuesday evening recorded 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who de@@ ed according to the statement and the investig@@ ators lead to the discovery site of the cor@@ p@@ ses .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was missing on Sunday morning after she had@@ n &apos;t come home after a visit to a autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
when searching for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first came to personal objects of the victim .
inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ations in the circle of friends and acquain@@ t@@ ances of the missing persons finally resulted in a crime against the 20 @-@ year @-@ olds .
the alleged perpet@@ r@@ ator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the body was found .
according to the authorities , the det@@ ain@@ ee reported the police inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation to kill the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the dead in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was supposed to be introduced on Wednesday the por@@ ridge , the investig@@ ators lay down the burden for it .
the closer circumstances of action shall bring further investigation .
refugees need accommodation : study war@@ ns of the om@@ ission
the situation in the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for affordable p@@ encils .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing construction faces a challenge .
the distribution of distribution on the German housing market has long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the coming refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market already over@@ loaded in many large cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
to cover demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 every year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this results in a study commissioned by the Association of Con@@ federation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison : this year , 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany .
thus , 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer oblig@@ ated to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an emergency accommodation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many then come to the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartment rentals .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived for rent in the last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the study also makes significant short@@ com@@ ings in the housing policy of recent years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany sho@@ ots a housing defic@@ it that is increasing from year to year .
currently , around 77@@ 0,000 residential units were missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Günther compl@@ ains , author of the study .
therefore , many working people lived in large cities as well as in flat @-@ rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults stay un@@ inten@@ tionally in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the F@@ lau@@ te in the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the large cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has fallen for the first time in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new incentives are to boost the social housing construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is how to ren@@ ounce the tax rate tax and be subject to the tax on subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , according to Bün@@ dnis attractive tax de@@ preci@@ ation options are necessary .
the funding programme for refugee shel@@ ters from the Kf@@ W is already well @-@ known in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the available 300 million euros have been rec@@ alled on Monday evening with 184 million euros .
now the project could be even sho@@ cked .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia align cor@@ ridor
after Hungary there is practically no escape any more , since more and more refugees choose the way to Croatia .
Zagreb announces the transit through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to the Sloven@@ ian Minister of Interior , and if necessary , we will organize a cor@@ ridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ oj@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the deport@@ ation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people came across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian TV channel RT@@ L .
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the day before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new laws which came into force on the same day make it virtually unnecessary for ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can travel through and we prepare for this opportunity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police took up the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring country of Croatia .
according to most reported media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both by bus and tax@@ is to the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to reach Croatia by foot on the green border .
on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not viol@@ ate borders .
for this the border strip contains other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
mine clear@@ ers should now quickly create a safe passage .
after Hungary , after the closure of the border , hardly any more refugees arrive .
on Tuesday the police en@@ um@@ er@@ ated 366 challenged people .
just before closing on Monday it was still 93@@ 80 .
the new Hungarian law stages the over@@ coming and damage of the border zone as a criminal off@@ ence .
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the condemned thre@@ aten adhesi@@ on pen@@ alties of up to five years and the deport@@ ation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ ones &quot; border , including nearly all of them - 93 - at the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants , 13 families with small children and two elderly people are among the applicants .
on Wednesday morning , 40 refugees would have stopped there .
practically , however , no one has a chance to get granted asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should be deport@@ ed there .
a few hundred refugees assembled in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in front of the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to clean up .
they gathered the gar@@ bage that tens of thousands of people left at the road@@ side in recent weeks .
barrier gr@@ illes were demoli@@ shed and one of the record stores in the border town was reconstructed .
no one wanted to utter this radical change .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria reaches only a few refugees .
the country also strengthened its border controls .
but about 20,000 migrants were still in the country after government declar@@ ations .
in Salzburg about 1400 people are waiting for the drive to Germany .
the train from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ lass@@ ing there were regularly smaller groups of refugees on foot .
Mayor continued &quot; ge@@ str@@ and@@ ete &quot; across the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the bridge festival on Sunday we were busy with the clearing , when ten people suddenly stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ ern@@ stein Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to take the train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany was surprisingly opposed to Austria on Sunday because of the refugee flow , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein at the end , &quot; so Stad@@ ler who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ ced the borders together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into the Nah@@ e Pass@@ au .
previously we have tast@@ ed the un@@ wa@@ ver@@ ed guests only once , with snack and drinks .
we have said the same , we bring them to Pass@@ au by car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let it take a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has been a pleasure for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers climb@@ ed from a ICE to a regional train in Wels on Sunday evening in a regional train in the direction of Pass@@ au , after the short @-@ term pro@@ clam@@ ation that the rail traffic was stopped to Germany , but still to try across the border .
but the regional train was set off at the Inn before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border cross border is generally high in the course .
the bridge festival with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably linked together with the Bavarian neighbours - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends more tens of thousands to us , is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
instead of helping in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately in the establishment of structures that ensure humanity , our Chancellor has promoted the position of the Hungarian government in the sphere of National Socialism .
leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the p@@ oul@@ try will also find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pro@@ mis@@ ed Land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; invited them to welcome nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge in the face of the ongoing flow of refugees and the coming winter , to produce decent conditions for protection seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be an even greater - peace , security and stability to sust@@ ain in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35,@@ 000 winter@@ proof quartz
Konrad has all the hands to do with the refugees .
Christian Konrad is ac@@ custom@@ ed to his word weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to set up lod@@ g@@ ings for the thousands of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad has already got a grip on the chaos in the first reception centre in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no more hom@@ eless in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also , the lodging of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without great vor@@ ti@@ ces , said Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; master output . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crisis situation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Konrad is counting on a demand of 8@@ 5,000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ ly year .
in order to meet the number , 35,@@ 000 accommodation must be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 the countries should provide , 15,@@ 000 the federal government .
should there be more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the provincial capit@@ als .
they would have assured him , also to create lod@@ g@@ ings for the coming refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria it goes well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , which will be clari@@ fied as the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum co @-@ ordin@@ ator sets great expectations in the ORF promotion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ping as We &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , private individuals can offer un@@ complicated accommodations .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are vac@@ ant in winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for placing as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in emer@@ gen@@ cies , it cannot be that lod@@ g@@ ings have to hold a certain height of the towel holder or size of the height .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not@@ ch standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would need to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , he is more successful in placing his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an elderly gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er have no cost of the Republic as they explained themselves .
they want to increase their number of employees in three to four .
so far , his own lod@@ g@@ ings have not been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to put a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz calls for a better distribution
the city of Linz plans no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings , such as tips @-@ arena and design center for lodging of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as one can currently under@@ estimate those affected without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further sites should be checked for their suit@@ ability .
criticism is exer@@ ted by the City of the City in the division of refugees within the federal state .
other districts also have to make their contribution .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday set out the further action in the refugee issue .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders are not sealed .
the continued departure of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible .
however , there is now the corresponding border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special trains with refugees in Germany will not give it any more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the seek@@ ers would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger asked once more for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria also carries out controls at its borders is a logical consequence for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ ühr@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general refur@@ bish@@ ment of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Linz industry line is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T has moved , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be le@@ ased to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in startup companies of the New ship@@ yard and later to acquire some of them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neigh@@ bors - from which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises some promises : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
1.7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which is one third of the city of Linz , the Land of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased from Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters remaining space in the building are already rented , for another 40 per cent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second store in the ar@@ cade
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
Jutta Br@@ eit wanted to have a dog .
this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , she has now received growth in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , where they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are starting at 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously it was rebuilt several weeks ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long considered if I should still open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
decisive for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna are also driven by the idea of their own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the large space of Linz who sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has given birth from her mother to the cra@@ dle .
I like most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture can &apos;t answer the specialist with last safety .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag evalu@@ ates every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump arrived from a place whose residents are called an@@ em@@ ers .
this property also links to the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
whether it expresses an@@ x@@ en@@ opho@@ bic , journalists are concerned or reve@@ aling knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the applicant for the US presidential office power@@ fully stimul@@ ates the election campaign .
and cuts off well .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate town of K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate @-@ billi@@ on@@ aire origin@@ ate .
the New Yorker with the F@@ öhn@@ schu@@ ur is a term for many in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the wine road .
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants @-@ place is related about -@@ zig corners with it .
his grand@@ father came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ terin Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think of being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find that somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ Town &apos;s way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has fil@@ med a fun documentary about the place and his famous sp@@ rou@@ ts , to which besides Tr@@ ump the k@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz is one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , which is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to word in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he certainly would be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tends to give the opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; is already a bit of a big mouth , &quot; Wen@@ del says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circum@@ ference , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - to High German : the gi@@ ver , says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the gi@@ ver .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grand@@ father emig@@ rated and opened a pub for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
foundation stone of the real estate group were first land purchases in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of trag@@ edy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed in the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged .
he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he was once distr@@ acted without permission , the director of the Institute for pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Geschichte und Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , was declared a film start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is in contrast to the sometimes marked conclusions of desc@@ ending .
he repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he does , this is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim B@@ ender , a distant relative tr@@ umps ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement fores@@ ees the American rather dist@@ ancing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so up@@ set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the Pen@@ sion@@ ist Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ramm insi@@ sts like many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz family donated a visit to the church organ in general , which is generally well anch@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine this by Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they find it better if he did not want the choice , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the plague at the time of his grand@@ father in the US would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting subjects than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ri@@ pe even without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els Film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12 000 movie singers , also in the USA the interest awak@@ ens .

seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take the loss of leadership in the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ k@@ inson ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but no major shifts in the today &apos;s reviews .
the N@@ ine breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the Riv@@ ale Sun@@ rise , with the present@@ ers David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a week series of international television broad@@ casts , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this dis@@ advantage of the distance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , since Sun@@ rise scor@@ ed 39@@ 7,@@ 000 spectators at the five main cities compared to today 33@@ 9@@ .000 .
today , a slight increase in the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17,@@ 000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today it closed the gap to sunrise in the past few months .
in August , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18,@@ 000 compared to the 33@@ 0,000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance ran between 4@@ 0,000 and 50,000 .
so far , sunrise on average 34@@ 9,@@ 000 spectators has risen to 3@@ 14,@@ 000 at Today .
this is the most interesting thing every morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the winds of change concern these mor@@ ays more than the Parliament ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently we@@ ather@@ ed father , who decided to settle on New Zealand &apos;s coast with his two children , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million viewers .
critics had asked if Thom@@ son could wear a hit show solo without the ra@@ fting Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million spectators and hit The Block ( 8@@ 38@@ .000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26,@@ 000 ) .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secret reveals ? ...
Lana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki obviously have unk@@ now@@ ingly revealed who The Bachelor gains .
the woman , finally landing at Sam Wood in The bach@@ el@@ or , was wrapped in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three two , you may have acci@@ dentally given a hint about who will be the winner .
Sam Wood stays firmly sealed until the final on Thursday
all three women have failed in a ly@@ rical way why Wood is the perfect man and they called his sense of hum@@ our , am@@ bition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get the Woods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be their answers to the game destro@@ yer who won the heart of the bach@@ el@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both quickly - besides themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and ( Sarah ) and S@@ ams energies noticed that they were quite compatible , and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah is standing on earth with both feet , it makes so much fun to be together with her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
you feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to the house last week made her clear that wood could be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ reserv@@ edly set on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked whom Wood should choose , if not she , then she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .
the Bachelor will be broadcast on Ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his NF@@ L career .
Det@@ roit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams that sent en@@ quiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ nes for the rest of the game to the Bank when he lost a tie as he did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ sions on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a p@@ unt return and also to the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ rep@@ orter of Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special teams coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his scrat@@ ched catch and to take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a p@@ unt , which was restored in the first game quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start , Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers were hoping for his NF@@ L debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start to his NF@@ L career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens now , one takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut then in 2007 , when a pass was leading to a Tr@@ y for Que@@ ens@@ land in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

free vot@@ ers demand the setting of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees .
party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ v@@ anger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W Aut@@ umn Conference in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt before a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools when there is no new teacher for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to preserve the schools before collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get trials in the Bavarian educational system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ tag fraction of the free vot@@ ers is ad@@ jour@@ ned until Friday in the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ian commun@@ e .
actually quite other main topics were planned .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the issue of asylum is over@@ bearing the Klau@@ sur , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ v@@ anger demanded the establishment of UN protective zones for refugees in Syria , as it was during the Yugoslavia wars in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it goes no further , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free choice of elec@@ torate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to post@@ p@@ one the free vot@@ ers as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason Ai@@ v@@ anger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum claims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W CEO cri@@ tici@@ zed that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards of federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria p@@ ushes away , others do not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become hand@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the national policy in a big wall@@ stadt is not to fall under the table .
a long standing tor@@ ch remains on the agenda : the education policy .
at 47 gymn@@ asi@@ es , the Minister of Education Ludwig Sp@@ a@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) initiated the pilot test &quot; Mittel@@ stufe plus &quot; at 47 gymn@@ asi@@ es for the new school year in which an extension of the gymn@@ asi@@ tical intermediate level of three to four years is tested .
but Ai@@ v@@ anger is not far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot;

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shoot the prot@@ esters in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police poured rubber @-@ stor@@ eys into a crowd , demonstr@@ ating against the proposed new constitution , said a civil servant on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ expands , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mand@@ u .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad Dh@@ ak@@ al , senior official official , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , some of them war@@ n stones and bom@@ bs .
Mr Dh@@ ak@@ al said the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before they res@@ orted to the rubber floor .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the used rubber floor , known to which they can kill , but are traditionally used as a less le@@ thal alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the confront@@ ation was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern pl@@ ains , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces which are formed within the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent confront@@ ations since the 10th century .
in August when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversi@@ al issue in Nepal , which has been centrally ruled for centuries .
working on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ature accelerated the process after the devast@@ ating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the leg@@ is@@ lators have voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional draft in Kath@@ mand@@ u , and officials have said that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday .

but it is good to meet all rum@@ ours now .
sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch .
violent reactions from gu@@ inea people who had come to the meeting called out the pictures and new details for the desired hotel construction .
Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea bu@@ den@@ ers and board member of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; this will be a huge cl@@ oning that over@@ looks all the other buildings . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears like a number of other project critics , that the traffic would increase sharp@@ ly by the intended size of the system : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be whole bus loads , so that it pays off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Schulz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on one hect@@ are area of the former inn , however , is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we need to have a coher@@ ent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot;

I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are looking for help .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing help for refugees and migrants : doctors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global funds raised up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ g@@ le.com / night may be doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many also escaped from the war torn by war , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily over@@ weight diabe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery longer live than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mort@@ ality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial on the new study in J@@ AMA Surgery .
weight loss surgery or obes@@ ity surgery , use different methods to reduce the magn@@ itude of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obes@@ ity surgery has proven to be efficient for type 2 diabetes , but most of the studies have been carried out in people who are obes@@ e obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered to be normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is over@@ weight and people with BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ese Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data that have been collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obes@@ ity surgery - gast@@ ric b@@ ypass and gast@@ ric tu@@ bel@@ ess formation - medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily over@@ weight .
the average BM@@ I among those subjected to this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments roughly equal to 29 .
among those who undergo a surgical procedure , 36 % dis@@ sol@@ ves the diabetes disease completely and partially at 28 % .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , in comparison to the diabetes , only about one percent and partially at only about 2 percent .
in addition , the results were found in the control of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Chol@@ ester@@ ins &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the patient blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , write the researchers .
after surgery , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c fell from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical therapy group it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mort@@ ality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compar@@ es average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ re@@ kt@@ om@@ ie group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14,@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater decline in BM@@ I ( 7.4 against 5.1 ) and hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and more than a complete over@@ coming of the diabetes ( 46.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are references from a study of he@@ avier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was with obes@@ e people who under@@ went an obes@@ ity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
although the new study did not benefit survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it is cal@@ ming for people with a BM@@ I below 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes , which have firmly joined their bodies with obes@@ ity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;
love story plays in the Hun@@ sr@@ ück
it is an issue that is currently increasingly popular in Bell@@ etr@@ istik : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ fair , meets after years the flock of her youth , and she falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting especially for Hun@@ s@@ rück@@ er readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the full @-@ time writer grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot absorb all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan @-@ Buddh@@ ist leader asked to end the violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford that dedic@@ ates itself to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also emphas@@ ised that the reaction of Western European countries is ad@@ mi@@ red to the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to tackle the crisis , he emphasized that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you must think about long @-@ term solutions , such as genuine peace and genuine development , mainly through education that can be created for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we have to think about how the killing is reduced in their countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s action following the terrorist attack on September 11 , claiming that the violent reaction of the US drag@@ ged a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my p@@ ity in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to resolve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence , and this has caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;

po@@ ison control centres in the United States report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years of age , which swal@@ low strongly alcoholic drinks inf@@ ect@@ ants such as Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , cases of revenue from hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age , the po@@ ison control centres reported , from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are getting more and more common to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them will go in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant inten@@ tionally while some do it to im@@ press their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how adol@@ escents drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant just because of a cheap experience .
yo@@ ung@@ sters have allegedly bl@@ ended dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing mou@@ th@@ wash to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those that are perf@@ umed .
there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with stra@@ w@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very appealing to children .
dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially with inf@@ ants , few sp@@ las@@ hes can lead to alcohol in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the tox@@ ins emergency centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the station Fox 4 in kan@@ sa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave a si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , then it &apos;s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , recently taken four sp@@ las@@ hes from after stra@@ w@@ berry frag@@ rant dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant at school , was brought to treatment in an emergency room .
her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice greater than the threshold that is legally dr@@ unk in an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a emergency medical doctor , who treated them in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah had her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the signs of Hir@@ n trau@@ ma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had encountered his head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ jah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and to store hands dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant outside the reach of the child .
beyond alcohol in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women after swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants containing toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
health authorities staff susp@@ ect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was listed as active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth grade in the New York State planned to po@@ ison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by putting anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; says a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to san@@ iti@@ zer and ban@@ ished her from her room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police regarded the s@@ worn plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gesch@@ wä@@ tz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and referred to disciplinary action to the school authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vill@@ ingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged

a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver sail@@ ed towards the round@@ about in the direction of the industrial area and too late noticed that at the round@@ about two cars had stopped .
as a result , he jump@@ ed into the rear of an audit with his truck and pushed this vehicle to a standing Ford Fi@@ esta .
in the accident @-@ taking vehicles , property damage was about 10 000 euros , the police for@@ ks .

D@@ ons raise lead over Celtic to five points
Adam Ro@@ on@@ ey &apos;s El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time gave Aber@@ de@@ en a scar@@ ce victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e , so that the D@@ ons create a five @-@ point gap between themselves and Celtic .
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays Ger@@ ede on Dis@@ harmony
there are rum@@ ours about di@@ shar@@ mony at Celtic Glas@@ gow , which was spontan@@ eously rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths . he insi@@ sted that he and his team mates were not under increased control since they were preparing for confront@@ ation with the Dutch leader .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scot@@ tish football boring pre@@ cip@@ ants - de Bo@@ er
former Rang@@ ers Mittel@@ feld player and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of Celtic games more and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here are not only talking about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they speak about the Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and this is what they are interested .
there is a lot of tension in the Old Firm Play , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , sw@@ ears Dei@@ la .
R@@ onn@@ y Dei@@ la accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wor@@ e to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ de@@ en , who now with five points ahead clearly stood at the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel this exactly like that - but we have to go on .
we really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players better .
working together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton cau@@ ti@@ ously in January @-@ transfers
despite his comments just a few weeks ago , pointing out that he made a few January @-@ transfers , Rang@@ ers boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious when signing new in@@ accessible and insi@@ sts that he doesn &apos;t want to distur@@ b the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x Ka@@ der@@ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer @-@ window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
players who come in the summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage will be done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said , and per@@ si@@ sts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not ques@@ tioned integrity , I have not commented on performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the stor@@ mer and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s safe to say that I don &apos;t return to Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le if it doesn &apos;t play for Celtic Glas@@ gow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es glad to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; win &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Hamilton . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es adm@@ its that his team of Aber@@ de@@ en had to fight against Hamilton Ac@@ cies in order to see a seventh consecutive le@@ ague victory that brought them a lead of five points ahead of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ on@@ ey &apos;s El@@ f@@ meter in the first half .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that won everything in poker games or le@@ agues , which have not won games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged as it grows in the UK .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July , unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without labor for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 per cent was about 5.5 per cent of the total of 5.5 per cent , as demonstrated by the figures of the Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) .
in the meantime , the employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ .000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,@@ 000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly one year ago that Scotland has made the historical decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scot@@ tish job market with an increase in employment and a drop in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unken distur@@ bs the drain
as the security personnel could not be able to manage the situation , the employees called the police .

why I shall be a witness to an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
if it happens , and I hope that it doesn &apos;t happen , I will sit in a spec@@ t@@ ator gallery in the Death Chamber in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p is executed by the gyp@@ sum sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation was for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked I agreed .
when the day drew near , I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and as there are often more applications available than seats , a ma@@ ke@@ er lot@@ tery takes place to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
who is selected , he will observe it emoti@@ onally .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard Gl@@ ory &apos;s closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter to aband@@ on my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prison@@ er how he wants it and you get access .
I compl@@ ained with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could have been more form@@ ulating &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks it is wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international rep@@ orter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations work will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a rep@@ orter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the pod@@ casts that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go into detail here again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Gl@@ ossi@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Bar@@ ry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a benef@@ ici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that a strong lik@@ eli@@ hood is that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other rep@@ or@@ ters to which you can turn to this .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death .
man after dam@@ p police ch@@ ase persu@@ ades to come from the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist remained dry when he over@@ came the man from the C@@ anning River .
an attempt of a man of Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to exc@@ el him gently to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called on Tuesday to a break @-@ in incident at Becken@@ ham .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them towards the C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was in the water and said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable strategy - &quot; A good polic@@ eman negoti@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine .
champion football player Ben Cou@@ sins offers an unforgettable example .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that st@@ ew@@ ards tried to sp@@ y him out and threat@@ ens to end race sport
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that Stew@@ ards from Racing Victoria tried to install a sp@@ y in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he directed to the st@@ ew@@ ards and the integrity section of Racing Victoria and claimed that they performed a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last stra@@ w on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions as it was about the positive cob@@ alt @-@ sw@@ ab test at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had with@@ held 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age alle@@ g@@ ations and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like too high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I have said .
I will go home ton@@ ight and sleep well .
I &apos;d like to walk up@@ lifted and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a trainer .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously Moo@@ dy had let the bomb blast in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integrity section had tried to sp@@ y out his stall .
&quot; eighte@@ en months Terr@@ y Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stew@@ art in a room with a man - whom I will name when I am asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; Moo@@ dy said on rac@@ ing.com .
they obviously believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if that is the case , they should surely believe in their n@@ oses because they have failed to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the RV@@ L , David Moo@@ die , acting President of the RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the RV@@ L , were aware of the time and are still today .
should this make me think that it will be personal ?
does the RV@@ L behave co@@ war@@ dly and perhaps makes people outside trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe the people think out there that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and for@@ sake me , and I have no doubt that what I say they can now think about it .
but I arrived at the point where that doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
this makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and press them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the fru@@ stration levels of the trainer have built up with Li@@ dar@@ i &apos;s long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt research , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching demonstrated that he was able to throw &quot; his license over the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the beaten Master black Caviar , described the race day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ cul@@ ous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied on the horse deb@@ th , which th@@ ru@@ sted against the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing sports . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my staff has er@@ ron@@ eously applied mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been so yesterday the whole day , which was so .
but it also had the same on the day of the race .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the racing day . an examination of this matter has been opened .
it is a jo@@ ke .
people who set these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy hits ri@@ vals for claims to ring fight back
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favourites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson rep@@ lied that the Ar@@ bit@@ ters allowed the Storm @-@ Player &quot; Ring@@ champ@@ ions &quot; with his team during the high storm tro@@ phy in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne Benn@@ ett made a hardly cover@@ t note to the Storm team after his team reached the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample play &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not too good &quot; in the struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy def@@ ended the T@@ ack@@ li@@ mg of his crew and said they were focused only on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Tac@@ kling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team makes him feel confident , because they were worried about being struck by the Storm team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is repeated over and over again - I haven &apos;t heard Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring competitions when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that in the whole year we have changed nothing to our def@@ ensive system or the techniques . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kl@@ es a real center of gravity , and that has provided us the trend revers@@ al .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not ac@@ custom@@ ed to getting used to it , so it was a bit a shock for him .
it &apos;s funny how this is coming up again and again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy attacked Benn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his play on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that St George was cri@@ tici@@ zed as a te@@ di@@ ous team in 2010 , and Wayne said he will take care of a sc@@ andal .
but now he has a team that can play and that we consider exciting , especially its young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of player .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt , so they can play as they can .
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think of us when it comes to big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against co@@ w@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are breaks and no points a little ten@@ sion@@ ing ?
for me it is the game &apos;s plans .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a phase .
the Storm team has fre@@ ed this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land co@@ w@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks at the next Saturday evening at the A@@ AMI Park . ticket sales begin from next Tuesday morning .
Serbian with 200@@ ,000 $ deposit on drug suit
a man who possibly threat@@ ens a li@@ fel@@ ong punishment due to his attempt to get into possession of 40 kilo@@ grams of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200@@ ,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the ship Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was watched as he met his co @-@ accused in the morning and later at Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilo@@ grams of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a possibly li@@ fel@@ ong punishment for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argu@@ ed that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the café he could have been a harm@@ less reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was worried about the risk of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday .

Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs &apos; mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200@@ ,000 dollars as security to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the secret declar@@ ations of the two people it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200@@ ,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jud@@ ges Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;

St@@ ev@@ an Hog@@ g used phone from girls to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ oph@@ iles to send pictures
a pa@@ ed@@ oph@@ ile used the phone of an 11 year old girl to request images of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Hog@@ g accepted the phone of the girl when he fell as@@ leep , logged in an online mess@@ aging service from which he received a number of un@@ decent pictures of children sent to him by another user .
the girl wo@@ ke up later and discovered that the phone lack@@ ed and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hog@@ g .
she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and instantly al@@ er@@ ted her mother .
the police took care of it and looked at the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web research , which used terms for the search for un@@ decent images of children .
Hog@@ g then claimed that he did it because it would lead to &quot; P@@ äd@@ oph@@ ile on the Internet &quot; and he then &quot; pret@@ ended to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ gh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the At@@ tor@@ ney E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be a addi@@ ction to fri@@ gh@@ ten people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that the search on the computer were carried out by him , but said it was going to happen because he wanted to pret@@ end to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ gh@@ ten P@@ äd@@ oph@@ ile .
he was asked after his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was on tre@@ mb@@ ling and cr@@ ying .
she then saw the un@@ decent pictures on the phone and con@@ front the def@@ endants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said the def@@ endant used computer and play@@ station to talk to girls who looked much younger than he did .
Hog@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty in terms of the indictment , to have taken un@@ decent pictures of children on 14 June last year , to have been viol@@ ated on 25 January of this year , and not before the court to appear at a hearing on 24 March this year .
defence lawyer Greg@@ ory S@@ im asked that Hog@@ g wouldn &apos;t appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , as one could argue that &quot; there is no significant sexual element &quot; in his crime .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mich@@ ael makes the verdi@@ ct until October to receive background reports on social work .
Hog@@ g was in this case security deposit granted , but was held in custo@@ dy for hear@@ ings to other still outstanding instances .
he was taken up before the date of the judgment into the directory of sexual offen@@ ders .
locks switch to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up from the main point of view at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many tu@@ gs abandoned the people from fear of discovery and arrest .
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
along the River Flow Inn , more than 1000 refugees were taken up in the Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn County since Tuesday .
they were on foot through bridges and shr@@ ubs to the German side .
there they are received by federal police and forwar@@ ded to registration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Munich main station , after federal police data , there were once again significantly more refugees compared to the beginning of the week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by 8@@ am , some 700 people had arrived in the state capital , said a spokes@@ man in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , the city reached the city on Tuesday , 17@@ 59 .
Stuttgart : pione@@ ering of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the southwest
meteor@@ ologists war@@ n against storm o@@ aks in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , warm sea air flows into the country , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart was divided .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vigor@@ ous Deep is the prec@@ urs@@ or of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who was pulled over the Atlantic in recent days by the Bermuda Islands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent stor@@ ms and th@@ under@@ stor@@ ms are mainly expected in Baden .
according to D@@ WD , it is still possible to count on Thursday morning also in the Black Forest , on Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the ground @-@ seek@@ ers with Bö@@ en from 60 to 90 hour kilometres .
on Friday the sun can be seen again longer .
the mass makes it : every two years the motor@@ ways show their novel@@ ties at the I@@ AA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2015 is primarily a movement in the compact cars , which are currently particularly well sold . &quot; &quot; &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently particularly in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of the new registrations according to the German Federal Office ( KBA ) alone fell into this segment alone in August alone .
this is also reflected at the I@@ AA ( publication stage 17 to 27 September ) .
this year , many new compact models will be presented between all the fut@@ ur@@ istic concept vehicles and new luxury cars .
one of the biggest pre@@ mier@@ es for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra , which will be at deal@@ ers@@ hips in the fall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order to sell the volume model well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive .
Opel represents an entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf in the view that starts at 17 650 Euro .
the current Astra weighs 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is available with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse offer further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which the first time also includes three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines .
unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only available as five @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the com@@ bi , which can also be seen at the I@@ AA .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the I@@ AA in new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively available as a five @-@ door in a conventional and an acc@@ entu@@ ated sporty GT version .
in the trade he comes next year , then also as a com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 is completely new in the segment .
the Nissan de@@ posit@@ ory wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines fits perfectly into the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will get a gasoline engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 liter tur@@ bom@@ ot@@ or and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is 170 New@@ ton meters ( Nm ) according to manufacturer &apos;s declar@@ ations .
the sales launch of the bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not entirely new , but completely renewed is the compact car model DS 4 , which can be seen at the I@@ AA .
outside , the designers of the ed@@ len Citro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers presented their hand at the front end . here , the radiator grill was re@@ drawn and the changed flo@@ od@@ lights were equipped with LED technology .
especially the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was modernis@@ ed in the interior , reducing the number of buttons through a touch screen and integrated into Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play for the first time .
in addition , at the I@@ AA in the compact class , a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the refurb@@ ished Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I .
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are deser@@ ted
the Federal Constitutional Court has granted an ex @-@ prison@@ er of the prison sentence of Justice , which was lod@@ ged in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their dignity , prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are accommod@@ ated in small cells .
this decision has made the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision issued on Wednesday .
according to the judges , the judges can even hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in confin@@ ed spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 112@@ 7 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ in@@ mate with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was placed in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 , and the toilet was not separated spati@@ ally .
after that , the man , who , according to his lawyer , has meanwhile been rel@@ oc@@ ated to a larger cell .
his Administr@@ ative Court failed because of the un@@ worthy conditions of det@@ ention against the Land of Berlin .
but the Constitutional Court raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court and rejected the case for re @-@ examination .
they see the human dignity of man hurt .
chamber court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if , for legal reasons , only a few days of imprisonment for compensation were decisive , a balancing burden was given , it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear a cur@@ v@@ ature of the legal protection of the personality &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chamber court must now clarify the amount of monetary compensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Constitutional Court has often strengthened the rights of prisoners of prisoners in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus they spoke only in April of a prison@@ er damages , because he was naked in a cell .
according to a decision of 2011 , the multiple allocation of a cell without separate toilet is also deser@@ ted .
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had agreed a decent housing for a prison@@ er in a parallel fall in November 2009 .
the former pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff lasted for three months between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons had come to the head@@ lines due to lack of staff in the past few weeks .
prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even for fights , it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Judi@@ cial Office , 21 vac@@ ancies in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the lack of money , 19 shall fall away in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what comes to Germany ?
according to the Federal Ministry of Interior , some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany according to the Federal Ministry &apos;s predic@@ tions , according to the testimony of Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to include a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we create it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different forecasts between 35@@ 0,000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of State ) and 400@@ ,000 ( valu@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments annually - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space , however , is dramatic above all with affordable rental objects : every year 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social housing exp@@ ires from the rental price , and these particularly favorable apartments will also apply for refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the funding , at present 518 million to one billion euros .
too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing a year would have to arise and therefore the federal government would have to invest 6.6 billion euros per year .
at the same time , scientists and federal mini@@ stri@@ es agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investments in housing construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it is assumed that 55 % of the p@@ oul@@ try in Germany can be employed in the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked about their qualifications to help them get started cri@@ tici@@ zed Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial to find jobs in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the admission company , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , says Mig@@ r@@ ations@@ for@@ scher Dietrich Thr@@ ush@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany , according to Thr@@ ush@@ hardt there has been a political change : from the prohibition of employment for refugees to recognise work .
while there was previously a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers from up to five years , it was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the resi@@ den@@ cy obligation to limit asylum seek@@ ers to a place of residence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society - even because of the short@@ age of skilled workers - has mostly perme@@ ated the point of view that refugees should be able to gain access to the labour market more quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large barrier to access to the labour market is missing German knowledge .
up to now there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
research also shows that work@@ places are most often transmitted by personal contacts .
the development of networks is therefore , according to the opinion of Thr@@ ush@@ hardt , the Royal Road to Work Integration .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few w@@ ing@@ ed parents give their children to the k@@ ite , estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the ent@@ ang@@ ed parents it is very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ ś@@ bar , spokes@@ person for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
should the need for educ@@ ators increase sharp@@ ly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacity - for instance by allowing more professional schools .
students are prepared for lessons without German knowledge in the countries .
however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no lack of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ays from the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that approximately 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no Bundes@@ land asylum seek@@ ers or toler@@ ated the study - the only exception was to date Berlin , In@@ spec@@ tor Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) , but now abandoned his stance .
the admission to the university could be facilit@@ ated by student willing refugees .
because refugees with a residence reimb@@ urs@@ ement or debt don &apos;t get any services according to the asylum seek@@ ers &apos; performance law more if they start studying .
in general , the latter get no B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since it does not fall under the circle of the b@@ af@@ ög@@ ge persons .
toler@@ ated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be entitled to be B@@ af@@ ö@@ g @-@ justified , from 1 January 2016 onwards , this span is short@@ ened to 15 months .
but this financing gap needs to be closed , but Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should succ@@ essi@@ vely move the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ church law evol@@ ve into a new state @-@ religion relationship .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic Wel@@ fare Association , who professionally takes care of the new@@ com@@ ers .
rights are also duties .
thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be prepared to work with the state in many areas and to grant him some control possibilities .
this also includes the willingness to take heed to religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday , religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to conduct such conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ rische Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will continue to be a topic of the whole society in the future .
this will also have to change the majority society , pushing against discrimination and rac@@ ism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination authority and a general equality law for a decade now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it lear@@ ns very slowly how the NS@@ U series showed , in the police and authorities the rac@@ ist motive was systematically ignor@@ ing .
equal opportunities for all : what migrants organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white German have long demanded and why international agreements such as the anti @-@ rac@@ ism convention in Germany commit , must become a reality in the next few years , if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens should take advantage of their opportunities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the expected refugees , says Doctor Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for MAN@@ - power and capacities , we create it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must be incorporated into the system .
to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery ur@@ ges to susp@@ end all arri@@ vals at the registration of health cards .
services rendered could later be b@@ illed with the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in the long term it is highly question@@ able to send as many people with the limited power catalogue , which the asylum seek@@ ers act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise the doctors are doing the language barriers .
already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated , migrants are getting worse about their illnesses as other patients .
it requires interpre@@ ting fees not only in clinics , also in medical practices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , many refugees would have been helped with more general medical care@@ ers in emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and with another diagnostic look .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the refugee children there is much more un@@ fair han@@ di@@ caps , and with the young people it is about HIV @-@ education . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the partially other disease pictures , German doctors are coming from their training , but it is clear that Mont@@ gom@@ ery means .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite attacks or tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so hard to recognise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the lack of health , even alle@@ vi@@ ation in sight may be caused by the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed educational system , some refugees are even doctors .
in order to prac@@ tise , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill after estimates of the Federal Emis@@ sions Treatment C@@ ause ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most of them suffer from post@@ traum@@ atic stress disorder or depression .
especially vulnerable are refugee children , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recently published study by the TU München shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
those who are suffering from a post@@ traum@@ atic stress disorder suffer from the so @-@ called flash@@ backs with respiratory , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart @-@ rage and death .
further symptoms are sleep and concentration disorders , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
to prevent the symptoms chronic , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z declared .
however , only four percent of psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ologically ill seek@@ ers can place an application for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , the processing usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social offices , mostly non @-@ workers or doctors who are not trained for the mental illness , decide whether treatment is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new production &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of the cir@@ cus art . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to draw any age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst looks into the arena on the brick roads to dream .
&quot; our passion is cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and junior chef . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current stage of art . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more than 33 years cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
so the gift to am@@ ass@@ ment lies with the family in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take away people from their everyday people and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; empha@@ sizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ egen@@ cocktail mit Welt@@ stadt @-@ Flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as director Reinhard Pro@@ bst calls his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 kilometres long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus programme impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
awarded at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ ar@@ ov C@@ low@@ n Family attracted the audience with w@@ it and charm .
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent movies , it wants to easily record the Cub@@ an duo .
light@@ ness and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
her hum@@ orous art at the mast is supposed to conquer women &apos;s hearts in the storm .
apart from numerous Sal@@ mon Sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Circus Pro@@ bst is also fascinated by a sense of t@@ act and joy .
balance with the un@@ icycle on a ball ?
for He Yuan is no problem .
sn@@ ake people fascin@@ ate and fri@@ gh@@ ten at the same time .
Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little else and fascin@@ ates with her mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; empha@@ sizes Steph@@ an@@ ies Mutter , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are too often a topic of various animal welfare organizations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if our animals are not good , we don &apos;t go well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each pet@@ ting unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they are called aff@@ ection@@ ately will be read by the eyes whenever possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it does not want to go into the arena .
so the top commandment : good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ ro@@ id Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a Zeb@@ ra@@ st@@ ute , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals have lived together in a habitat for eight years and nothing is happening .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
the zeb@@ ro@@ id is not ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
so there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with their whole heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from September 17 to 20 , the Circus Pro@@ bst daily invites you to their performances at 5 p.m. and 8 p.m .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is a family day , for the performance at 5 pm the prices are reduced .
in addition , the animal show is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm .
Zimbabwe Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by claims by members of the opposition that they would have received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with bu@@ cks .
in the past month they had booked him and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ person for the movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to inter@@ fere with Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said journalists to Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it war@@ ns the Parliament members affected that the immun@@ ity in the parliament ends and as soon as they leave parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to build 25,@@ 000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP will later divide into two listed companies this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and service activities .
the expected job sh@@ red@@ ding leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP said in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who should lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we have a wide and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; is focused on delivering far @-@ reaching , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; such as an explanation of the company .
it spl@@ its a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in order to manufacture electro @-@ systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has under@@ gone massive restructuring in order to cope with the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this sector , based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide better performance .
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger emphas@@ ised Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September and if his rehabilitation proceeds according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already implies that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and in the face of his story , his involvement in the next summer is certainly still un@@ certain .
the big shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pres@@ e@@ ason .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kl@@ es or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger recognised , there is the associated risk of further injuries whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different disorders of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 Lig@@ asp@@ iel@@ en in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for Arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 that have recorded most of the vulner@@ ability .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but ar@@ sen@@ al believes that an improvement in the risk of injuries is ongoing during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a pr@@ one time period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win combat power , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome it .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
Arsen@@ al starts his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns a spin within the team .
Hé@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need it to give a little break @-@ off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favourites are to advance through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign started in the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , where 3,2 measured on the Richter scale .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope to lead the association to its first Europ@@ ap@@ ok@@ al triumph with its management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked with Arsen@@ al .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand , I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : com@@ edy @-@ Show , which gives us serious lessons on mens friendship
the lack of similar depic@@ tions in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now even more desperate than ever before , how su@@ icide rates among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it is three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , Camp@@ aig@@ n Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a pi@@ tiful life ) was announced as the year of the man with the aim of asking the men to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the cent@@ er@@ piece in the fight to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms proved that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a healthy mood , his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not depres@@ sive , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of communication led by social media , with its emphasis on style on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , vibrant and successful , even if in reality the isolation is dominated .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call extr@@ insi@@ c values ; money , image , social status , everything at the expense of intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy fortune .
the beauty of friends was that this focuss@@ ing was placed on the head .
each character has not been defined by his work , but through his personality , which sh@@ ines through interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments in the foot@@ stool in cozy chairs and the long@@ ing of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can refer to it anyway , even if they often hold back to explore completely their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a staff of teleph@@ ony past@@ oral care told me : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My list@@ ener role for people who feel de@@ pressed and endangered is really clear to me how even the smallest interaction of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when talking about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status about the phone to help people in moments of desp@@ air also may help the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so if you attend this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with which to celebrate the day completely re@@ designed setting , why don &apos;t you take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you see someone sitting alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say h@@ ello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 236 epis@@ odes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria arrives to help PSG to break up Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
at his debut in the Champions League , di Maria arrives on Tuesday and helps PSG to pass by Malm@@ ö .
here are the game reports and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani took course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria found out less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PSG @-@ Player , who brought the French master on his way , but after that she missed a number of occasions before she finally climb@@ ed her lead when Cav@@ ani climb@@ ed a head ball@@ tor in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ets@@ k also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish master , since they do not only seek the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quad@@ rant fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a class game by Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later changed in the game against his home town team and against the association with which he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause problems and look back relaxed even if there are certain things that we have to perfection during the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team after his injury , which ended on the weekend a 2 : 2 draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the first le@@ ague , but he was cut out in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ inian wing @-@ storm was referred to as the man who took PSG to the next stage in Europe , when he was taken over the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed out why , when he was running in Marco Ver@@ rat &apos;s pass behind the Malm@@ ö @-@ defense , before he passed Johan Wil@@ and finished beautiful into the long corner of the network .
but if someone thought that PSG would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , which hit the Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , played with nine national players on the field and was ag@@ it@@ ated by a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field , a serious opponent .
but besides a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic who passed far to Kevin Tr@@ apps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 34@@ th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PSG himself sometimes gave up , with some mis@@ carri@@ ages and bad degrees , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was scrat@@ ched in the first half alone in the first half alone and then abandoned after the re@@ boot .
nevertheless , he instruc@@ ted a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shot , which was lo@@ wered by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the pole ...
the second goal was finally shortly after the hours stamp thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an scor@@ ed his sixth sa@@ is@@ ont@@ or after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back into play , and only an excellent intervention by Wil@@ and from the short@@ est distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the final result low before replacement player E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi became a gate at the end .
the trainer of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PSG was a class above his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish League , which has not the same level .
the qualifying matches are not enough . &quot;
hat@@ s off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 Change to the FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern occurred a few years ago shortly before the Com@@ mit@@ ment of Spain &apos;s Super@@ star X@@ avi who played for FC Barcelona at that time .
eight times Spanish champion , three times cup winner , four times Champions League winner , twice champion champion , twice champion champion , twice champion champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left the FC Barcelona after 24 years and changed to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca X@@ avi now reveals that he stood before the departure from Barcelona before the A@@ EM 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Madrid then won everything , we have nothing , &quot; he tells .
and that also registered the FC Bayern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ avi : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rum@@ mage wanted me to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in summer 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
guar@@ di@@ ans was the reason that X@@ avi not changed
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this is working today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ avi says why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has contrac@@ ted Guardi@@ ola and I played a great EM . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 had run with X@@ avi .
X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn , out@@ dated the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and at the end pre@@ mier@@ ed the King &apos;s Triumph .
matt Dam@@ on plays a variety in film creation
matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the African film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the variety and said she would not need behind the scenes .
during a succession of Sunday night by H@@ B@@ OS Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown under@@ lined the need for alternative perspectives , with reference to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the occupation of the film and not in the occupation of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
brown re@@ acted sho@@ cked , with offensive dis@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! w@@ ow . okay , &quot; as the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian soli@@ di@@ fied .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to ask people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - how to treat the character of Harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown initially . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a N@@ ut@@ te beaten by her white col@@ der .
the producer of De@@ ar White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for direc@@ ting rights to the film ; Dam@@ on said their direction &quot; in the end could give us something we do not want . &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ ons &apos;s comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter User Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip by writing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; talks about the only black person in the room so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO WHITE that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 Ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its release .
Dam@@ ons &apos;s comments come at a time when precise r@@ acial representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved nation@@ wide action and urged leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to command discrimin@@ atory practices against color restra@@ int .
in February the singer Prince gave a recording to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; albums still matter , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
in more recent times , leaders of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter released an explanation and , in response to the question of the Fox news personality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of entert@@ ainers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ ts who are invited to visit the Pope in order to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope , is un@@ clear .
&apos;@@ American Ninja War@@ rior &apos; crow@@ ned 1st Champion
professional sports clim@@ bers and control aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first ath@@ l@@ ete who won the American Ninja War@@ rior on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which just completed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant which could finish all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and Kamer@@ am@@ ann Ge@@ off Br@@ itten , to the final .
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Br@@ itten completed the task within the time with which he was the first ath@@ l@@ ete who finished the exhau@@ sting Phase 4 of American Ninja War@@ rior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds , making him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke to E ! News following the hard @-@ fought victory , still under shock to win the Grand Prix of 1 million $ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than 10,000 $ or had to live , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his pile of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so very suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how it is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Rep@@ orter to discuss the final and why Br@@ itten , although he first finished the course , won &apos;t receive any prize money .
after the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are more than one fin@@ alist there will be the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and changing life , he receives the great gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he got any gru@@ dge above that .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received crowds of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad that Isaac is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac could have felt just as if they had de@@ pl@@ eted the roles .
America Ninja War@@ rior has been extended for an eighth season , the fil@@ ming will begin in spring 2016 .
Det@@ roit tiger loops to Minn@@ es@@ ota Tw@@ ins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ LI@@ S@@ --@@ the second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Det@@ roit tiger .
in the past , they were one of the best teams in the bas@@ eb@@ all , today the Tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minn@@ es@@ ota Tw@@ ins with 5 @-@ 4 in the Target Field .
the Tw@@ ins w@@ asted a chance to climb up within one half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League game card .
for Det@@ roit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so hard to summar@@ ize over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all wins do fun no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support when Det@@ roit scor@@ ed three times in the first two Inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings for 6 times and made three rounds .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to finish this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw each game in the bul@@ l@@ pen , and so I want to go into the game completely .
the designer @-@ designed tiger @-@ h@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first race since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ star hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle Marine on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has cur@@ tail@@ ed the punch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said E@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( punch training ) , looked much better in the bul@@ l@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the background at the end of the seventh inning the Tw@@ ins had their best chance to come back into the game again .
center FI@@ EL@@ DER B@@ yr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right FI@@ EL@@ DER Aaron H@@ icks reached a B@@ unt , and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out , before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy passed down wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the nomin@@ ee R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ Schlag@@ mann Miguel S@@ ano , who caught a Two @-@ Run in front of the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the closing @-@ run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was this in the major le@@ ague for the 27th time this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe has hit a double play
after Det@@ roit , at the end of the ninth inning , added a Insurance @-@ Run , the wall created a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ h@@ anders , however , st@@ ole S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for his fifth &quot; Save . &quot;
Det@@ roit prof@@ ited the start of the game from an unprecedented Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers scor@@ ed three of us in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been canc@@ eled before the game from the injury list after he was missing more than a month because of a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I had wished for , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off bat@@ ter , H@@ ushes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J@@ .D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into play , creating a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 success story with the runners in scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right side , creating another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third that the threat ended .
the Tig@@ ers placed in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out single from Center @-@ FI@@ EL@@ DER Anthony G@@ ose to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a big blow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tw@@ ins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not beat well , but he caught the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ Count , scor@@ ed no points in the third inning before being replaced by the Rel@@ ie@@ ver right handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns on six hits and one walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ chez eliminated because of a violation of the throwing shoulder .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the Sh@@ oul@@ der of San@@ chez in 2007 .
San@@ chez , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list due to a shoulder t@@ apping , should be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ chez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is cancelled from the vulner@@ ability list to start against the Tw@@ ins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30th July
he has been missing in the right hip joint since the 20th of August .

hundreds of refugees shall perish in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the persons involved in it are then to be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , such as the City of Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening .
they reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the H@@ ess@@ ische Landes@@ hauptstadt have been prepared in the past few days .
up to 1,000 refugees can temporarily perish .
they will then be distributed to other municipalities .
in the past ten days alone , the government pres@@ idency of G@@ ießen took over 7,@@ 500 people in H@@ esse in the last ten days .
due to the large number of refugees , Frankfurt and Han@@ au also have Emer@@ gency shel@@ ters in sports halls .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the decisive re@@ thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he presented the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective far@@ ewell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was happy that the ch@@ ali@@ ce of a military participation in Germany has passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends in front of our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deut@@ schland@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase of international assistance to refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria again established controls on its southern and eastern borders .
Austrian Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said on Tuesday evening in Austrian TV station ORF , after Hungary nobody will be sent back .
also Germany sent no refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , this is so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement , after which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l Leit@@ ner said , there have already been discussions between the Director General for Public Safety and representatives of Germany .
she did not call concrete figures and pointed to discussions on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria on the so @-@ called Bal@@ kan@@ route from Hungary .
your goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann , together with several other EU heads of state and government , requested a special summit for next week .
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not yet been able to agree on a common approach to the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU interior ministers intend to take a new start to the binding distribution of further 120 000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) on Tuesday ( 22 September ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the strong refugee flow in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the first recording and distribution of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consult@@ ations with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lined , those people who needed shelter conf@@ ess this too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but those who don &apos;t have a lead perspective can &apos;t stay in Germany either . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this view had been clearly divided into the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ch@@ anc@@ ellor stressed , the state as a whole must now face a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary had closed its 175 @-@ kilomet@@ re @-@ long border with Serbia at night on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few hours later the Budapest government announced that the border with Romania must also be brid@@ ged with a fence .
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wants to prevent tu@@ gs from ev@@ asion about Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government promptly condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Turkey , the number of ey@@ e@@ witnesses reported that thousands of migrants went on their way to the Greek border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sp@@ azi@@ de &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the ice cream of the Satur@@ n@@ moon En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean sw@@ aps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly , the moon is easily stag@@ gering on its way around the ring planets .
although this movement is only small , but still too big for a continuous solid cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a communication from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) from Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers present their analyses in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even longer it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice blank@@ et of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already discovered ic@@ vul@@ can@@ oes in the South Pole of the Satur@@ n@@ moon in 2006 , sp@@ as@@ ps water vap@@ or and ice particles , thus feeding the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ Ring of Saturn &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the South Pole , there must be a sub@@ terran@@ ean sea , the astronom@@ ers closed back then .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear .
R@@ ama missing 1860 München several weeks
the 1860 München must ren@@ ounce about one month to the off@@ ender Val@@ det R@@ ama .
an examination carried out an ad@@ du@@ tive injury to the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association shared .
R@@ ama had already compl@@ ained about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Munich lion the diagnosis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; probably four weeks of forced break &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; forced break &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is difficult for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ edi@@ t@@ ary loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we must think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sporting director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper looking at the potential commitment of a united professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a training guest , the six@@ ties however first presented a def@@ ensive man .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was previously under contract with the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at is currently &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the possibility to demonstrate his ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

no Di@@ et Fruit - Man@@ gan@@ ese contain a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
man@@ goes contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ cro@@ se .
the exotic fruits are healthy nonetheless : there are B vitamins in them as well as vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ goes include a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ urs@@ or beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits are thus supporting tend@@ on , immune system and met@@ abolic processes in the body .
when buying man@@ go , man@@ go should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant .
the colour alone says nothing about how ri@@ pe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and be consumed within a few days .
then they taste of course pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives sav@@ ory dishes a special touch .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf sal@@ ads such as ch@@ ic@@ ory and radi@@ c@@ cio .
and a man@@ go @-@ ney fits well with fish , p@@ oul@@ try , lamb and ven@@ ison .
the US par@@ cel service U@@ PS places up to 95@@ 0,000 aid for the Christmas business in the USA .

first con@@ cili@@ atory storm , then marked cold front
the next night falls in the valleys of the Alps of the F@@ öh@@ n , like Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday the F@@ öh@@ n b@@ lows with storm strength through the com@@ promis@@ ers .
on Thursday morning we cross a marked cold front , which brings strong ra@@ inf@@ all , wind @-@ bu@@ cks and a temperature decline .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest @-@ current .
on the side of the Alps it breaks through the valleys in the night on Wednesday of the F@@ öh@@ n .
in the episode , the F@@ öh@@ n b@@ lows in the con@@ cili@@ ties with Bö@@ en from 60 to 100 km / h , occasionally , and partly also in the Ur@@ i country with more than 100 km / h .
the F@@ öh@@ n is able to penet@@ rate to the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and and on the mountains even organs @-@ bu@@ cks of more than 120 km / h are possible .
while in the north on Wednesday , stor@@ my fo@@ eh@@ ouses rises for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to be st@@ owed at the end of the Alps .
here rain begins , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , the Alps south of the Alps have to be reck@@ oned with over 100 litres of rain per square meter in the next 48 hours , this has already fallen into large ra@@ inf@@ all over the last few days .
on Thursday morning , the blow comes out of the air , in which a cold front rolls with powerful , partly swe@@ at@@ y rain from west to east over Switzerland .
together with the cold front the wind is blowing strongly until stor@@ my , and the temperatures go far back .
the following days show up in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , on weekends it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome .
in the presence of Stadt@@ prä@@ sident Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a previously nam@@ eless square in the park was christ@@ ened on the Opp@@ io Hill on the name of the German Re@@ formers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he is now known as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the ancient Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working community of the Protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
on Wednesday , Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , priest of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran congregation in Rome , reminded that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often live their faith only in sec@@ l@@ usion .
with the place I become visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he received the city back then as a comm@@ ent@@ able sin @-@ b@@ abel .
his negative impressions were encouraged by histori@@ ans in his later fight against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the split of the ab@@ end@@ otic church with his th@@ eses against Ab@@ las@@ sh@@ andel .
hammer artist spent three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold plated ) crown is one of the master@@ pieces that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated biblical texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with splendid images .
in the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who in 150 motifs formulated his very personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has preserved the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is by no means equivalent to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , it can be quite dark .
&quot; &quot; &quot; about three years , Ot@@ mar has worked in his bi@@ ble project for which he made a subj@@ ectively @-@ artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Book of all Books &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are cycles that focus on topics such as cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or pat@@ ernity .
he immediately fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its emphasis on art books .
and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the scrip@@ tures chosen by Ot@@ mar Alt and thus translated into current contex@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verb@@ al mirrors of painting .
they are embedded between the original text of Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who formulated his very personal thoughts about the situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
thus the 75 year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately tri@@ ggers for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and raised in Berlin , comes from a family who belonged to the strict Protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ h@@ uter @-@ Orden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; education has already happened to the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt re@@ members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to re@@ vise this , in order to be able to get me again with the Lord &apos;s Father again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to bring art to more importance in a fast @-@ moving time : &quot; today &apos;s perception of visual worlds is shaped by advertising , and it is loud .
symboli@@ sm is being displac@@ ed .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
images always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the spec@@ t@@ ator go into the pictures &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; discover and feel the strength they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture is looking for its opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was present on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation &apos;s presentation in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
old I have not paid attention to fully compreh@@ ending the Bible , but chosen for him important , also mysterious subjects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was not a cooperation at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is about the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for Mö@@ h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung on November 15 .
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn close
plans made , space found , companies commissioned to model earth hills for a circuit : one year later , almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X @-@ Bahn was finally finished .
fail@@ ures in politics and administration ensured envel@@ op@@ ing , especially among the residents who did not want to toler@@ ate the railway .
so hill sec@@ lu@@ ded , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval will enter in October , the first municipal coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck could now communicate in the children &apos;s and youth affairs committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then it should be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further pause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees until 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga posts a clear sign on the weekend .
the aim is to gather information on the quality and variety of what IAB offers , on comprehensi@@ bility , motivation for use , and new user requirements , with a view to improving IAB &apos;s web presence even further .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider this for the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there can be no one in principle , that &apos;s not about me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be interested in getting a grip on this subject , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Nier@@ sbach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel , on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the situation of refugees in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am next Wednesday in the Federal Chanc@@ ellery and meet there the Minister of State Mrs Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue will surely play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and wants to help .
but the decisive course has to place politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore the German Football Association has expanded its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Stiftung , we ensured that this programme continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Nier@@ sbach at the edge of the UEF@@ A @-@ Tagung in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some federal li@@ sts also support this program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on this weekend , the 36 professional clubs set a clear sign when they will carry the printing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of the usual sponsor logo ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also want to make clear that everyone should help where and how they can only , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s sports manager Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trag@@ ic drama goes to everyone , nobody can &apos;t see it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can make football states , no , we have to use our radi@@ ance , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hertha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the le@@ ague . &quot;
for the EM @-@ qualifying play against Hungary this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ sbach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large community of German football &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 licenses have started their own projects in their places is great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and the next year , the association will work together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government for 300@@ ,000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nier@@ sbach . &quot; &quot; &quot;

but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could do his job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is busy at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully labour @-@ capable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SZ &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the US , but since the summer it was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such personal history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SZ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can do something like that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up once you &apos;ve fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ Re@@ placement Magn@@ us@@ sen out of skir@@ mish ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ tered a picture and explained that he suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

football : B@@ VB ohne Re@@ us gegen Kras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller im Tor
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us have finally cr@@ ushed defini@@ tively in the first group game of the Europa League .
the national player will also be ab@@ sent to the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in the Du@@ el with the FK Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot resort to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spin against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ VB @-@ Coach accepted : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high load on his pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change his position on the Re@@ us position .
thus he announced a change on the por@@ ter &apos;s position .
that &apos;s why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is taking the place of Stamm@@ ler Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trained on an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion .
however , if the future in the future will be used in all Europa League games , Tu@@ ch@@ el left open .
with high probability he will also contest the second game .
the for@@ ge statement by fellow players Re@@ us that the final suit for the B@@ VB in the Europa League must be the goal , holds middle @-@ field player Julian W@@ eig@@ l for comprehensi@@ ble : &quot; so Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to access the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Robot@@ er@@ cars : government wants a pione@@ ering role in Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany should be a technological pioneer in changing the car after the German government &apos;s will . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Autom@@ esse I@@ AA from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility era . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic , Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said .
he wants to discuss the issue with his counter@@ parts from the G@@ 7 states , which come together with representatives from the industry at the International Motor Show .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport empha@@ sizes among other things the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid conversion to digital radio .
for testing new technology , a test track is currently being developed on the motorway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the rider to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional risks of liability &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the German government wants to review the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use internationally for the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / km .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only seen people as a driver . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with automated driving , the car takes over the lead , the driver becomes more and more passenger .
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving will be technically feasible for motor@@ ways by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless traffic @-@ free vehicles on public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be expected after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the Germany location estimate the authors of the study by 2025 to around € 8.4 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the passenger can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road transport , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD traffic politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied .
however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still see more scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday at the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the test organisation Dek@@ ra is the result that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will be en@@ forced over the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect at all in 20 years , 31 percent believe not at all .
Euromonitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems .
drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of the digital network Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control throughout the entire trip on all roads .
on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could at least imagine 15 percent , in St@@ au 45 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ oll says team and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
according to the current status of the title , the Düsseldorf branch will only strike in sing@@ les from 25 September to 4 October .
the final decision shall be at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said German trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the EM Training in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ oll was at that time on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor@@ ship date in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German master will be back on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo &apos;s the dis@@ advantage , we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Ein@@ zel @-@ Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ enstein in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also rec@@ alled the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then Timo was also missing , and we became European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what we should ori@@ ent ourselves &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained the World Ran@@ king Fi@@ fth . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant ...
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich on Wednesday .
the highlights : DISPLAY MANNEQUINS , which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video proj@@ ections .
they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant of Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier it was ble@@ ak , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( Vom Stadt stei@@ g auf den Lauf@@ ste@@ g ) , die vom 18 . September an in der Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an exhibition so@@ unded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly ever @-@ looking work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprentic@@ eship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ographer total artwork for which much effort was done : to refres@@ h the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was hired .
14 tons of material have lost the mo@@ vers according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special delic@@ acy : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .
Heidi meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even Gau@@ l@@ tiers of old Teddy is shown in the exhibition .
it stands for the first , lively fashionable ham@@ lets of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he dressed up his Teddy B@@ H@@ s and dresses , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him .
he later taught the dem@@ ise of fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , such as Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought them , but of course .
he didn &apos;t have to pay the models for his first own fashion show .
they got nothing , but were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery statt Gard@@ ine - Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze as Mode @-@ N@@ ic
earlier it went to the long embroi@@ der@@ y machines in and around Pl@@ auen to make some meters .
the embroi@@ dered materials and sp@@ ik@@ es were produced in large quantities for customers , which they processed for example for blank@@ ets and she@@ ers .
this is no longer working today , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , CEO of the Mo@@ unting Pl@@ auen .
instead the fashion is important again .
in the early times of the Pl@@ auen point fashion plays a major role , was then pushed by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , in accessories like bags and for regional costumes .
anyway , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past styli@@ stic periods , is an increasing order potential .
those who do not use niche in the textile branch in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they are doing half of all orders .
with nine other companies , Mo@@ unting Pl@@ auen is a member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and Sti@@ cker@@ eien .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
in the last 15 years , around 80 percent of the turnover has been cut off .
private specialty shops and wholesale stores are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
today , mass @-@ ware is made much cheaper in the Asian region and is distributed almost exclusively via chains .
furthermore , the export , currently , to Russia and the USA .
so enough reasons for new paths .
the industry association also aims to focus on environmental awareness , such as Cord@@ ula Bauer from the Stick@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; we have been leading a quality seal since this year , which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt also adds : &quot; this refers to the materials used . &quot;
master designer U@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the Schne@@ eber@@ ger Extr@@ enst@@ elle of the University of Applied Sciences Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ alizes in embroi@@ der@@ ies and sp@@ ik@@ es .
in order to counter@@ act competition from the Asian region , you need to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the companies that need to think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why an existing design is often only slightly different to keep a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter revi@@ ved the historical snow@@ ball tip .
in doing so , the machine sti@@ cking small spheres at some places .
the Pl@@ au@@ ener gold@@ smith &apos;s master Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ ße was inspired by it : &quot; before , I could not do anything with a traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener tip . &quot;
now she uses the snow ball tip for her jewelry .
in a complex procedure , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Pl@@ auen and surroundings and who would like to have a sou@@ venir .
I see my jewelry as modern ambassador of the Pl@@ auen point .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
legends are not to be touched , but Disney is still vent@@ uring into a new movie of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
according to Entertainment Week@@ ly , however , it &apos;s not about a re @-@ film , but a kind of sequ@@ el that plays 20 years after the first film with the magic child girl .
it is about the experience of N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the global economic crisis in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins for more than 50 years after Julie Andre@@ ws is still un@@ clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the director is already firm : Rob Marshall , most recently with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ to the Woods &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the cinema . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI aims to open the economy wider for the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy needs to open broad out@@ wards to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday a group that was commissioned to steering the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should be committed to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and to improve strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Command Group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to promote new start @-@ ups and drive reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Xi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list on the regulation of market access , relaxation of border control policies , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the local regulatory system .
after the statement , a negative list is created , the sectors and companies that do not come into question for investments .
the system is gradually being tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance as it as@@ signs the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , ensuring a legal business environment and stream@@ lining the market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen inspec@@ tions on the powers transferred to the companies and make sure companies decide how to conduct their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic co @-@ operation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
in the context of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment are opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , foreigners are made easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; Green Card &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process .
the right to guarantee lawyers to exercise their activities , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
the meeting also attended by Prime Minister Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Yun@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as reported in a statement issued after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury mar@@ ginal value in pre@@ dat@@ ors
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ors and therefore to give consumers a significantly higher dose of the nervous system .
the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , which is a corresponding working paper from the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full force of pregnant and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limits of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ - or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish are to be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish at the end of the food chain .
big pre@@ dat@@ ors , however , are already so heavily loaded with mercury that , on the basis of the still valid limit values , about 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ sal@@ able .
in return for this e@@ asing , the EU wants to shar@@ pen the limit values in other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram according to F@@ ood@@ watch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ood@@ watch referred to this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because smaller c@@ rank @-@ fish , such as car@@ p , are usually so low @-@ loaded that they already hold the planned maximum values today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ elden is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ ant distr@@ action man@@ oeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal that is highly poison@@ ous for the human being , largely enrich@@ ing over the food chain mainly in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore war@@ ns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; low amounts may be caused particularly in un@@ born damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Ministry of Environment explains on his homepage with regard to the maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health haz@@ ard of the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury passes primarily through coal combustion to the environment .
according to a written information from the German Federal Ministry of Environment , German coal @-@ fired power stations viol@@ ate more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total quantity in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long @-@ lasting and over@@ crowded &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted in March from paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide war@@ nings against mercury in fish already counted among the most common health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
