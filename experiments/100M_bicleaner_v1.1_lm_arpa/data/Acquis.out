the Community and the States are entitled to request that any questions arising out of the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be examined by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the state concerned to participate in the discussion of such issues through the Council .
with the exception of disputes arising from an assessment of the Council in accordance with Article 19 or a decision taken by the Council , disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be resolved on the request of a party of arbit@@ ration , consisting of five arbitr@@ ators .
the Community and the states design@@ ate two arbitr@@ ators , the organization also names two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators appointed arbitr@@ ators shall elect a fifth which will lead the pres@@ idency .
if the Community and the States or the Organization have not named two arbitr@@ ators within thirty days of the request for an Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal , the Community or the Organization may seek the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint the arbitr@@ ators .
the same procedure shall apply if the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected within thirty days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court are competent and all decisions require the consent of at least three arbitr@@ ators .
the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are binding for the organisation , the community and the States concerned .
a ) This Convention enters into force for non @-@ nuclear weapons , the contracting party of the contract and members of the association , in force , i ) if the respective state of the organization noti@@ fies that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this Convention , and
II . if the community of the Organization is notified that it is able to apply its security measures in relation to this state for the purposes of this Convention .
a ) The Organization , the Community and the States consult each other upon request from one of the contracting parties to am@@ end this Convention .
B ) All changes require the consent of the Organization , the Community and the States .
C ) The Director General shall immediately inform all Member States of the Organization of any modification of this Convention .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this Convention is the Convention and the Protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures to be applied in the implementation of the provisions of Part I concerning preventive measures .
the aim of the procedures set out in this Convention is the timely discovery of the junc@@ tions of significant amounts of nuclear material from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear war@@ ps for unknown purposes as well as the deter@@ r@@ ence of such a branch by the risk of early discovery .
in order to enrich the target set out in Article 28 , the material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , together with spatial integration and monitoring as important supplementary measures .
the technical conclusion of the inspections by the organisation is carried out by an explanation in which the quantity of material not proven for a given period of time is specified under specification of the accuracy limits for the given me@@ gen .
in carrying out its inspections , the Organization makes full use of the community &apos;s safety system in accordance with Article 3 .
the carrying and control system of the Community for Nu@@ clear Materials in accordance with this Convention is based on an arrangement in material bil@@ let zones .
in applying their security measures , the Community shall make use of de procedures and measures of the following nature and , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee as they are specified in the supplementary agreements and are practical :
a ) a measuring system for the determination of the quantities of preserved , trans@@ verse , lost , lost or otherwise removed from the stock and the stock quantities ;
B ) the evaluation of reproduci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
C ) method for determining , testing and evaluating differences in the measurements of transm@@ it@@ ters and recipients ;
e ) procedures for ass@@ essing the accumulation of non @-@ measured hol@@ dings and not measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and report system that identifies the core material inventory and the changes in this stock , including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone for each material balance zone ;
( g ) precau@@ tions that ensure that the accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) reimbur@@ sement of reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures under this agreement do not extend to material in mining or ore treatment .
B ) If the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under letter c ) is not yet reached , the Community of the Organization will inform the quantity and composition of the material provided that it is not introduced for specifically non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaves nuclear material suitable for the composition and purity for the fuel production or the supply of is@@ ot@@ opes , the plant or the process phase in which it is manufactured , or if this core material or other core material produced at a later stage of the nuclear fuel cycle is introduced into the states , it is subject to the other safety measures described in this Convention .
a ) The securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention are terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . however , the Community believes that the recovery of nuclear material , which is subject to the provisions under this agreement , is not possible or desirable from residues , the organization and the community consult each other about the application of appropriate securing measures .
B ) The securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention will be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the Community are percep@@ tible that this core material is practically non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able .
at the request of the Community , the Organization shall release the following core material from the securing measures in accordance with this agreement :
a ) special fis@@ sile material when used in gram - or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) Nu@@ clear material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 , if such material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % .
at the request of the Community , the Organization fre@@ es core material which would otherwise be subject to security measures under this Convention , from these safegu@@ ards , if the total material quantity delivered by the States in the States no longer amounts to than
a ) a total of one kilogram of special p@@ aging material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with a forti@@ fication of 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multi@@ pl@@ ying his weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with a forti@@ fication , which is below 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ an@@ ium , calcul@@ ates by multi@@ pl@@ ying his weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ an@@ ium and depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with a forti@@ fication of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) 20 metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with a forti@@ fication of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if free core material is to be processed or stored together with core material , which is subject to the securing measures in accordance with this Convention , precau@@ tions for re@@ use of the securing measures are met on that material .
the Community applies with the Organization of supplementary agreements , which are to the extent necessary for the successful and effective provision of the tasks of the Organization under this Convention , in the individual as to how to apply the procedures laid down in the Convention .
the supplementary agreements can be extended or amended without changing the agreement in agreement between the Organization and the Community .
the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the organization , the community and the states undertake all efforts to make these agreements come into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states .
on the basis of the initial report cited in Article 62 , the organization sets up a summari@@ zed inventory of the entire core material in the states , irrespective of its origin , and carries out this inventory directory on the basis of the following reports and the results of their investigations .
between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , the Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , the United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( organization ) on the other
the EW@@ G has decided to contribute to the special action programme set out at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low in@@ comes , whose development is ham@@ pered by common resource transfer problems .
C ) The aim of the EEC and the Member States is that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months of the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible is spent within two years after the entry into force in the form of loans , and the organisation will do its best to achieve this goal .
D ) The EEC and the organisation have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bonds in order to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
to this end , the Organization of the EEC has presented a table , which is intended to determine in which way it intends to apply the criteria set forth in this agreement -
the organization arran@@ ges a special account under the name &quot; special transactions account &quot; which consists of the funds that the Member States are governed and used in accordance with this agreement in accordance with this Agreement ; this account is referred to as &quot; Administrator &quot; by the Organization , only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement .
the special transaction accounts are led separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest deb@@ tors of the Member State , which are to be paid upon request in the currency of the respective state to order the organization as administrator of the special transactions account and to deposit at the office of the organization in the country concerned .
B ) the payment is made in two inst@@ al@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 BG@@ N . the contribution within 30 days of entering into force of this agreement or any other between the EEC and the Administrator date ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remainder of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or another time agreed between the EEC and the Administrator , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) Any Member State may , upon request , make payments to the above mentioned dead@@ lines .
according to the usual procedure of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker takes approximately proportional draw on the cash or the school @-@ j@@ ones to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and to balance the special transactions account in an appropriate manner .
in the case of granting these loans , the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC :
III ) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
( VI ) the composition and tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further lending capacity to loan terms without discount ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
each special transaction loan is used to finance a clearly re@@ turn@@ able development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral plan ) , regardless of whether it is part of the organisation &apos;s loan programme or not , according to the procedures and practices considered for the development credits financed by the Organization , which is to be considered under letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement .
the funds of the special transactions account may not be used instead of the Bank &apos;s International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or organization which is bound within the framework of a loan or credit for a program or project which has already been approved by directors of the Bank or the Organisation on the date of the entry into force of this agreement .
apart from Section 4 , special transactions are subject to the same re@@ payment terms that apply to the loan granted to the organization in general ; therefore , they are ref@@ und@@ able in 50 years for ten years .
special transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts for payment of this bi@@ b are to be made directly to the organization that retains them .
each special loan is to be indicated by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in particular the origin of the funds is stated .
the proceeds from each transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services established or furnished in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , which may be members of the organization and may be recipients of a loan granted at the time of the loan granted .
the capital re@@ payments of a special transaction loan are made to the special transaction account , and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state shall be returned to the Member State after its receipt as soon as possible from the administrator .
the Administrator informs the EEC about the plans and programmes approved by the directors for the audit by the directors in preparation and through the intentions and programmes approved by the directors .
during the time of payment of the special loans , the Administrator informs the EEC quar@@ terly on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenses made for this .
the car@@ et@@ aker transm@@ its the EEC as soon as possible after the conclusion of the financial year of the organization a detailed statement of the special transactions account with an opinion of the external audi@@ tors of the organization to this account statement .
after a full payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator of the EEC conve@@ ys a detailed report on the projects and programmes financed by the special transaction account .
the administrator creates and exec@@ utes appropriate records and invoices from which the contributions to the special transaction account , the amounts paid out of the account recei@@ pts and the amounts paid out of the account and the re@@ payments to the Member States are visible .
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ akers work closely together to achieve the aims of this agreement .
to this end , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker until the complete edition of the means of the special transaction account will exchange ideas about the status of the special transaction account , the progress of programmes or projects financed by special transactions and about any other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement has not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , which the EEC and the organisation may agree upon , the agreement and all obligations arising there@@ from are due to immediate effect .
if the total amount of capital received by the recipients is rep@@ aid in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all obligations of the parties resulting there@@ from are terminated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the EEC as per the proced@@ ural rules of each party .
the Govern@@ ments of the Member States noted the conclusion of the proceedings in question to the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities .
the General Sec@@ retariat for@@ wards these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication of the Reg@@ ular approval of this Agreement by the EEC to the Organization .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the mentioned notification in the organization .
this agreement is written in two signatures in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , and each word is equally binding .
whereas the agreement in the form of an amend@@ ment to the amend@@ ment to the Annex A of Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is to be concluded , HA@@ T has issued the following provisions :

in addition , in order to simplify the procedure for the adjustment of tari@@ ff @-@ tari@@ ff terms in the case of further changes to the tari@@ ff tari@@ ff of one of the contracting parties in the future , it appears further indicated to include an article 12 to the agreement .
I honor you to confirm the consent of the Community to these changes and suggest you as an appointment for the entry into force 1 January 1978 .
I would be grateful if you would confirm me with the consent of your government to the foreg@@ o@@ ing .
I honor you to confirm the receipt of your current letter with the following wording :
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would confirm me with the consent of your government to the foreg@@ o@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a letter exchange between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobili@@ sation of the Member States &apos; demands in the context of the medium @-@ term financial support
the BI@@ S could close stand@@ by loan agreements with the central banks of credi@@ tor countries when banks make a corresponding application .
the agreement could be concluded up to the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor country to the Mechan@@ ism , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future deployment opportunities in the member countries .
however , some conditions are mentioned below for which the BI@@ S would be ready for its application .
in each stand @-@ by credit the BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ ables , without the fact that a total of five years will be exceeded .
at the opening of the loans as well as with their event@@ ual extension , the BI@@ S would charge a credit opening commission .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first draw will not be made before the end of a month after the end of the Stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the draw would take place in the currencies available in the BI@@ S at the conclusion of the agreement , very likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods that would be negotiated under consideration of the means of the bank , probably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those who use the BI@@ Z at the time of business carried out under similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would largely correspond to the market rates .
if the BI@@ S has to proc@@ ure the necessary funds itself on the market , then the interest rate for the application could reach a maximum equivalent to the Li@@ bor for the corresponding margin .
I would be grateful if you would give me the consent of the Council of the European Communities .

- frozen h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( tari@@ ff of tari@@ ff 02.@@ 01 A IV b ) of the Common Cust@@ oms Tari@@ ff ) .
as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay after the community are set at the following annual amount :
in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Uruguay , through suitable procedures , is obliged to ensure that the actual annual quantity does not exceed the agreed amount and is carried out according to conventional supply forms ( frozen or ch@@ illed ) .
should a change in the offer form be possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement consult each other prior to introducing such a change in the committee mentioned under # 10 in order to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the community takes the protection clause , it under@@ takes to ensure that the Urugu@@ ay@@ an access regulated under this agreement is not affected by the Community market .
in the event that imports from Uruguay exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Uruguay for the rest of the year .
the Community ple@@ dges to limit the exhaus@@ tion to the imports of products acquired by this agreement to a ho@@ d rate of 10 BC .
in the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Uruguay changes the amount set under number 2 corresponding to the scope of Urugu@@ ay@@ an trade with each new Member State .
the import duties for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this will be taken into account under the number 5 of the above mentioned ho@@ ur@@ ly rate of exhaus@@ tion .
the total quantity referred to as number 2 is set at the day of the accession of Greece to the community on 5 800 tons of car@@ c@@ ass weight .
the community under@@ takes everything to prevent market development , which could imp@@ air the marketing of Urugu@@ ay@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat in the community market within the agreed quantities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the Community meets precau@@ tions so that the sales of inter@@ vention@@ ist stocks of frozen meat are not under@@ min@@ ed due to the implementation of the Ord@@ in@@ ance on the sale of Urugu@@ ay@@ an creations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of ref@@ unds or other promotion measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb , as well as from slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lambs , takes place only at prices and conditions that comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of world trade with these products .
these terms shall be interpreted in a way compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 paragraph 2 letter c ) of the Convention for the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General In@@ come and Trade Agreement .
Uruguay guarantees compliance with this agreement , in particular by placing the quantities of export lic@@ ences specified under this agreement for the products listed under number 1 .
for its part , the Community ple@@ dges to take all necessary precau@@ tions so that the distribution of import licenses for the aforementioned products with the origin in Uruguay is made dependent upon the submission of an export licence , which is issued by the competent authority designated by the Urugu@@ ay@@ an government .
in addition , it also stipul@@ ates that the competent ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an authority of the competent body of the Community is informed at regular intervals that the quantities have been granted for the export lic@@ ences ; these data may be en@@ forced , if necessary , to the country of destination .
this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community applies , and on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Austria , on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Eastern Europe on the other .
it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after that date it remains in force , subject to the right of any party to termin@@ ate it in writing with a period of one year .
in any case , the provisions of this Agreement shall be reviewed by the two parties before 1 April 1984 with regard to changes that they consider necessary .
I would be grateful if you would confirm me with the consent of your government with this letter .

a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples that contain the an@@ tigen that is hom@@ olo@@ g to the antibody or another on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the way recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) adhesive properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured twice in a suitable medium by di@@ lution of the re@@ agent being examined .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest serum di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; di@@ lution is calculated solely for volume of blood cells in@@ undation in the total volume .
in Anti @-@ A , Anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents , which are to be used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization has set up Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination International standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are elabor@@ ated at the time standards .
according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents to determine the blood group determination of most of the specific@@ ity is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ tis observed in a series of di@@ lution in er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ undation .
the ti@@ ter releases the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the final mixture within a series where a micro@@ scopic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , for which international standard preparations are present ( currently Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as an entire anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of the unknown re@@ agent in comparison with the International Standard drug or a state standard preparation in international units ( See Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .
if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ ears according to definition contain 256 Internationale units per ml .
the preparations are available for free from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of a comparative ti@@ tr@@ ation of the international standard anti @-@ A ( S ) and an unknown anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2B . &gt; P@@ IC FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties shall remain for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in liquid form according to the label is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ iry date indicated on the label for dry re@@ agents is based on the results of the durability tests ; it is approved by the state supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is closed so that no moisture can penetrate .
a dry re@@ agent may loose at most 0.5 BC of its weight if it is tested by further drying above phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxi@@ b at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotics are added to the re@@ agent ( or the solvents supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) if the re@@ agent continues to fulfill the requirements for specific@@ ity and efficacy .
sera human sources for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein nitrogen per ml of liquid or re @-@ dissolved serum .
re@@ agents , regardless of whether in liquid form or after re @-@ dissolution , must be transparent and must contain neither sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles .
the re@@ agents required for international exchange to determine blood group determination should not be arti@@ fici@@ ally colored , at least until an international agreement has come about through a uniform system .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent located in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has to conduct written records on all stages of production and controls of re@@ agents for blood group measurement .
proper samples of all of the re@@ agents issued are to be kept from the laboratory for a long time until some probability can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
re@@ agents used to determine blood group can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective share , the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are divided into three groups according to the origin of their active part .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin or that animal or plant re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin .
on each container a black and white printed label can be attached in English and French , which contains the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the amount or , in the case of dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid required for re @-@ dissolution ,
furthermore , this label or the label on the box in which the individual containers are located or the instructions attached to the vessels contain the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
3. the amount or , in the case of dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid required for re @-@ dissolution ,
each shipment shall be accompanied by a certificate in accordance with Article 4 of the Convention in accordance with the Annex to this Protocol .

in addition , it is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ ums or a corresponding comparative preparation against in@@ undation of B @-@ blood cells .
the effectiveness of the serum may in no case be less than 64 international units per ml .
anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) blood serum may also cause an easily recognizable ag@@ glut@@ ination of the blood cells of the group A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) .
if an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed on an object carrier with equal amounts of 5@@ - to 10 percent floo@@ ding of A1 and A2 blood cells , ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double period required when the same tests are carried out with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ ums or with a standard preparation of the same activity .
