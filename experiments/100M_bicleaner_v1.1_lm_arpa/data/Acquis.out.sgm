<seg id="646">B) To ensure optimum cost effectiveness, the following procedures are applied, for example: I) spatial fingernation as a means to determine the material balance zones for accounting purposes;</seg>
<seg id="647">III) Concentration of the review process on the phases of the fuel cycle, which could be the manufacture, processing, use and storage of nuclear materials, from which other nuclear weapons and other nuclear warps could be produced, and the greatest possible restriction of the verification process in other core material, provided that this does not hinder the implementation of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="648">A) To effectively carry out the security measures under this Convention, the Community of Organisation in accordance with this Convention provides information on core material which is subject to securing measures, and about the characteristics of the equipment used to carry out the securing measures in relation to this material of concern.</seg>
<seg id="649">B) i) The organization requires only the minimum of information and data that is compatible with the implementation of its duties under this Convention.</seg>
<seg id="650">II) Information on investments shall be limited to the minimum required for the use of safety measures in regard to core material, which is subject to the securing measures under this Convention.</seg>
<seg id="651">C) At the request of the Community, the organization is willing to check investment data which the community considers to be particularly vulnerable to the premises of the community.</seg>
<seg id="652">These data do not require the organisation to be transferred materially unless they remain accessible for further review by the organization in the premises of the Community.</seg>
<seg id="653">A) i) The organization obtains the consent of the Community and states to the naming of inspectors for the States.</seg>
<seg id="654">II) If the Community is canceling either a proposed designation or at any time, the Organization of Community and States proposes one or more alternative denominations.</seg>
<seg id="655">III) In response to the repeated refusal of the Community to agree to the nomination of inspectors of the organization, which is hampered by this Convention, the Council shall discuss the refusal, after referred to as "the General Director," in the following as "the General Director," with the aim of meeting appropriate measures.</seg>
<seg id="656">B) The Community and the States concerned shall take the necessary steps to ensure that the inspectors of the organization can actually fulfill the tasks assigned to them in accordance with their Convention.</seg>
<seg id="657">(C) The visits and activities of the inspectors of the Organization shall be established in such a way that i) are as small as possible for the possible harassment and disturbance for the community and the states and for the peaceful nuclear activities underlying the inspection;</seg>
<seg id="658">II) secures the protection of industrial secrets and other confidential information to the inspectors of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="659">Each State applies to the Organization, including its assets, funds and assets, as well as to its inspectors and other officials, carrying out tasks according to this agreement, the corresponding provisions of the agreement on the prerogatives and liberations of the International Atomic Energy Agency.</seg>
<seg id="660">The security measures under this agreement are terminated in relation to core material, if the community and the organization establish that the material has been depleted or diluted in a way that it is no longer usable or practically non-recoverable for a nuclear activity which is under the point of view of the securing measures of Belang.</seg>
<seg id="661">In accordance with this Convention, the Community notifies the organization of the transfer of nuclear material from States that is subject to the securing measures in accordance with this Convention.</seg>
<seg id="662">The security measures under this Convention shall be terminated in relation to core material as soon as the recipient state, as provided in this Convention, has assumed responsibility for it.</seg>
<seg id="663">The organization carries out documents from which any transfer and, if necessary, the reuse of the backup measures on the further core material.</seg>
<seg id="664">Should core material, which is subject to safety measures under this agreement, be used for non-nuclear activities, such as the manufacture of alloys or ceramics, the community agrees with the organization of such use of the material under which circumstances the securing measures may be terminated in accordance with this agreement with regard to this material.</seg>
<seg id="665">II) That the material used during the duration of the non-application of the securing measures under this Convention is not used for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear warhead bodies.</seg>
<seg id="666">B) The organization and the Community conclude a regulation that the securing measures envisaged in this Convention shall only be applied for as long as the core material is used in such an activity.</seg>
<seg id="667">In the scheme, as far as possible, we determine how long and under what circumstances these securing measures are not applied.</seg>
<seg id="668">In any case, the security measures envisaged in this Convention shall be re-applied once the nuclear material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity.</seg>
<seg id="669">The organization is kept informed of the total quantity and composition of this material in the respective state or states concerned and on any passing on of such material from this state or of these states.</seg>
<seg id="670">This explains their agreement as quickly as possible; it extends only to matters, such as temporary and procedural provisions and agreements for reporting, but does not include an endorsement or non-disclosure knowledge of the military activity and does not refer to the subsequent use of the nuclear material.</seg>
<seg id="671">The organization, the community and the states bear the costs that each of them will grow in carrying out their respective obligations under the agreement.</seg>
<seg id="672">If the Community, States or persons subject to their sovereign power, however, are liable for extraordinary expenses as a result of a special search of the organization, the organization reimburses these costs insofar as it has settled in advance.</seg>
<seg id="673">In any case, the organization carries the costs of all additional measurements and samples required by the inspectors of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="674">The Community and the States ensure that liability for nuclear damage, including insurance or other financial security, may be used according to its laws and other provisions, to the organisation and its officials for the purposes of carrying out this Convention in the same way as to the nationals of the States.</seg>
<seg id="675">Any claim that the Community or a State against the Organization or the Organization towards the Community or any State due to damage - with the exception of damage from a nuclear incident - has been asserted, which resulted from the implementation of the securing measures under this Convention, is governed in accordance with international law.</seg>
<seg id="676">After examination of the relevant information submitted by the Director General, the Council shall ensure that the Organization has not been able to assert itself by verifying that no core material which has to be subject to safety measures under this Convention may reimburse the reports provided in Article XII (C) of the Statutes and, if necessary, also take the other measures provided therein.</seg>
<seg id="677">In such a step, the Council considers the mass of measures applied by the applied securing measures, and provides the community or the state - to the extent that each of the two parties involved is affected - every justifiable opportunity to give the Council the necessary security.</seg>
<seg id="678">On request of the Organization, Community or State, consultations are held on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention.</seg>
<seg id="679">The Community and the States are entitled to request that any questions arising out of the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be examined by the Council.</seg>
<seg id="680">The Council invites the community and the state concerned to participate in the discussion of such issues through the Council.</seg>
<seg id="681">With the exception of disputes arising from an assessment of the Council in accordance with Article 19 or a decision taken by the Council, disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be resolved on the request of a party of arbitration, consisting of five arbitrators.</seg>
<seg id="682">The Community and the states designate two arbitrators, the organization also names two arbitrators, and the four arbitrators appointed arbitrators shall elect a fifth which will lead the presidency.</seg>
<seg id="683">If the Community and the States or the Organization have not named two arbitrators within thirty days of the request for an Arbitral Tribunal, the Community or the Organization may seek the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint the arbitrators.</seg>
<seg id="684">The same procedure shall apply if the fifth arbitrator has not yet been elected within thirty days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitrator.</seg>

<seg id="727">The supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention. the organization, the community and the states undertake all efforts to make these agreements come into force within ninety days after the entry into force of this Convention; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization, the community and the states.</seg>
<seg id="728">On the basis of the initial report cited in Article 62, the organization sets up a summarized inventory of the entire core material in the states, irrespective of its origin, and carries out this inventory directory on the basis of the following reports and the results of their investigations.</seg>
<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States Belgium, Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation (organization) on the other</seg>
<seg id="730">The EWG has decided to contribute to the special action programme set out at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low incomes, whose development is hampered by common resource transfer problems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) The aim of the EEC and the Member States is that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months of the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible is spent within two years after the entry into force in the form of loans, and the organisation will do its best to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">D) The EEC and the organisation have consulted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bonds in order to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">To this end, the Organization of the EEC has presented a table, which is intended to determine in which way it intends to apply the criteria set forth in this agreement -</seg>
<seg id="734">The organization arranges a special account under the name "special transactions account" which consists of the funds that the Member States are governed and used in accordance with this agreement in accordance with this Agreement; this account is referred to as "Administrator" by the Organization, only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The special transaction accounts are led separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The contributions are to be paid as follows: a) The payment is made in the form of cash or non-interest debtors of the Member State, which are to be paid upon request in the currency of the respective state to order the organization as administrator of the special transactions account and to deposit at the office of the organization in the country concerned.</seg>
<seg id="737">B) the payment is made in two instalments (i) the first in the amount of at least 45 BGN. the contribution within 30 days of entering into force of this agreement or any other between the EEC and the Administrator date;</seg>
<seg id="738">II) the second in the amount of the remainder of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or another time agreed between the EEC and the Administrator, taking into account the deadlines required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans.</seg>
<seg id="739">C) Any Member State may, upon request, make payments to the above mentioned deadlines.</seg>
<seg id="740">According to the usual procedure of the organization, the caretaker takes approximately proportional draw on the cash or the school-jones to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and to balance the special transactions account in an appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="741">In the case of granting these loans, the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">III) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the country's current and foreseeable economic problems;</seg>
<seg id="743">(VI) the composition and tendency of the country's debt service and its further lending capacity to loan terms without discount; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) the extent to which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Each special transaction loan is used to finance a clearly returnable development program or project (including a sectoral plan), regardless of whether it is part of the organisation's loan programme or not, according to the procedures and practices considered for the development credits financed by the Organization, which is to be considered under letter b) of the preamble to this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="746">The funds of the special transactions account may not be used instead of the Bank's International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank) or organization which is bound within the framework of a loan or credit for a program or project which has already been approved by directors of the Bank or the Organisation on the date of the entry into force of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="747">Apart from Section 4, special transactions are subject to the same repayment terms that apply to the loan granted to the organization in general; therefore, they are refundable in 50 years for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="748">Special transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are refundable in these currencies.</seg>
<seg id="749">Amounts for payment of this bib are to be made directly to the organization that retains them.</seg>
<seg id="750">Each special loan is to be indicated by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator, in particular the origin of the funds is stated.</seg>
<seg id="751">The proceeds from each transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services established or furnished in a Member State; ii) in developing countries, which may be members of the organization and may be recipients of a loan granted at the time of the loan granted.</seg>
<seg id="752">The capital repayments of a special transaction loan are made to the special transaction account, and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state shall be returned to the Member State after its receipt as soon as possible from the administrator.</seg>
<seg id="753">The Administrator informs the EEC about the plans and programmes approved by the directors for the audit by the directors in preparation and through the intentions and programmes approved by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the time of payment of the special loans, the Administrator informs the EEC quarterly on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenses made for this.</seg>
<seg id="755">The caretaker transmits the EEC as soon as possible after the conclusion of the financial year of the organization a detailed statement of the special transactions account with an opinion of the external auditors of the organization to this account statement.</seg>
<seg id="756">After a full payment of the special transaction loan, the administrator of the EEC conveys a detailed report on the projects and programmes financed by the special transaction account.</seg>
<seg id="757">The administrator creates and executes appropriate records and invoices from which the contributions to the special transaction account, the amounts paid out of the account receipts and the amounts paid out of the account and the repayments to the Member States are visible.</seg>
<seg id="758">The EEC and the caretakers work closely together to achieve the aims of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="759">To this end, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the caretaker until the complete edition of the means of the special transaction account will exchange ideas about the status of the special transaction account, the progress of programmes or projects financed by special transactions and about any other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="760">If this agreement has not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date, which the EEC and the organisation may agree upon, the agreement and all obligations arising therefrom are due to immediate effect.</seg>
<seg id="761">If the total amount of capital received by the recipients is repaid in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and remitted to the Member States, this agreement and all obligations of the parties resulting therefrom are terminated with immediate effect.</seg>
