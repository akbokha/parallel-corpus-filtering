this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the studies conducted to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package leaf@@ let ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
for further information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg melt tablets ( tablets , which dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ elessly think and speak , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not available ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , a psychological disorder in which patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal high spirits ) alter@@ nat@@ ely with periods of normal mood .
abili@@ fy is used for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and for the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used to quickly control increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders when oral ing@@ es@@ tion of the drug is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be used to deposit or melt tablets in patients who difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time , the same as A@@ bili@@ fy should be taken away , the dose should be adjusted by A@@ bili@@ fy .
this interfer@@ es with the transmission of signals between brain cells by means of &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. , chemical substances that allow neur@@ ons to communicate with each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is probably mainly known as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; partial ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in less extent than the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter works to activate the recept@@ ors .
since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l contributes to norm@@ alizing the brain activity by reducing psycho@@ tic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing their recur@@ r@@ ence .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent the recur@@ r@@ ence of symptoms has been studied in three studies for up to one year .
the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar disorders , suffering from increased un@@ rest , over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo .
in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to prevent recur@@ r@@ ence in 160 patients with whom the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ sed with A@@ bili@@ fy .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ zing injection was compared in a study to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , suffering from increased un@@ rest , compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psycho@@ tic ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
all studies examined the change in the symptoms of patients on the basis of a standard bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the enam@@ el tablets and the solution to intake ( absor@@ bs ) .
in both trials with the injection solution , patients who received abili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg showed significantly greater rest@@ lessness of symptoms than those receiving plac@@ ebo .
in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy , in four of the five short @-@ term studies , reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than plac@@ ebo .
abili@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than plac@@ ebo for the recur@@ r@@ ence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 mg doses were also more effective than plac@@ ebo for the symptoms of increased un@@ rest and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common A@@ bili@@ ti@@ fy side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extra@@ pyr@@ amid@@ al disorders ( un@@ controlled cken ) , fatigue ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , headache , blur@@ red vision , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( loss of s@@ ali@@ va ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disturbances ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of abili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who were mostly man@@ ic episodes were out@@ weigh@@ ed against the risks .
in addition , the committee concluded that the benefits of the injection solution in the fast control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . approval for launching A@@ bili@@ fy in the European Union .
abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes were addressing the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
an increased effectiveness in dos@@ ages at a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of abili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
considering the greater sensitivity of these patients , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the dosage should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psycho@@ tic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases at the beginning or after a change of an anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , also in case of treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that there was no increased risk of suicide in patients with bi@@ polar disorder compared to other anti@@ psycho@@ tics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disturbances ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including active and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ lau@@ z@@ l .
if symptoms and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occur in a patient treated with A@@ bili@@ fy , should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms indic@@ ative of a M@@ NS or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psycho@@ tics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be de@@ posed .
therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease had an increased risk of death compared to plac@@ ebo .
however , there was in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and response for adverse cervi@@ cal events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ lau@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic agents , including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there are no precise risk estimates for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia related adverse events in patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ phen@@ uria , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored regarding a deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
because of the primary efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is required when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective drugs with super@@ imposed side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ lau@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; Bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) Met@@ aboli@@ zing can result in the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabolism met@@ abo@@ lic@@ ates .
considering the common administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , the potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and similar can reductions should be made .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ or , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be lifted to the dose level prior to the start of the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be administered with a moderate rise in Ari@@ pi@@ lau@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ ran@@ z@@ ole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the medi@@ ums of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ phi@@ c / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine @-@ ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ phi@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy while treating Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
this drug may not be used during pregnancy because of the insufficient data layer to ensure safety for humans and because of the concerns arising from the reproduction studies of the animal , unless the potential benefits justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fo@@ etus .
however , as with other anti@@ psycho@@ tics , patients should be warned of using dangerous machinery , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has no negative influence on them .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) compared to plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - in a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole a total of lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including par@@ affin , D@@ yst@@ onia and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , was compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ ro@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with plac@@ ebo .
another controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks was the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients suffering from om@@ is@@ ap@@ ine therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance - in a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 23.@@ 5 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ lau@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ ro@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ lau@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
a comparison between the patient groups in Ari@@ pi@@ lau@@ z@@ ole and Plac@@ ebo , with potentially clin@@ ically significant changes to rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters , showed no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ id kin@@ ase ) , transi@@ ent and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ lau@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the side effects that can occur in connection with an anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , and also reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ lau@@ z@@ ole , include the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , undes@@ irable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death .
although there is no information about the efficacy of a ha@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that ha@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis is useful in the treatment of over@@ dosing , as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma performance .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ ran@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partially antagon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in vitro showed a high aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 @-@ receptor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 and 5@@ HT@@ 2a @-@ receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4 , ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for 2 weeks of healthy subjects , the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of the binding of 11@@ C Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 @-@ receptor lig@@ ands , at the nucle@@ us cau@@ d@@ us and on the Put@@ beam .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term trials ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a half @-@ surgery @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of respon@@ der patients who had a response to study medication in week 52 were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales , defined as secondary study objectives , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depression rate scale , showed significantly stronger improvement than at hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study for 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return , which was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ ro@@ zo@@ l group and 57 % in plac@@ ebo .
in an os@@ he@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , involving 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , significantly fewer patients had a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of approximately ca . ) .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trials with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a superi@@ ority compared to plac@@ ebo in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial for 3 weeks with fixed doses with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superi@@ ority compared to plac@@ ebo .
in two plac@@ ebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trials over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic tra@@ its , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a effectiveness in week 3 versus plac@@ ebo , comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
in week 12 , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a comparable share of patients suffering from sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic features , which in some cases did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed superi@@ ority in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period of 74 weeks for man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l during a phase of stabili@@ zation before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l was superior to plac@@ ebo with regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar return , mainly in the prevention of a revers@@ al in the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies the enzyme C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ ell@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ de@@ al@@ ky@@ lam@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean elimination time is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l for extensive metabolism via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) met@@ abo@@ lic@@ ates via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical examination of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia showed no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a population @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in eth@@ ni@@ city or the impact of smoking on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ ran@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose trial in patients with various h@@ ep@@ atic cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impair@@ ment of the liver function to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ lau@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ lau@@ z@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on the conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data showed no particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , therefore they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent bor@@ ro@@ c@@ ine @-@ tox@@ in @-@ toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase of adren@@ al rin@@ ds carcin@@ omas and combined adren@@ al @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose for humans ) .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the middle steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ fold the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 .
however , at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found concentrations of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ lau@@ z@@ ole were no more than 6 % of the concentrations observed in the study for 39 weeks in the g@@ all of monkeys and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro solu@@ bility .
in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 times the middle steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

15 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ lau@@ z@@ l .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ ran@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partially antagon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .

the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing A@@ bili@@ fy tablets can alternatively take the enam@@ el tablets to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psycho@@ tic diseases and aff@@ ective disorder was reported in some cases at the beginning or after a change of an anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , also in case of treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ lau@@ z@@ l .
clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS are high fever , muscle rigi@@ dity , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , per@@ spir@@ ation and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .

it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ ran@@ zo@@ l in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partially antagon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .

abili@@ fy injection solution is used to quickly control det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder when oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution should be terminated and started with oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
to increase the res@@ or@@ ption and to minimize vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deeply into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended by circum@@ v@@ enting adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical state taking into account the medicine already applied for maintenance or acute therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .

poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ phen@@ uria , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored regarding a deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .

the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ lau@@ z@@ ol@@ - and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with plac@@ ebo .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ lau@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS was 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ ro@@ zo@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
a comparison between the patient groups in Ari@@ pi@@ lau@@ z@@ ole and Plac@@ ebo , with potentially clin@@ ically significant changes to rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters , showed no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , transi@@ ent and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ lau@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the side effects that can occur in connection with an anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , and also reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ lau@@ z@@ ole , include the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ ity , undes@@ irable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al dysfunction was the Ari@@ pi@@ ran@@ zo@@ l injection solution associated with statisti@@ cally significant greater improvements of det@@ achment / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ ran@@ zo@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in symptoms regarding det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .

in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe nausea , similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined on the basis of a decreased patient count .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term trials ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a half @-@ surgery @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of respon@@ der patients who had a response to study medication in week 52 were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales , defined as secondary study objectives , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ depression rate scale , showed significantly stronger improvement than at hal@@ operi@@ dol .
plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ lau@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % in plac@@ ebo .

in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension for man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l during a phase of stabili@@ zation before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l was superior to plac@@ ebo with regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar return , mainly in the prevention of a revers@@ al in the man@@ ia .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C in the first 2 hours after in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular injection 90 % larger the AU@@ C after administration of the same dose as tablet ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy subjects , the average time was 1 to 3 hours before reaching the maximum plasma level .
the administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l inj@@ ections was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated administration in a systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cul@@ arly in 15@@ - and 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity after intraven@@ ous application no safety @-@ related concerns about mat@@ ernal exposure , the 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) were above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) for safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data showed no particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure of humans ; therefore they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al rin@@ gene toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ ma cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase of adren@@ al @-@ state @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the middle @-@ state @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose for humans ) .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters had previously had an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in all@@ u@@ vial administration or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with a drug containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
overall , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients treated the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
only those patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer were not able to make a difference between the efficacy indicators , such as time to deterioration of the disease and survival .
on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer were shown in regards to these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
it may also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood before the treatment begins .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drug @-@ containing drugs and that contrary to other drugs containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , it does not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited appro@@ ving the launching of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients in whom the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease has failed and is not shown for a standard anth@@ ra@@ cy@@ line @-@ containing therapy ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
in the case of sensory Neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ie Grade 3 , the treatment must be interrupted until an improvement is reached to grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no adequate data for dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies were conducted in patients with impaired ren@@ al function and there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adaptation in patients with impair@@ ment of ren@@ al function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could have much other pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment should be initiated , and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el again .
in patients no further abrasion @-@ cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils count rises to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the plat@@ el@@ et number has increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function disorders ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with abrasion .
while a kar@@ di@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity associated with Abra@@ x@@ ane was not detected , cardiac incidents in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
if nausea , vom@@ iting and diarr@@ ho@@ ea occur in patients after the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti @-@ methods and con@@ sti@@ pation .
abrasion should not be applied to pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
women at child@@ bearing age should use a reliable contrac@@ eption method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to not give birth to a child during and up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should be advised against the treatment of sperm con@@ serving , since the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of irre@@ versi@@ bly in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects like ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can affect the per@@ spir@@ ation and the ability to operate machinery .
listed below are the most common and most significant incidents of adverse events reported in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al Phase III study once every three weeks at 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most prominent hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy at each dose and indication in trials ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) ; very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in blood , increased cre@@ atine in blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :
dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ gia , flat@@ ul@@ ence , tongue @-@ burning , dry mouth , aching g@@ ums , loose stool , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , pain in the lower abdom@@ en , sor@@ es in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract :
pain in the thor@@ ax wall , weakness of muscles , neck pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature , joint pain , discomfort in limbs , muscle weakness Very frequent :
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
as these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual incidence are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events has been established .
Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules ingredient that promotes the positioning of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ bul@@ b@@ ules and stabili@@ zes mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ u@@ bul@@ ous network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in the framework of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ i@@ theli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ umin@@ re@@ zep@@ tor and , due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( sec@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) , a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation occurs in the area of the tumor .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single @-@ arm un@@ matched studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ized phase III comparative study .
in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 as in@@ fusion was used over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multic@@ entre study was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer , who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el every 3 weeks , either in form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medication for the prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of abrasion 260 mg / m2 as a 30 minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a negative general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had previously received no chemotherapy , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only for metastatic disease and 19 % for metastatic disease and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the overall response rate and time until progression @-@ free survival and progression @-@ free survival for patients receiving first @-@ line therapy are stated below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by improving one degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy with grade 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy towards sin@@ king on bas@@ eline based on the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 courses of treatment was not evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 were obtained in clinical trials .
the Ex@@ pos@@ ure Ex@@ pos@@ ure ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml analog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 Accor@@ ding to the intraven@@ ous administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase way .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates a far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ ascular allocation and / or soft tissue linking of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study involving patients with advanced solid tum@@ ours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after IV @-@ 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane were compared with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
after the Abra@@ x@@ ane administration , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el Clear@@ ance was higher ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily metaboli@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ inary ex@@ cre@@ tion was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , indicating a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearance .
over 75 years of age , however , only a few data are available , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and against light light over 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti @-@ carcin@@ ogen@@ ic drug and , as with other potentially toxic substances , caution must be observed when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe , slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion fluid is inj@@ ected into an Abra@@ x@@ ane flow bottle .
after completing the solution , the water tank should rest for at least 5 minutes in order to ensure a good wet@@ ting of the solids .
then the water tank should be swi@@ vel@@ ed slowly and gently for at least 2 minutes and / or inver@@ ted until a complete suspension of the powder is done .
if precip@@ itations or sin@@ ks are visible , the water @-@ through bottle must again be inver@@ ted gently in order to achieve a complete residual suspension before application .

if you are using Abra@@ x@@ ane with other medicines , please inform the doctor if you use other medicines or have recently used them , even if they are not prescription medicines , as they might cause an interaction with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
women at child@@ bearing age should use a reliable contrac@@ eption method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
in addition , before the treatment , they should be advised of a sperm con@@ serving because the Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment gives the possibility of permanent in@@ fertility .
air@@ ti@@ ghtness and abrasion of machines Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects like ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can affect the per@@ spir@@ ation and ability to operate machinery .

member states must ensure that the holder appro@@ ves the medical professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials prior to the market launch :
• Training leaf@@ let • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the drug ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packaging inserts . • Uni@@ que imaging of the correct application of the product provided by the patient with clear visual representation of the correct application of the product .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is used in patients with normal blood @-@ blood values , in which complications may occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion if a blood don@@ or is not possible before the procedure and a loss of blood from 900 to 1,@@ 800 ml is expected .
treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with disorders indicated by the medicine .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who wish to make their own blood don@@ ors , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
the injection can also be made by the patient or his super@@ visor , provided that they have received appropriate instructions .
in patients with chronic kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency and in patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values should always be at the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients must be checked prior to treatment in order to ensure that no iron deficiency is present and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment .
in patients who receive chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by an er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etal deficiency , or that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the results of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to a V@@ ene in a primary study involving 4@@ 79 patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o into a v@@ ein for at least eight weeks before either switching to stre@@ amed or receiving E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of sub@@ mar@@ amed under the skin were studied with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study involving patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who were switched to Ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained to the same degree as in those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0,@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12,@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which may occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , p@@ ung@@ ent mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as inj@@ ections under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that it does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed under the European Union regulations it was established that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company , which produces ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide information packages for the medical professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Medi@@ ce Medic@@ inal P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG appro@@ ving the marketing of Ab@@ se@@ amed in the European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion needs in adults with solid tum@@ ours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ omas or multiple my@@ el@@ oma , which receive chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion exists due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) .
the treatment should only be carried out in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , in case of planned larger surgical procedures , which require a large blood volume ( 4 or more units of blood in men ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) .
Ab@@ se@@ amed can be applied before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic intervention in adults with no iron deficiency , where a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml may not be applied to an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients , where the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease ; therefore , the doctor needs to evaluate the individual clinical course and condition of the disease .
an increase in ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values can be observed over or below the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration in a patient .
in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the target concentration of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose which is required for control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia .
these clinical findings suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients with initial an@@ a@@ emia less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
these clinical findings suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week using intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
symptoms of an@@ emia and sequ@@ el@@ ae may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease ; therefore , the doctor needs to evaluate the individual clinical course and condition of the disease .
in view of this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the target concentration of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose which is required for the control of the an@@ a@@ emia .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the coefficient of re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ sis by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l against the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase is increased &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the coefficient of recur@@ ren@@ ces &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose should be raised to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value ≥ ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ sis value increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week .
if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) resp@@ . the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l against the initial value , a response to epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be interrupted .
patients with mild an@@ emia ( ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit 33 @-@ 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary storage of ≥ 4 blood con@@ ser@@ ae is required , received a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg of body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery .
the iron sub@@ stitution should start as early as possible - e.g. several weeks before the beginning of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the ab@@ se@@ amed therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg Ep@@ som al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
in this case , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg on 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis can be given via the tube of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to flush the hose and ensure sufficient inj@@ ections of the drug into the circulation .
patients suffering from er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin with any er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin on er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stur@@ en@@ ia ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive a stre@@ amed or other er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stop@@ en@@ ia ) .
heart attack or stroke within one month before treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ li@@ sm ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ estic known ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ li@@ sm ) .
in patients who are en@@ visi@@ oned for a major elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic surgery and who cannot take part in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , accompanying or underlying disease : severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion , vascular disease of the oti@@ tis or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently introduced heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stop@@ en@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported about the appearance of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after mon@@ ate@@ - to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of effect , defined as reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value should be determined and the usual causes for a non @-@ response ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umini@@ umin@@ escence , infections or inflamm@@ ations , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined .
if the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin antibodies ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ k@@ oc@@ yte figures are normal , and if no other reason of an effective loss is found , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row should be considered for the diagnosis of a PR@@ CA .
data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk for antibody @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
in clinical trials , increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ic @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit attributed to the administration of epo@@ e@@ as if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required to control the symptoms of an@@ a@@ emia and the avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase should be about 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month in order to minimize the risk of an increase in hyper@@ tension .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evident cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or st@@ ow@@ age in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
according to the present findings , an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , is not accelerated progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
for tumour patients under chemotherapy , a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin response should be taken into account for evaluating the therapy efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ( patients who may need to be trans@@ acted ) .
if the H@@ b increase is exceeded than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia - dose adjustment with the goal of holding the ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to apply re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the involvement of the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are en@@ visi@@ oned for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly before the beginning of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy .
patients undergoing a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should have appropriate thro@@ mb@@ os@@ e@@ pro@@ phyla@@ xis , since they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic and vascular diseases , especially with a underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , an increased risk of postoperative th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic / vascular events can be assumed when treating with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an output threshold of &gt; 13 g / dl .
in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ine was not proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy was returned if a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 @-@ 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ dosage should be adapted to the rising ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit .
in vitro studies on tumor tissues , there are no indications of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation .
through th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , cereb@@ ral inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , isch@@ em@@ ic thro@@ mb@@ oses , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , an@@ eur@@ y@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treatment , so also patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent rise in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients treated with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ines .
regardless of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treatment , surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations can lead to th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic and vascular complications .
the genetically derived epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ sili@@ zed and is identical with the endo@@ genous human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ em@@ ic patients regarding the amino acids and the carbohydr@@ ate content .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ ov@@ ese .
3@@ 89 patients with hem@@ ost@@ asis ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ omes , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ d@@ g@@ kin@@ - lymph@@ omas and 24 further hem@@ og@@ lob@@ sters ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tum@@ ours ( 172 breast cancer tum@@ ors , 23 lung cancer , 22 prostate carcin@@ omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas , and 30 more ) .
in 1895 , patients with solid tum@@ ours ( 6@@ 83 m@@ am@@ o@@ carcin@@ omas , 260 bron@@ chi@@ al cancer , 174 g@@ yn@@ a@@ ecological tum@@ ors , 300 gastro@@ intestinal tum@@ ors and 4@@ 78 others ) and 80@@ 2 patients with hem@@ ost@@ asis .
survival and progression were examined in five major controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin and the control patient .
in these studies , patients with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin showed a more consistent , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality compared to controls due to a number of common malign@@ an@@ cies .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ oses and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin and with controls .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results can be transferred to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin in tumour patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , as a few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa provisions after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy subjects and a somewhat prolonged half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels achieved after intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no accumulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
bone mar@@ mon@@ ary fibro@@ sis is a well known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for three years , the incidence of bone mar@@ ital fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
14 In animal studies with approximately the 20@@ x of the weekly dose recommended for human use , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa resulted in reduced federal body weight , a delay in the oscill@@ ation and an increase in the fet@@ al mortality .
these reports rely on in vitro findings with cells from human tumor tissue samples , but are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation .
as part of the out@@ patient application , the patient can store Ab@@ se@@ amed once for a period of up to 3 days outside the fridge and not over 25 ° C .

prior to the market launch and in accordance with the agreement with the competent authorities of the Member States , the holder appro@@ ves the medical professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials : • Training leaf@@ let • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the product ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packaging inserts .
the holder of the marketing authorization must ensure that the pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance system described in version 3.0 is set up and functioning in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. the drug vig@@ il@@ ance system is set up before the medicine is brought into circulation and as long as the medicine is used in the traffic .
the holder of the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) , listed in the pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance plan , agrees to implement the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) listed in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. of the authorisation application , as well as to carry out the update of the Risk Management Plan pursuant to each subsequent revision of the CH@@ MP .
according to the &quot; CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal use , &quot; an updated R@@ MP should be provided simultaneously with the next updated report on the safety of the drug ( Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) .
in addition , an upgraded R@@ MP should be submitted : • Up@@ on receiving new information that may have an impact on current safety specifications , the pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance plan or the risk reduction measures , within 60 days of reaching an important ( the pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance or risk reduction ) mil@@ estones - after so@@ lic@@ itation by the E@@ MEA
• If you suffer from a heart attack or stroke within a month before your treatment • if you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( first occurring or increased chest pain ) , there is a risk of le@@ aking in the veins ( deep ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ) - if , for example , such a blood c@@ lot has occurred to you , for example .
you suffer from severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial vascular disease ) , the cervi@@ cal vessels ( vascular disease of the oti@@ des ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) you recently suffered a heart attack or stroke .
during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets can occur within the normal range , which re@@ forms again in further treatment .
your doctor may carry out regular blood tests if necessary to regularly check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
lack of iron , dis@@ solving red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency , should be taken into account before starting therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed .
very rare was reported on the appearance of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sting after mon@@ ate@@ - to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin .
if you suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a , it will ab@@ ort your treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection into a v@@ ein ( intraven@@ ously ) if you are treated because of an an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value could be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
in case of elevated or rising potassium levels , your doctor may consider an interruption of treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels are again in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney disease and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or traffic signs due to insufficient heart rate , your doctor will make sure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and the desired effect should be considered for evaluating the efficacy of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your values of red blood colour@@ ant ( ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and adjust your am@@ amed dose accordingly , in order to minimize the risk of bo@@ unc@@ ing ( th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic event ) as low as possible .
this risk should be weigh@@ ed very carefully compared to the advantages derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic vascular events , for example if you are obes@@ e ( obes@@ e ) or when th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic vascular events have occurred ( e.g. deep ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis or pneum@@ em@@ bo@@ li@@ sm ) .
if you are cancer patient , remember that Ab@@ se@@ amed acts as a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances can adver@@ sely affect the tumour .
if you require a larger orthop@@ edic surgery , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly before the start of treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed .
if your values of red blood colour@@ ant ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get Ab@@ se@@ amed , as there is an increased risk of blood cl@@ ump formation after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / used medication even if it is not prescription medicine .
if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means of supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may possibly arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F ) .
depending on how your an@@ emia ( an@@ emia ) appeals to treatment , the dose may be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control .
if necessary , your doctor will arrange regular blood tests to check the success of your treatment and to make sure that the medicine works properly and your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
as soon as you are well set , regular doses of Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg are given twice a week , spread on two equally large inj@@ ections .
if necessary , your doctor will arrange regular blood tests to check the success of the treatment and to make sure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how an@@ a@@ emia refers to treatment , the dose may be adjusted approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to ensure this and to ensure that the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the attending physician will carry out regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of the operation and another 4 days after the surgery .
however , if your doctor considers this appropriate for you to also learn how to sp@@ lash Ab@@ se@@ amed yourself under the skin .
heart , heart attacks , cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ages , stroke , transi@@ ent circul@@ atory disorders of the brain , deep ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , vascular diseases ( an@@ eur@@ y@@ sm@@ s ) , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis of the retina and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients under er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treatment .
ey@@ eli@@ ds and lips ( quin@@ tet e@@ dem@@ a ) and sho@@ cking allergic reactions with symptoms such as ting@@ ling , redness , it@@ ching , heat sensation and accelerated pulse were reported in rare cases .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sting means that no longer enough red blood cells can be produced in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Partic@@ ular pru@@ dence in the use of Ab@@ se@@ amed is required &quot; ) .
after repeated blood donations , it can come - regardless of the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed - to a blood vessel formation ( th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic vascular events ) .
treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed can be associated with increased risk of bleeding after surgery ( post @-@ operative th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic vascular events ) , if your output level is too high

Ac@@ last@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause as well as in men .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( bone frac@@ tures ) , including those who have recently suffered a minor trauma such as H@@ inf@@ in ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by injection into a muscle before the first in@@ fusion .
the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ last@@ a can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days after in@@ fusion such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches .
for the treatment of the disease patho@@ gen , Ac@@ last@@ a may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
as the active ingredient in Ac@@ elas@@ a is the same as in Z@@ inn@@ a , part of the data material for z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate Ac@@ elas@@ a .
in the first study , nearly 8@@ ,000 older women were involved in oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of frac@@ tures and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2,@@ 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years .
in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , a total of 3@@ 57 patients were tested in two studies and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indicator of the efficacy was whether the sal@@ ine of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that breaks down bone substance ) in the blood returned to normal or at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women , the risk of ed@@ dy frac@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ reli@@ a ( excluding other oste@@ opor@@ osis therapies ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to the patients .
the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % compared to all patients under Ac@@ up@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis therapies ) .
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ tures , 9 % of patients under Ac@@ up@@ a had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most Ac@@ up@@ a side effects occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less common in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ last@@ a must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at Ac@@ last@@ a are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion point and oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of acet@@ ob@@ a provides educational material for doctors who prescri@@ be acet@@ ob@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains instructions on how to apply the medicine , as well as similar material for patients in whom the side effects of the drug are explained and referred to when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited appro@@ ving the launch of Ac@@ elas@@ a in the European Union .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture .
the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • Suppl@@ ying • contra@@ indication in pregnancy and in breast@@ feeding women • Re@@ quired of appropriate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Major symptoms and symptoms for serious side effects • W@@ ann to resort to medical or nursing assistance
treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg of ac@@ last@@ a is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of acet@@ ob@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a should be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after a treatment of the disease Pa@@ get with Ac@@ last@@ a , a long period of re@@ mission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure a sufficient supply of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , twice daily at least 500 mg of el@@ em@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the application of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ traum@@ atic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular Vitamin D is recommended before the first in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ up@@ a may be reduced by the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of acet@@ am@@ ol .
patients with ren@@ al dysfunction ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearance &lt; 35 ml / min , it is not recommended that there are limited clinical experience for this group of patients .
dosage adjustment is not necessary since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents of Ac@@ last@@ a are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age , since data on safety and efficacy are missing .
in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population .
a pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ c@@ emia is to be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before the therapy starts ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid en@@ for@@ estation of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone remo@@ del@@ ing , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of acet@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure a sufficient supply of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , twice daily at least 500 mg of el@@ em@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the application of Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene ) should undergo a dental examination with appropriate preventive dental treatment before using bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
no data is available for patients who require dental intervention , whether the interruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ deficiency in the jaw region .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk evaluation .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of acet@@ amin@@ op@@ ha@@ ge may be reduced by the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of acet@@ am@@ ol ( see section 4.2 ) .
cases of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation reported as serious side @-@ effects of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation were increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 out of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to those receiving plac@@ ebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ c@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ elas@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in table 1 .
ren@@ al dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c was associated with ren@@ al dysfunction , which expressed itself as a decrease in the ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) and in rare cases referred to as acute ren@@ al failure .
changes in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearing ( measured annually prior to administration ) and kidney failure and a limited ren@@ al function were comparable in a clinical study of oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years , comparable between the plac@@ ebo and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ atine within 10 days after the application was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with ac@@ up@@ a compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the transi@@ ent asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium values , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , occurred in 2.3 % of patients treated with ac@@ last@@ a in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with ac@@ last@@ a in the disease @-@ pa@@ get trials .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures following a hip frac@@ ture and in the mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently l@@ itt@@ led hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D mirrors were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before administration of acet@@ one ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After the administration of cit@@ ric acid in a large clinical study was reported about local reactions at the in@@ fusion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ os@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw region has been reported , especially in cancer patients , through oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primary in the jaw region ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental intervention .
7 patients with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw area of a patient treated with ac@@ up@@ a and in a patient treated with plac@@ ebo .
in the case of an over@@ dose that leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a balance can be achieved by adding oral calcium and / or an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ last@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was indicated in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women between 65 and 89 years ) with either a BM@@ D @-@ T @-@ Score or a BM@@ D @-@ T @-@ Score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ al ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric frac@@ tures of the body were significantly reduced over a period of three years as well as the frequency of one or more new spinal frac@@ tures after one year ( see table 2 ) .
ac@@ last@@ a @-@ treated patients aged 75 and older had a 60 % reduced risk of verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures compared to plac@@ ebo @-@ patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ last@@ a showed a constant effect over three years , which resulted in reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ up@@ a increased bone density in lum@@ bar verteb@@ rate , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to plac@@ ebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase of the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the entire hip by 6.0 % , the thi@@ ghs by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius of 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology in 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis patients who were treated with ac@@ up@@ a ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) were taken from the pel@@ vic base one year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ sies .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tr@@ ab@@ ecular bone volume and the preservation of tr@@ ab@@ ecular bone architecture in patients treated with Ac@@ up@@ a compared to plac@@ ebo .
bone replacement markers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pe@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in the serum and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during study duration .
the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Ac@@ last@@ a significantly reduced B@@ SAP by 30 % after 12 months compared to bas@@ eline and was held at 28 % below the initial value for up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the initial value to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the initial value to 36 months .
the vitamin D mirrors were not rout@@ inely measured but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular ) 2 weeks prior to in@@ fusion .
the overall mort@@ g@@ ages were 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the treated group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , compared to plac@@ ebo treatment , the BM@@ D increased the BM@@ D at the total th@@ igh and neck area at all times .
the treatment resulted in 24 months compared to plac@@ ebo treatment to increase BM@@ D by 5.4 % of the total hip and 4.3 % at the cock@@ le &apos;s neck .
clinical effectiveness in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT trial , 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in the treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in plac@@ ebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) the annual dose of acet@@ one compared to the once weekly administration of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was not inferior to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to bas@@ eline .
clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ last@@ a was examined in patients and patients over 30 years with radi@@ ological confirmed , mainly light to moder@@ ately heavy Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase corresponding to the 2.6 @-@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value when taking into the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate in comparison to the intake of 30@@ mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once a day for 2 months was proven in two six months comparative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to bas@@ eline for Ac@@ last@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as respon@@ ds at the end of the six @-@ month main study ( responded to therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 with ac@@ last@@ a and 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response in 141 of the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at could be maintained for an average duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application .
single and multiple 5 and 15 minute in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ lic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dose @-@ independent .
after that , the plasma levels rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting , very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
fast bi @-@ phase dis@@ appearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β 1,@@ 87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal eli@@ ft survival time t ½ g 146 hours .
the early stages of distribution ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion via the kidneys .
in the first 24 h 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in urine , while the rest is mainly related to bone tissue .
the total body clearance is 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains unaffected by sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion @-@ time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron &apos;s acid concentration by 30 % at the end of in@@ fusion but had no effect on the surface below the curve ( plasma concentration versus time ) .
a dimin@@ ished clearance of substances metaboli@@ zed by cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzymes is unlikely , because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ ric acid is not metaboli@@ zed by humans and because it is a weak or even no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , drug @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) in the 64 examined patients .
this results in a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al dysfunction down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of up to 35 ml / min does not require any dose adjustment of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ cit@@ ric acid .
as for severe ren@@ al dysfunction ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- cle@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data is available , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and rats 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
in dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C were the 6@@ fold of the recommended human therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence .
chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ ric acid in rats was administered by doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , administered in intervals of 2 @-@ 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose corresponding to the 7@@ x of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated exposure in accumulated expos@@ ures that exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects of other organs , including gastro@@ intestinal tract and liver , and intraven@@ ous injection .
the most common cause of repeated use was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hysi@@ sis of long bones in animals during the growth period with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
rats observed a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages of 0,2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity of 0.1 mg / kg was pronounced as a result of low serum @-@ calcium levels .

z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a substance of a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate and is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , the oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the bone patho@@ gen of the bone .
dec@@ lining blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ rogen formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , bone remo@@ del@@ ing takes place too quickly , and new bone material is constructed un@@ ordered , making the bone material weaker than normal .
ac@@ last@@ a works by norm@@ alizing the bone reconstruction back to normal , thereby ensuring normal bone formation and rein@@ forces strength to the bone .
if you are undergoing dental treatment or undergoing dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ last@@ a .
when using ac@@ last@@ a with other medicines please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / used medication even if it is not prescription medicines .
for your doctor it is especially important to know if you are taking pharmaceuticals from which it is known that they are damaging the kidneys .
when using Ac@@ last@@ a , together with food and beverages , you are concerned that you have sufficient fluids according to your doctor &apos;s instructions before and after the treatment with Ac@@ last@@ a .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , given to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
if you recently broke the hips , it is recommended to take the administration of acet@@ one two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
the usual dose is 5 mg given to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
as Ac@@ last@@ a works for a long time , you may need to take another dose after one year or more .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium mirror in your blood is not too low in time after in@@ fusion .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a can work for more than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment .
if you miss the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a , please contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment .
before the treatment with Ac@@ last@@ a If you are contempl@@ ating the completion of the treatment with Ac@@ last@@ a , please take your next medical appointment and discuss it with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion occur very frequently ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less frequent after the subsequent in@@ fusion .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain , and headache , occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a .
currently it is unclear whether Ac@@ last@@ a causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you notice such symptoms when you have received ac@@ last@@ a .

the present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the studies conducted to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medicine ) is not indicated .
it can be used in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( particularly overweight patients ) who cannot be satisfied with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dosage .
in combination with sul@@ fon@@ y@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ fon@@ y@@ amine or insulin can be retained with the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should reduce the dose of the sul@@ fon@@ y@@ sul@@ phi@@ de or insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , which makes Type 2 diabetes better adjusted .
in more than 1 400 patients , the efficacy of ac@@ tos was studied in tri@@ ple@@ otherapy ; the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin , in addition they received either ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were lowered from 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of an additional dose of ac@@ tos for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ sul@@ phi@@ de in a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values was 0.@@ 94 % , whereas the additional dose of plac@@ ebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study where the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was examined in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients receiving Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin had a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ es@@ thesia ( decreased sensitivity to irrit@@ ation ) .
Ac@@ tos must neither be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one levels - in blood ) .
it was decided that ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients in the sole use of mon@@ otherapy , in which met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited appro@@ ving the marketing of Ac@@ tos in the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and where met@@ form@@ in is un@@ suitable due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
no data is available for use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , therefore the use in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are at risk of at least one risk factor ( e.g. early cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or e@@ dem@@ a , especially those with reduced cardiac reserves .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and o@@ e@@ dem@@ a when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular outcome study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in reports of con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased initial liver enz@@ ym@@ atic values ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if AL@@ T mirrors are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that indicate h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme values must be checked .
the decision to continue the treatment of the patient with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one should be conducted before the clinical assessment before the laboratory parameters .
in clinical trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been demonstrated that can ag@@ grav@@ ate adi@@ pos@@ ity deposits and in some cases associated with a fluid retention .
as a result of h@@ emo@@ di@@ lution , a small reduction of medium hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under the therapy with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one as oral two or three @-@ way combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ otrop@@ ic substance or as a secondary combination therapy with insulin are the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
after the market launch was reported under treatment with thi@@ az@@ ole indi@@ ions , including pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , about an occurrence or deterioration of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a with a reduction of visual acuity .
it is unclear whether there is a direct link between taking Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , but it is advisable to be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a when patients report disorders of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary report of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one
the resulting frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patients years for women treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years for women who were treated with a comparative medi@@ cal@@ ation .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of over 3.5 years of study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years ) compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years ) in patients who were treated with a comparison medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wants a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is to be removed ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies to investigate the interactions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ex@@ erts no relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with drugs that are metaboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase of the AU@@ C of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % reduction in the AU@@ C of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one .
this is due to the fact that the treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces the insulin resistance resulting from pregnancy and reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , individual cases : unknown ( not inv@@ alu@@ able in present data ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ or and refra@@ ction index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical trials with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one AL@@ T asc@@ ents were more than three times the upper limit of the normal range , but less often than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl resin .
in an outcome study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease , the incidence of severe heart failure under pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than plac@@ ebo , if pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one .
since the market launch it has rarely been reported about heart failure under sp@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , but more often when pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summari@@ zing analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in groups treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one treated groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients in patients treated with comparative medi@@ tations .
over a period of 3.5 years of the Pro@@ Active study , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medi@@ al .
in the case of taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days did not appear any symptoms .
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one appears to be activated by activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) , which in the animal model results in increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be shown that pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose level in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ ids as mon@@ otherapy has been carried out over two years in order to investigate the time until after the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time of two years after the start of therapy , blood glucose monitoring ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) was maintained by pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one at 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient with insulin despite three months of optimization was random@@ ized to pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo .
in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , the average H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was 0.@@ 45 % , compared to those who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction of insulin dosage in the treated group treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one was observed .
clinical trials for a year showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in qu@@ oti@@ ents compared to bas@@ eline scores .
the effect of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 diabetes patients .
in most clinical trials compared to plac@@ ebo , a reduction of total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol level as well as slightly , clin@@ ically no significantly increased LD@@ L cholesterol was observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduced total plas@@ m@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ ids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol level .
compared to plac@@ ebo , no statisti@@ cally significant rise in LD@@ L cholesterol was observed in Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , while met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ ids were observed .
in a study of 20 weeks , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one not only reduced the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , both by an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease were random@@ ized into groups who received either pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular treatment .
after oral application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is quickly absorbed , where the peak concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in the plasma are usually achieved within 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV is equivalent to the effectiveness of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , it was demonstrated that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one had no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or reduces the plasma concentration of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
after the oral application of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one in humans the marker was found mainly in the decay ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma elimination time of unchanged pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ite is 16 - 23 hours .
plasma concentrations of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of oral clearance of the mother substance are similar .
toxic@@ ological studies included mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with h@@ emo@@ di@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the fact that the treatment with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one reduces the insulin resistance resulting from the formation and reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( in male rats ) of the ure@@ a epitheli@@ um were induced .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ ole @-@ indi@@ an led to increased frequency of col@@ onic tum@@ ours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the resulting frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patients years for women treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years for women who were treated with a comparative medi@@ cal@@ ation .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of over 3.5 years of study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years ) compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years ) in patients who were treated with a comparison medication .
in another study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with each pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ ids were investigated .
in clinical studies more than 1 year , there was a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine qu@@ oti@@ ents compared to bas@@ eline scores .
in a study of 20 weeks , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one not only reduced the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , both by an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study missed the target with regard to its primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , cor@@ on@@ ary re@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and re@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that with the intake of pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are connected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 45 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one and over 7,@@ 400 patients who received comparative medi@@ cal@@ ation , increased incidence of bone frac@@ tures in women .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was examined in 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancre@@ as is unable to produce insulin and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is unable to effectively use insulin .
the study measured the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c level , indicating that the blood sugar mirrors have been reduced to a similar extent as with another human insulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
the doses of acet@@ one may also be adapted if it is given together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the package bite ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane were out@@ weigh@@ ed in the treatment of diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the European Union .
pre@@ mixed insulin products are normally used once or twice a day , if rapid initial action along with a longer lasting effect is desired .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly by an intensive insulin therapy may change the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change in strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA towards insulin of animal origin ) can lead to a change in the dosage required .
if a dose adjustment is necessary when changing to ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the adjustment .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change of animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or unlike their previous insulin .
before traveling that go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to seek the advice of his doctor as such trips may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore take into account possible interactions during therapy and always ask his patients for other medications that they have taken .
4 B@@ oth hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which may occur in a non @-@ sufficiently controlled diabe@@ tic therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fertility in uter@@ o .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias can lead to un@@ consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es and end with temporary or permanent dys@@ functions of brain function and even death .
disorders of the nervous system Oc@@ ca@@ sional - Periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with discomfort known as acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and usually reversible .
5 An intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with ab@@ rupt improvement in blood sugar levels can , however , be associated with a temporary deterioration of diabe@@ tic retin@@ opathy .
skin disorders and skin tissue damage - Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ rop@@ hi@@ e At the injection point can develop a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy if missed to change the punc@@ ture points within the injection area .

however , hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can develop gradually : • Light hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias can be treated by the oral supply of glucose or sug@@ ary foods .
diabe@@ tics should always have grape sugar@@ s , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juices . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven aid or by glucose which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total active duration is up to 24 hours .
res@@ or@@ ption The res@@ or@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with rapid or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of spl@@ itting ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were taken into consideration ; none of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites formed by the split is active .
based on the conventional studies on safety mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not reveal any particular dangers to humans .

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
moreover , the doses of acet@@ one may need to be adapted if it is given together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar level .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the transport of ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id throughout the European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin fast acting must first be raised , followed by the amount of long @-@ acting insulin .
3 If a dose adjustment is necessary when changing to ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the adjustment .
before traveling that go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to seek the advice of his doctor as such trips may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who are already showing signs of crystalline deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or g@@ out nodes ( &quot; rocks , &quot; i.e. larger pri@@ mor@@ dial crystalline deposits that can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid levels are still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months there may still be rheum@@ atism ; therefore it is recommended that patients with aden@@ ur@@ ic for at least six months continue to use other medicines to prevent g@@ out sei@@ zur@@ es .
the medication is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not studied for these groups .
in the first study , attended by 1,@@ 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the plac@@ ebo ( plac@@ ebo ) and al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol for one year .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was administered at a dose of 300 mg once daily ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / dl during the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who took aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who took once daily 120 mg , in the last three measurements had a urine acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 26@@ 8 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are headache , diarr@@ hea , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver values .
in particular in patients with heart problems in pre@@ history , there may be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but could also have a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to deposits ( including any known or currently available g@@ out node and / or arthritis ) .
if the serum levels of serum levels are still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be taken into account at AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x a day .
for patients with severe kidney function restriction , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated until now ( see Section 5.2 ) .
since there are no experiences with children and adolescents , the use of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended .
organ transplan@@ t recipients Sin@@ ce there are no experiences with organ transplan@@ t recipients , the use of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended ( see section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure , treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other har@@ n@@ acid @-@ cutting medicines , acute toxic@@ ity may occur during the course of the treatment because , by lowering the serum resin , ur@@ inary acid deposits can be mobili@@ zed in the tissue initially .
B. with malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases so far increasing that it comes to a de@@ position in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease Dur@@ ing clinical trials in phase 3 , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to carry out a liver function test before the start of the bas@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ure treatment and in the further course ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ l@@ in tin was not performed any interaction studies to F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line ( a in@@ hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
subjects were the simultaneous administration of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ure ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dosage adjustment for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient used at the same time .
in a study involving subjects , 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily had an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , suggest@@ ing a possible f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at inhibit@@ ing effect on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vivo .
An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acid , containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , delayed the absorption of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( around 1 hour ) and a reduction in C@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C .
pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ an@@ cies cannot be related to side effects of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
animal experimental studies do not include direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic and fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , serving machines or exercising dangerous activities until they can reasonably be sure that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of the cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient @-@ years ) and in long @-@ term extension studies ( 1.4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient @-@ years ) was observed , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .

50@@ 9 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum cre@@ atine values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with ren@@ al impair@@ ment ( D ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage return of serum levels in test subjects , regardless of kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal ren@@ al function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum resin concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl of 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum gum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of study ( bas@@ eline ) .
the data from the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent decrease in serum levels of serum levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients needed 16 @-@ 24 treatment against a g@@ out ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not need treatment against po@@ ison@@ ous feed ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the g@@ out node @-@ size , which in 54 % of patients had a complete dis@@ appearance of the g@@ out nodes by month 24 .
increased TS@@ H@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ g / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose .
for dos@@ ages between 120 mg and 300 mg , a rise in the AU@@ C is observed for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is larger than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max amounts to about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant changes were observed in the percentage decline of serum levels of serum levels if this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent steam @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at lies in the range from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma protein binding of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approx . 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary attachment to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ ols showed that these oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are predominantly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s cur@@ on@@ id is primarily produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ labeled F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose was found in the urine as unchanged F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 30 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gates ( 13 % ) and other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion via urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the stool found itself as unchanged F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , acet@@ yl@@ glu@@ cos@@ amine of the active substance ( 1 % ) , its well @-@ known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gates ( 25 % ) and other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
special patient group ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ max of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change compared to subjects with normal kidney function .
the average total AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by about 1.8 times of 7.5 m g / ml in the group with normal ren@@ al function to 13.@@ 2 μ / h / ml in the group with severe kidney function .

these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ ine metabolism and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
in oral dos@@ ages of up to 48 mg / kg / day , F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a condition where the bones become br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause , where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must not lie down until after the first intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
as al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D3 can already be used separately in medicines approved in the European Union , the company presented data origin@@ ating from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to prove the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of boo@@ sting vitamin D levels .
after a 15 week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels was lower ( 11 % ) compared to those treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE compared to those who took only al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data suggest@@ ing that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dosage contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( digestive disorders ) , ul@@ cer ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) of the es@@ oph@@ agus , dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ gia ( abdominal pain ) , abdominal Ab@@ dom@@ en ( blo@@ ated stomach ) and sour upset .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D3 or any of the other ingredients .
it may not be used in diseases of o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand upright or sit for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd to appro@@ ve the launch of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE throughout the European Union .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE can only be taken with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
the following indications are to be observed precisely in order to reduce the risk of valve ha@@ ired irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day . • The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or let the tablet dissolve in the mouth because there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • The patients should not present themselves before the first intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract except for p@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y ( see section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stro@@ kes , were reported in patients taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( some of them were severe and require hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible malign@@ ant reactions , and patients should be advised to stop the medicine after symptoms of malign@@ ant irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ active pain , or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn and seek medical advice ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects appears to be elevated in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or continue taking it after the occurrence of symptoms that indicate an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .

oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , usually associated with tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapy regi@@ men predominantly intraven@@ ous administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate .
there are no data available that indicate whether the removal of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who require a jaw surgery reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw .
the clinical assessment of the attending physician is decisive for therapy planning for each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be instructed to take a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE to take the tablet in the next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after having noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but will continue taking one tablet a week as planned for the day of the week intended for this purpose .
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated adequately before starting the therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids , and some oral medicines may affect the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if they are taken at the same time .
therefore , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not conducted , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs , without any clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for the application in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or by breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most of the reports stem from cancer patients , but it was also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .
nevertheless , measures of serum calcium to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum - phosph@@ ats up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in both treatment groups with similar incidence .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate In@@ follow an oral over@@ dose may occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .

the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were investigated in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) and in the frac@@ ture intervention study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .

in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the BM@@ D of the BM@@ D of the spine and the Tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to uph@@ old ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was maintained .
fit consisted of two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials in which Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 m@@ g. a day for 2 years and then 10 mg daily , either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily dose of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at reduced the occurrence of at least one new ed@@ dy frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % compared to plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
res@@ or@@ ption Based on an intraven@@ ous reference dose , the medi@@ an oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women was 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after noc@@ tur@@ nal fasting and two hours before receiving a standardised breakfast .
bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % if Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken one or half an hour before a standardised breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first food or drink of the day .
in healthy subjects the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically meaningful changes in the oral bio availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the mean range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies in rats have shown that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at is distributed temporarily in soft tissue after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly circul@@ ates into the bone or is ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion After IV administration of a single dose of 14@@ C al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , about 50 % of the radioactive substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the decay .
according to IV administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was 71 ml / min and systemic clearance did not exceed 200 ml / min .
in rats , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the aci@@ dic or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines by these transport systems .

agra@@ f is administered to adult patients who have transplan@@ ted a kidney or liver in order to prevent rejection of transplan@@ ted organs by the immune system .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already being used in the EU , the company has presented the results of previously conducted trials with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplantation , compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rejected after a period of treatment ( for example , by examining how often a new organ transplan@@ t or resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
in addition , shorter further studies on 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplantation were conducted and examined , as Adv@@ ate@@ f is absorbed by the body in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes to immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
clin@@ ically relevant differences in the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including sub@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; conver@@ sions of the formulation or the ré@@ gi@@ me should only be carried out under close supervision of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of a switch to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic pharmaceutical supervision and corresponding dose adjustment must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact .
the dosage of Adv@@ ans@@ f should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood @-@ level determin@@ ations ( see below ) Recommen@@ dations
after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ entur@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Val@@ ues should be checked before the conversion and over two weeks after conversion .
on Day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as valley level , was comparable with both form@@ ulations in both ni@@ b and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ king are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under agra@@ f to ensure adequate substance exposure during the immediate post @-@ transplan@@ t phase .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a low @-@ clear substance , an adjustment of the dose can take several days before the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the condition of the patient does not allow oral consumption of medicines in the first postoperative period , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion fluid ) can be initiated with a dose of ca .
duration of use In order to supp@@ ress gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be indicated .
dosage recommendations - kidney transplantation Pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The oral Adv@@ ance therapy should start at 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a once daily dose in the morning .
further dose adaptation may be necessary later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change during the course of the stabili@@ zation of the patient after the transplan@@ t .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The oral Adv@@ ance therapy should start at 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a once daily dose in the morning .
dosage recommendation - Con@@ version from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ entur@@ f M@@ ust a transplan@@ t receiver of twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to be changed to a once daily intake of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules , this conversion has to take place in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose .
after a change from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to Adv@@ oc@@ ate once a day , the treatment must begin with the oral initi@@ als dose recommended in ren@@ al and liver transplantation for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection .
heart transplantation In adult patients who are switched to advance , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once a day .
other transplan@@ t recipients though there is no clinical experience with an oral , pancre@@ atic and col@@ on transplan@@ ted patient , was performed in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , for pancre@@ atic patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dosage adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood levels in the targeted area may require a reduction of the dose in patients with severe liver function disorders .
patients with reduced kidney function Sin@@ ce the ren@@ al function does not influence the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not necessary .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of serum cre@@ atine level , calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine in the urine , and monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
change@@ over from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ ph When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy , caution is required ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations for full blood pressure in full blood The dose should be based first and foremost on the clinical assessment of re@@ pul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual cases , taking full @-@ blood @-@ tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ tal@@ c controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus test level during the first two weeks after transplantation followed by peri@@ odic controls during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ Tal@@ king levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled by pro@@ gra@@ f to advance , dose adjustment , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or simultaneous use of substances that might alter the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ ate@@ f is a medicine with a low clearance , adap@@ tations of the dose may take several days before the Ste@@ ady State has entered .
the data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood level in the blood does not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the levels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in full blood in the first time after liver transplan@@ tations usually lie in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used .
this has led to serious adverse events including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects which may occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus sub@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; conver@@ sions of the formulation or the ré@@ gi@@ me should only be carried out under close supervision of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be refrac@@ tory to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation advance .
there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ ance for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and gra@@ ft recipients .
due to possible interactions that can lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the consumption of herbal supplements , the St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other plant remedies can be avoided during treatment with Adv@@ ance ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diarr@@ ho@@ ea a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is required , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances .
in rare cases a chamber or sep@@ tum hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e described as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was to be observed under Pro@@ gra@@ f , which can therefore occur under agra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical interference are an already existing heart disease , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ load and e@@ dem@@ a .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or ultra@@ violet light should be restricted due to the potential risk of malign@@ ant skin l@@ esi@@ ons by suitable clothing or use of a sun protection device with a high protection factor .
if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms of PRE@@ S such as headache , altered state of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and blur@@ red vision , should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
as advoc@@ ate hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded , lac@@ tose contained , special caution is required in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary g@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can influence the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and consequently increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
therefore , it is recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels with the simultaneous addition of substances that can alter the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dosage accordingly for maintaining even concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly distinctive interaction was achieved with an@@ tim@@ y@@ co@@ tics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the macro@@ li@@ de antibiotic er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies revealed that the rise in blood levels results mainly from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hibition ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines which are metaboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect their metabolism .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase the level of hormone exposition , it is especially cau@@ tious to make decisions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures .
the results of animal studies have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can potentially l@@ essen the clear@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and pro@@ long its half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients have no indication that under tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in comparison to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in the case of uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( in particular regarding its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a new@@ born hyp@@ er ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the side effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants is often not exactly determined because of the patient &apos;s disease and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
in the following , the side effects are listed according to their frequency in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .

infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases As is well known among other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , patients who are treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are often increased suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ co@@ tic , prot@@ o@@ zo@@ al ) .
cases of BK @-@ Virus associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ k@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy , including treatment with lawyers .
it was reported on ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ma including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative disorders and skin tum@@ ours associated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus therapy .
due to its high molecular weight , low water solu@@ bility and the high binding of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ tic .
the action mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on the molecular level are likely to medi@@ ate the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus through its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ole protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the nucle@@ us .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ related im@@ itation of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes genes .

175 l@@ ung@@ ed patients , 4@@ 75 patients undergoing pancre@@ atitis , were used in 6@@ 30 cases following col@@ on transplantation as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant .
overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies outlined the observations in the large studies where pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients .
lung transplantation in an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multic@@ entre study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was reported over 110 patients who received either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in within a 1 : 1 random@@ ization .
chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ans@@ - syndrome , was less common in the first year after the transplan@@ t ( 2,@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it came in 21.@@ 7 % of the cases of the development of bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be switched to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were switched from tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , An@@ n Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which no acute transplan@@ t rejection occurred was greater after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the lung transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in a study , the frequency of the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ated syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
pancre@@ atic Plan@@ tation A multic@@ entre study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was conducted on 205 patients who underwent a pancre@@ atic and kidney transplantation following a random@@ ised procedure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initi@@ al@@ dose ( per protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then achieved to reach the desired valley level from 8 to 15 ng / ml on the 5th .
the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study of or@@ ally pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive after intestinal transplan@@ ts showed an up@@ dat@@ ory survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as a low ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the dis@@ connected fraction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or a reinforcement of the metabolism brought about by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids are intended to be responsible for the higher Clear@@ ance rates observed after the transplan@@ t .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely metaboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion occurs mainly via the bile .
for stable patients who were converted from Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) to the dose of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) relative to the total daily dose , systemic exposure to Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus test level during the first two weeks after transplantation followed by peri@@ odic controls during maintenance therapy .
21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be therapy @-@ resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation advance .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical interference are an already existing heart disease , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ load and e@@ dem@@ a .
28 confirmed cases of ab@@ duction amounted to 3@@ 2.6 % in the first 24 weeks of the Adv@@ ance Group ( N = 2@@ 37 ) and 29.@@ 3 % in the Pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 34 ) .

adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( a con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether adv@@ ate is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , causing bleeding problems such as bleeding in the joints , muscles or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but is produced according to a method called re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to enable it to form the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II .
adv@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union called Recom@@ bin@@ ate , but is produced otherwise , so that the drug does not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , including a study involving 53 children under six years , the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures .
in the main study , the efficacy of adv@@ ate in the prevention of bleeding was assessed in 86 % of 510 new ble@@ ed@@ ings with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common side effects of adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies to factor VI@@ II .
adv@@ ate may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein , or any of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG approval for the marketing of Adv@@ oc@@ ates throughout the European Union .
dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of factor VI@@ II deficiency , the location and extent of bleeding and the patient &apos;s clinical condition .
in the following ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ages , factor VI@@ II activity should not fall below the indicated plasma levels ( in % of the norm or in I.@@ E. / dl ) during the corresponding period .
inj@@ ections every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute depression are removed .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk for the patient is over .
during the treatment course , appropriate determination of factor VI@@ II plasma levels is recommended for controlling the dose to be administered and the frequency of inj@@ ections .
individual patients may differ in their response to factor VI@@ II , various in vivo recovery and have different half @-@ lives .
3 pro@@ phyla@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activity is not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled at a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out in order to detect an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered .
the dose rate should depend on the patient &apos;s condition whereby a maximum dose rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VI@@ II is a well known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by means of modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to factor VI@@ II , where the risk within the first 20 exposure days is the largest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an@@ am@@ n@@ estic known inhibit@@ or development , after switching from re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II @-@ product to another , the recur@@ r@@ ence of ( low @-@ tri@@ gen ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
because of the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women there are no experiences about the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s were inhibit@@ ors against Factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all of which occurred in previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of formation of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of each patient ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II spi@@ eg@@ els was performed post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10th - 14th post surgery ) in a patient with continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained during the whole period and the factor VI@@ II@@ - mirror in the plasma and the Clear@@ ance @-@ Rate once again showed sufficient values again on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 145 children and adults 2 with a diagnosed serious to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient after 26 exposure days with A@@ DV@@ ATE showed a low inhibit@@ or@@ ti@@ ter ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .
in addition , none of 53 pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) were detected with a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) .
in previously untreated patients with an ongoing clinical study 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients with factor VI@@ II .
the immune response of patients to traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by investigating the antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as an ongoing peak of the antibody level against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , otherwise no signs or symptoms occurred that were indic@@ ative of an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the incidence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , skin rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hili@@ c gran@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study .

based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefits risk assessment as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of the security profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which necess@@ it@@ ates a filing of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years .
December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited approved the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) officially that the company accepts its application for the marketing of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the chest , the brain , the bones or the soft parts ( tissues that connect and support other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified to carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that has been altered in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors , enabling cancer cells to re @-@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein produced from the non @-@ defective p@@ 53 gene is normally used to restore damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered .
in the case of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , in which the p@@ 53 @-@ gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can grow and share .
the company presented data from a study with a patient with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the under@@ belly area , in the bones and in the brain .
after the CH@@ MP had examined the company &apos;s answers to the questions he asked , some questions were still unclear .
based on the examination of the initial submitted documents , the CH@@ MP draws on a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore brings benefits to patients .
the committee also had concerns about the treatment of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable manner and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not inform CH@@ MP about whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Com@@ passionate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed drug release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are composed so that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( ha@@ y fever , inflammation of the nose path@@ ways caused by poll@@ en ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cous membrane swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and young people aged 12 and over , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken with or without food with a glass of water .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and end once the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( blocked nose ) , are cla@@ d .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose .
the main impact was the changes in the sever@@ ity of the ha@@ y fever symptoms reported by the patients before the commen@@ cement of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients had their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
considering all ha@@ y symptoms except con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose , the patients reported that the aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze increased by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared with 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients who received pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine on their own .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients under aer@@ a@@ a@@ ze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who consumed Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ ase ) , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ pation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against the adren@@ ergi@@ c active agents or Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) .
aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze may also not be used in patients who suffer from hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , heart or vascular diseases including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ tension ) or a ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the Company SP Europe approval for the transport of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze across the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water but can be swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without breaking , breaking or ch@@ ewing ) .
aer@@ a@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years because of the lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application should be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have ended .
it is recommended to limit the duration of application to 10 days , as long @-@ term application can decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time .
after decreasing the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as mon@@ otherapy .
since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors or within 2 weeks of the end of such therapy .
this is attributable to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , per@@ go@@ li@@ de , hydro@@ chl@@ oric acid , cab@@ erg@@ olin , d@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ gen@@ az@@ oline , n@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient population and the data is not sufficient to provide appropriate dosage recommendations .
safety and efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is insufficient to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that the treatment must be reduced in case of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as headache or strengthening of the head@@ aches ) .
patients with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck , or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ a@@ a@@ ze is to be deposited at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines can otherwise prevent positive reactions on skin reactions or reduce them to their extent .
in the course of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , in which er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole was additionally given , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
in the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor test there were no significant differences between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the plac@@ ebo @-@ treated patients regardless of whether or not it was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines can not be completely ruled out .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in @-@ vivo and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is .
the safety of the use of aer@@ a@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured ; experience gained from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies has , however , no increase in the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
as reproduction studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ a@@ a@@ ze should not be used during pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to a di@@ zz@@ iness , which may lead to impair@@ ment of traffic , or the ability to operate machinery .
the symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ ne@@ a , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ ose , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible tablets .
headache , anxiety , difficult mic@@ tion , muscle weakness , and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , tran@@ spir@@ ation , nausea , vom@@ iting , pre@@ st@@ ernal pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , blur@@ red vision and hyp@@ ot@@ ony .
CN@@ S stimulation is particularly prob@@ able in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( dry mouth , pup@@ illary rigi@@ dity and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesion molecule P @-@ Selec@@ tor to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose trial with adults , D@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dose of 5 m@@ g. a day showed no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo .
the oral application of Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic effects such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of a CN@@ S arous@@ al .
1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 were involved with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic activity of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher on the basis of the overall score for the symptoms ( except nas@@ al mu@@ cous membrane swelling ) , significantly higher than under a pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine mon@@ otherapy over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aerobic tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined on the basis of nas@@ al mu@@ cous membrane swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aerobic tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city eth@@ ni@@ city .
as part of a single dose study of the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in the plasma .
following the per@@ oral application of aerobic with healthy volunteers for 14 days , the body weight of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached in day 10 .
within the framework of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dos@@ sier study carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects were poor@@ ly metaboli@@ zed .
a component interaction study shows that the exposure to Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) from Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was bio @-@ equivalent to exposure to an aer@@ of@@ a@@ ze tablet .
however , based on the conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
in March 2007 and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 the pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance system described in the application for authorisation is established and works before and during the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the relief of the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s substance , its effect .
aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets allevi@@ ate symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( ha@@ y fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ chy nose and so@@ othing or it@@ chy eyes while con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose .
20 Under certain circumstances , you may be particularly sensitive to the mu@@ cous membrane of the anti@@ sp@@ ell@@ ant drug , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , which is included in this medicine .
( diabetes ) , a sten@@ o@@ zing stomach ul@@ cer ( ul@@ cer that leads to nar@@ rowing of the stomach , the small intest@@ ine or the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus ) , a bladder neck release , bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the medical history ( difficulty due to a conv@@ ocation of the lung mus@@ cul@@ ature ) , a prostate enlargement or problems with the liver , kidneys or bladder .
inform your doctor if you encounter or diagnose the following symptoms or diseases when applying Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : • High blood pressure • heart ch@@ ase , heart pal@@ pit@@ ations • heart rhythm disorders • nausea and head@@ aches , or a strengthening of existing head@@ aches .
if you are taking Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines please tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
air@@ ti@@ ghtness and the use of machines In the recommended dosage , it is not to be expected that aer@@ ob@@ atics will lead to di@@ zz@@ iness or reduce the attention .

it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 m@@ g@@ - and 5 mg melt tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake .
for children between 1 and 5 years , the dose is 1,@@ 25 mg once a day , in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or .
for children between 6 and 11 years , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or w .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four trials of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies of patients who also had asthma ) .
the efficacy was measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ ru@@ ped , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance in the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been submitted to prove that the body analyzes the sy@@ rup , the solution to intake and the tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of the symptom scores ( symptom score ) of 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients who received a plac@@ ebo .
in both cases of ur@@ tic@@ aria , the number of symptoms after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % , was compared to those treated with plac@@ ebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union .
one tablet once a day , with or without a meal , for allevi@@ ating the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical trials on efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous disease procedure and can be terminated after the symptoms have been delayed and re @-@ recorded in their re@@ occurring .
in case of persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) the patient can be recommended during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets , in which er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to di@@ zz@@ iness , which may lead to impair@@ ment of air@@ ti@@ ghtness or the ability to operate machinery .
in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo .
the most common adverse events reported more frequently than plac@@ ebo were ti@@ redness ( 1.2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 adolescents aged 12 to 17 was the most common side effect of head@@ aches , which occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and at 6.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose trial , in which up to 45 mg of lor@@ et@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) were administered .
this includes both inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesion molecule P @-@ Selec@@ tor to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a clinical study with multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( which nine times the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , there was no longer an extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in a single dos@@ is@@ - study involving adults , D@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can alternatively be divided into allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , depending on the duration of the symptoms .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s are defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persist@@ ing allergic rh@@ initi@@ s are defined as the occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as shown on the overall score of the questionn@@ aires for quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , irrespective of eti@@ ology , is similar in the different forms and can be recru@@ ited pro@@ spec@@ tively chronic patients .
since hist@@ amine release is a caus@@ al factor for all ur@@ tic@@ ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n will also lead to an improvement in symptoms in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and reducing the size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ c in chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines was excluded from the study .
an improvement of the it@@ ching rate by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wak@@ ef@@ ulness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patient demo@@ s were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant accumulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely ruled out

in a single dos@@ is@@ study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg meals ( fatty , calorie rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies carried out with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profiles of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on the conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , for allevi@@ ating the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years of age are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there are no data that support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with am@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin tests should also play a role in the diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of age metaboli@@ ze Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience a higher substance load ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years that are fully metaboli@@ zed is identical to those with children who are normal metaboli@@ zing .
this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients should not take this medicine with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ ase is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not established in the context of clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall incidence of adverse events in children from 2 to 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group as in the plac@@ ebo group .
in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study involving adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of lor@@ et@@ adi@@ n ( nine times a clinical dose ) .
children between 1 and 11 years of age who were eligible for anti @-@ hist@@ amine therapy received a daily mean dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
in a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied for ten days in adults , there was no longer an extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical studies , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to plac@@ ebo was observed .
at a single daily dose of 7.5 mg A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials did not cause any impair@@ ment of psych@@ om@@ otor activity .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol prevented neither an increase in alcohol @-@ induced performance injury nor an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .

when taking A@@ eri@@ us processed tablet together with food and beverages A@@ eri@@ us processed tablet does not need to be taken with water or any other liquid .
if you forgot your dose of A@@ eri@@ us processed tablet If you forgot to take your dose in time , take it as soon as possible and then follow the normal treatment plan .
after the market launch of A@@ eri@@ us very rarely has been reported cases of severe allergic reactions ( difficulty breathing , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) and skin rash .
A@@ eri@@ us use is indicated for children between 1 and 11 years old , adolescents ( 12 years and older ) and adults , older people included .
if the solution involves inser@@ ting an application sy@@ ringe for application with sc@@ aling , you can alternatively use it to take the appropriate amount of solution to take in .
regarding the duration of the treatment your doctor will determine the type of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s you suffer from and will determine how long you should take A@@ eri@@ us &apos;s solution .
however , in children under 2 years of diarr@@ ho@@ ea , fever and in@@ som@@ nia , frequent side effects were often reported as plac@@ ebo in adults , dry mouth and headache .
97 A@@ eri@@ us plug @-@ in solution is available in bottles with child @-@ safe closing cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .
the 150 ml packaging size is a measuring spoon or an application sy@@ ringe f@@ û@@ r preparations for use with sc@@ aling of 2.5 m@@ l@@ - and 5 ml doses .
June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. informed the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) that the company has withdrawn its application for the marketing of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of avi@@ aries H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influ@@ enza caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from man to person , because people do not yet have immunity ( no protection ) on the other hand .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the flu virus in the vaccine as &quot; foreign @-@ foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system is able to make antibodies faster in contact with a flu virus of this tribe .
subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface which detects the human body as foreign ) was puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine .
an inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
the scope of the clinical data basis for ass@@ essing the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
if you are participating in a clinical trial and need further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor .
for further information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines to treat adults and children over four years that are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , as@@ gen@@ ase is available as a solution for intake , but this cannot be taken together with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination has not been studied .
A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed when the doctor has checked which an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines the patient has taken before , and the lik@@ el@@ ihood of the virus to respond to the drug .
the recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines .
in children between 4 and 12 years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gen@@ ase is based on body weight .
in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines , A@@ gener@@ el reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
not to cure AIDS , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS .
A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
it was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who used prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who used a low dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the viral load change after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , after 48 weeks under as@@ gen@@ ase , more patients had a viral load below 400 copies / ml than plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but only very few of the children were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
in the study with adults who formerly had been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors the drug A@@ gener@@ ase increased the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it came under as@@ gen@@ ase along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r for a stronger drop in the viral load after four weeks as with the patients who continued their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common A@@ gen@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( diarr@@ hea ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , skin rash and fatigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
A@@ gener@@ asis may also not be used in patients , St. John &apos;s Wort ( an herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines that are de@@ composed in the same way as A@@ gen@@ ase and in high concentrations in the blood are harmful to health .
as with other medicines for HIV , there is a risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune activation syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years were out@@ weigh@@ ed against the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee stated that the benefit of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously taken no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; since only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited for the launching of A@@ gen@@ ase in the European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ treated adults and children aged 4 and over .
usually aspir@@ ation capsules for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sters of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should be administered together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ el capsules and solution for taking on one milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram are not ex@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily , along with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
2 If A@@ gener@@ el capsules are used without the intensi@@ fying addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses of ag@@ it@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) need to be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ gen@@ ase in combination with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not studied in children .
A@@ gener@@ asis is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders 300 mg twice daily .
con@@ current use should be treated with care in patients with mild or moderate liver function disorder , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ asis may not be used simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also medi@@ ate the medi@@ ums of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzymes 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r while taking amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ el or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ asis does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , A@@ generic drugs should be used together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious liver damage with potentially le@@ thal outcome .
for the case of simultaneous an@@ tivi@@ ral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant specialist information of these medicines .
patients with pre @-@ existing reduced liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show increased incidence of liver dysfunction under anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gen@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , which are metaboli@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including mor@@ bus Cus@@ hing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
as the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of A@@ gen@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended due to the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
in patients taking this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ asis may be less effective due to the reduced plasma levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
because of the possibility of metabolic interactions with amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , however , the information is insufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for op@@ ium withdrawal symptoms , especially if low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be administered .
because of the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col content of the A@@ gener@@ el solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under the age of four and should be used with caution on certain other patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be terminated in the duration of 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , or an exac@@ er@@ bation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases that were necessary for therapy to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B . higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and related metabolic disorders .
in the case of hem@@ mop@@ hili@@ c patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis occur .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can develop at the time of initi@@ ating an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , leading to serious clinical conditions or wor@@ sen@@ ing symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ torial a@@ eti@@ ology is believed ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrate with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also medi@@ ate the medi@@ ums of the P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ syndrome 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrates with a low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be combined with drugs whose active ingredients are metaboli@@ zed mainly via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
in the attempt to balance the reduced plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often adverse effects on the liver were observed .
St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient has already used St. John &apos;s wort , the blood pressure levels are and , if possible , to check the viral load and to susp@@ end the St. John &apos;s Wort .
dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not required when nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50 % increased , for C@@ max , by contrast , by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered .
in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r were used twice a day and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment regi@@ men .
52 % ab@@ duc@@ ted when amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma that have been reached in the combination of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) are given twice daily in combination with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , a close monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was performed to use A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in &apos;s imagin@@ ative component it is recommended that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , dose adaptation is not required .
treatment with f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
the effects of ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and available limited data suggest that ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may reduce the serum concentration of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
be careful if these medicines should be used at the same time because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
caution is required if these medicines are used together ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out , as an exact predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous administration of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentrations ( AU@@ C ) of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in a rise in the side effects associated with ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin will be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with as@@ gen@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin were not performed , but the plasma levels of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ car@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day led to an increase of the C@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to the value , which was observed after 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day without con@@ current application of fossi@@ ls avi@@ r with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines listed below , including substrates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may possibly result in interactions with A@@ gener@@ asis .
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions that are associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with as@@ gen@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors it is advisable that ant@@ acids should not be taken at the same time as as@@ gen@@ ase since it can lead to res@@ or@@ ption disturbances .
the simultaneous use of anti @-@ conv@@ ul@@ sives , known as enzyme @-@ induc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ eli@@ pin , Nic@@ ardi@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ stri@@ di@@ pin and ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased 10 by amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these medicines .
con@@ current consumption with A@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and strengthen associated side effects with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , the fluor@@ o@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels rose significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous addition of A@@ gen@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
in H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases in plasma levels are expected at the same time administration of A@@ gener@@ asis .
as plasma @-@ level increases in these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors lead to my@@ opathy , including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of these pharmaceuticals is not recommended with amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirrors is recommended , as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased while simultaneously offering amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore A@@ gener@@ ase should not be used together with oral mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while con@@ current use of A@@ gen@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is advisable .
data for the simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am by 3 to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for op@@ ium withdrawal symptoms , especially if low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be administered .
because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation to be given how to adapt the amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r dose if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered with meth@@ ad@@ one at the same time .
with con@@ current administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gen@@ ase an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore also alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended .
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended with con@@ current administration of A@@ gener@@ asis ( see section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful weighing of the potential benefits for the mother compared to possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk of lac@@ tation rats , amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk in people .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered from the ni@@ st@@ ination into the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of 12 body weight during breast@@ feeding .
the further development of offspring , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal .
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s safety was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most adverse events associated with A@@ gen@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , early on and rarely used for treatment .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are related to taking A@@ gener@@ ase or another medicine used to treat HIV , or whether they are a consequence of the disease .
most of the side effects listed below stem from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication and appeared in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as in the treatment occurring laboratory changes ( degree 3 to 4 ) are listed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and fa@@ ther@@ al sub@@ cut@@ aneous fat tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of breasts and thor@@ ac@@ ic fat accumulation ( stit@@ ches ) .
among 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral @-@ treated individuals who had been treated with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r in combination with L@@ ami@@ v@@ ud@@ din / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ din for a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( stit@@ ches ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed .
in the PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 study , 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - treated patients under Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) showed up to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients with in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s for a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
ras@@ hes were usually mild to moder@@ ately pronounced , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or macro@@ por@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred normally during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment having to be stopped with amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can develop at the time of initi@@ ating an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients receiving 600@@ mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily with low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and frequency of adverse events ( Grade 3 and 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were observed very frequently in patients who received aspir@@ ation together with low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of an over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of in@@ to@@ xi@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the process of viral G@@ ag@@ - and g@@ ag @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ protein prec@@ urs@@ ors with the result of a formation of non @-@ infectious , non @-@ infectious viral particles .
an@@ tivi@@ ral activity of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ ory concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0,@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells .
the connection between the activity of HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and inhibit@@ ing HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans has not yet been defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral un@@ pre@@ treated patients with currently approved fossi@@ ls / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ dos@@ ages - as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ based treatment regi@@ mens with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations were rarely observed .
in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral @-@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg of fossi@@ ls per 100@@ mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates being gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of 13 out of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 patients who were not treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults .

gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used to estimate the activity of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or fossi@@ ls avi@@ r / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ car@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of the mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , or I@@ 50@@ V , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , L@@ 33@@ F , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / G , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M .
the conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns can be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always approach current interpretation systems to analyse the results of resistance tests .
based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used in combination with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or fossi@@ ls avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( separ@@ ators ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of resistance tests .
each of these four genetic samples associated with reduced sensitivity to amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r produces a certain cross @-@ resistance to rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains however generally preserved .
there are currently data on the cross @-@ resistance between amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 F@@ ossi@@ les@@ h@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral @-@ treated patients , in whom a fossi@@ ls @-@ containing formula failed ( one of which showed resistance against Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
vice versa , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
premature termination of a preventive therapy is recommended in order to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations , which can adver@@ sely affect the subsequent treatment .
the efficacy of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which with PI pre@@ treated adults following vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ o@@ side alog@@ a ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the partial study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis showed the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ loss threshold of 0.4 lo@@ 10 copies / ml .
the efficacy of un@@ bi@@ ased ag@@ it@@ asis is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of whom 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , aspir@@ ation solution for intake and capsules in dos@@ ages of 15 mg / kg was examined three times a day , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily .
the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gen@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients en@@ rolled in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on this data , the anticipated benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aspir@@ ation should be considered in the therapy optimisation of children treated with PI . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral dosing , the average duration ( T@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
raised 50@@ 8 % , by contrast , by 30 % for C@@ max while Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease of the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosing ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the steady state ( C@@ min , ss ) remained unaffected by food intake , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg for a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ obstruc@@ ted penetration of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active ingredient in the plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bound amm@@ uni@@ tion , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound amm@@ uni@@ tion remains constant , the percentage of the free active component fluctu@@ ates throughout the dosing interval depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines which in@@ duce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or inhi@@ bit a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrate must be administered with caution when given at the same time with as@@ gen@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gen@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily secre@@ tion of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r is out of the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , as@@ gen@@ ase solution and ag@@ it@@ ase capsules are not replac@@ eable on a milli@@ gram @-@ basis .
the ren@@ al clearance of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also negli@@ gible , therefore the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction should be low on the elimination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment regi@@ mens lead to amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ plasma levels comparable to those obtained from healthy subjects after a dose of 1200 mg of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without con@@ current administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity of mice and rats in male animals ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas in dos@@ ages that were similar to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.8 @-@ fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data to humans , both from clinical trials and from the therapeutic application .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vitro and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacter@@ i@@ ological reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , ampl@@ itude was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical everyday life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients has yet been observed in clinical trials , either during ad@@ minist@@ ering or after the end of the treatment .
studies on the toxic@@ ity of young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to therapeutic dos@@ ages in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ me and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed that indicate a delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ el capsules are used without the intensi@@ fying addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses of ag@@ it@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) need to be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
con@@ current use should be treated with caution in patients with low or slight h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction ; in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be terminated in the long term 27 if a skin rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and related metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50 % increased , for C@@ max , by contrast , by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma that have been reached in the combination of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) are given twice daily in combination with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , a close monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
treatment with f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
caution is required if these medicines are used together ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out , as an exact predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin will be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ eli@@ pin , Nic@@ ardi@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ stri@@ di@@ pin and ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by amp@@ ou@@ pin , thus increasing the activity and toxic@@ ity of these medicines .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , the fluor@@ o@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels rose significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
with con@@ current administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gen@@ ase an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0,@@ 0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) resulted in a decrease of the AU@@ C and C@@ min of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful weighing of the potential benefits for the mother compared to the potential risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered from the ni@@ st@@ ination into the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during breast@@ feeding .
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s safety was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in case of an over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of in@@ to@@ xi@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .
an@@ tivi@@ ral activity of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ ory concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0,@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
vice versa , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on these data , the anticipated benefits of &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; aspir@@ ation should be taken into account in the therapy optimisation of children treated with PI .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound amm@@ uni@@ tion remains constant , the percentage of the free active component fluctu@@ ates throughout the dosing interval depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .

the ren@@ al clearance of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also negli@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction should be low on the elimination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity of mice and rats in male animals ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas were observed in dos@@ ages that correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.8 @-@ fold ( rat ) of the exposure to humans after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ zel@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .

studies on the toxic@@ ity of young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that in young the metabolic path@@ ways are not fully mature , so that amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) .
A@@ generic solution for intake is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ treated adults and children aged 4 and over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the benefits of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; b@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aspir@@ ation solution for entry has not been proven either in patients treated with PI or pre @-@ treated patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ el capsules and solution for taking on one milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram are not ex@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should , once they are able to swal@@ low the capsules , stop taking the solution to take it ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for aspir@@ ation solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , as no dose recommendation can be given for simultaneous use of A@@ gen@@ ase solution to take and low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although a dose adjustment for amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gen@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in patients with ren@@ al failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of high propylene gly@@ col content , aspir@@ ation solution is contra@@ indicated in infants and children under 4 years of age , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
con@@ current administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these medicines and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects like ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ el or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ asis does not prevent the risk of 47 of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be terminated in the long term if a skin rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in the case of hem@@ mop@@ hili@@ c patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis occur .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50 % increased , for C@@ max , by contrast , by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered .
con@@ current consumption with A@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and increase associated side @-@ effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
based on the data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected .
the potential risk for the human being is not known . because of possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the contained propylene gly@@ col , it should not be used during pregnancy ( see section 4.3 ) .
in the milk of lac@@ tation rats , amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk in people .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the ni@@ st@@ ination in the uter@@ us to the end of the shut@@ down of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of 55 body weight during breast@@ feeding .
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s safety was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are related to taking A@@ gener@@ ase or another medicine used to treat HIV , or whether they are a consequence of the disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral un@@ pre@@ treated patients with currently approved fossi@@ ls / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ dos@@ ages - as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ based treatment regi@@ mens with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations were rarely observed .
premature termination of a more se@@ eding 60 therapy is recommended in order to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations , which can adver@@ sely affect the subsequent treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 62 Based on this data , the anticipated benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aspir@@ ation should be considered in the therapy optimisation of children treated with PI . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows a large ve@@ to volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .

if you have any further questions , please contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . − This medicine was prescribed for you personally .
it can harm other people even if they have the same discomfort as you . − If any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this utility information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
your doctor will normally instruc@@ t you to apply A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to enhance the effect of ag@@ it@@ ase .
the use of A@@ gener@@ asis will be based on the individual viral resistance test carried out by your doctor and your treatment history .
tell your doctor if you are suffering from one of the above @-@ mentioned diseases or take any of the above medications .
if your doctor has advised that you take A@@ gener@@ el capsules along with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r for strengthening the effect ( boo@@ sting ) , make sure that you have read the instructions for Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r carefully before starting the treatment .
there are also no sufficient information to recommend the use of A@@ gener@@ el capsules along with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r for ampli@@ fication in children aged 4 to 12 years or in general in patients under 50 kg body weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore it is important that you read the section &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; When taking A@@ gener@@ ase with other medicines &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you start taking A@@ gener@@ asis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you may need additional factor VI@@ II to control the tendency of bleeding . − In patients who receive anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , re@@ distribution , accumulation or loss of body fat may occur .

it is recommended that HIV positive women should not breast @-@ feed their children under any circumstances in order to avoid transmission of HIV .
air@@ ti@@ ghtness and operation of machines There were no studies on the influence of ag@@ it@@ ase on the driving capability or the ability to operate machinery .
please take this medicine only after consultation with your doctor if it is known that you suffer from intoler@@ ance to certain sugar@@ s .
if you take Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , it is advisable that you take this more than one hour before or after aspir@@ ase , otherwise the effects of A@@ gener@@ ase can be reduced .
dose of A@@ gen@@ ase capsules is 600 mg twice daily , along with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
if your doctor decides that taking k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not suitable for you , you will need to take higher doses ( 1200 mg of amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
85 It is very important that you take the entire daily dose that your doctor has prescribed for you .
if you have taken a larger amount of A@@ gener@@ ase than you should have taken If you have taken more than the prescribed dose of A@@ gener@@ asis , you should contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately .

headache , fatigue , diarr@@ hea , feeling of illness , vom@@ iting , flat@@ ul@@ ence skin rash ( redness , bli@@ sters or it@@ ching ) - occasionally the rash may be of serious nature and force you to stop taking this medicine .
this can include fat loss of legs , arms and face , fat increase in the abdom@@ en and in other inner organs , breast aug@@ mentation and fat grow@@ ths in the neck ( &quot; bul@@ ging &quot; ) .
the other ingredients are propylene gly@@ col , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ( polyethylene gly@@ col 400 ) , To@@ co@@ fer@@ sol@@ an ( TP@@ GS ) , ac@@ es@@ ul@@ f@@ am potassium , sodium chlori@@ de , artificial ch@@ ewing gum aroma , natural pep@@ per@@ mint , cit@@ ric acid , sodium cit@@ rate di@@ hydr@@ ate , puri@@ fied water .
the application frequency and duration of the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated : • Al@@ dar@@ a can be applied three times a week in case of case war@@ ts in the genital area . • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , it can be applied three times a week during one or two weeks of treatment , with four weeks gap between the treatment cycles .
apply the cream to the affected areas of the skin before bed@@ time so that it will remain on the skin for a long time ( about eight hours ) before being washed .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared to a plac@@ ebo ( same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies , in which the patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or the plac@@ ebo was carried out either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tum@@ ours after 12 weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies on 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ oses .
in all trials Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the plac@@ ebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the total healing rate in all four primary studies was 15 % to 52 % in the patients treated with plac@@ ebo . • Results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete healing rate of 66 % to 80 % in the patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , not hyper@@ ker@@ ato@@ tic , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic acute Ker@@ at@@ oses ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or scal@@ p of immun@@ o@@ competent adults , if the size or number of l@@ esi@@ ons limit the efficacy and / or acceptance of cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other top@@ ical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .
apply Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) before bed@@ time and leave 6 to 10 hours on the skin .
treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine cream is to continue until all visible tendencies in the genital or peri@@ anal region have disappeared or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an interruption in the treatment process described above should be considered when intense local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or when an infection is observed in the treatment area .
after the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated l@@ esi@@ ons are only completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
when a dose is om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then proceed with the usual therapy plan .
apply i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine cream in a thin layer and apply it in the puri@@ fied , infected skin areas until the cream is fully dra@@ ined .
it should take place in these patients between the benefits of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
it should take place in these patients between the benefits of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft versus host reaction .
in other studies , in which no daily precau@@ tion was performed , two cases of serious phi@@ mo@@ sis and a case with circumcision leading to circumcision were observed .
an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations were observed even under appropriate application , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or caused a temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the outlet of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ itated emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
no clinical experience has been available for the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine cream immediately after treatment with other cut@@ aneous inj@@ ections for the treatment of extreme genital war@@ ts in the genital and peri@@ anal area .
limited data indicates an increased rate of suscep@@ ti@@ bility reduction in HIV @-@ positive patients , but I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream showed a lower efficacy in this group of patients with respect to the elimination of the fung@@ al war@@ ts .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips , or the hair@@ line was not examined .
local skin reactions are common , but the intensity of these reactions usually decreases during therapy or reactions atro@@ phy after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to patient complaints or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made of several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin around 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
as currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment is available , other appropriate forms of therapy should be considered in case of super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
in patients with rel@@ ap@@ sed and pre@@ treated BC@@ Cs no clinical experiences are present , therefore the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ours .
data from an open clinical study indicates that tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) are less likely to respond to i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not studied for the treatment of ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip@@ stick .
there are only very limited data on the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and the scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands do not support the efficacy in this application , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions usually decrease in intensity in the course of therapy or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if the local skin reactions cause great discomfort to the patient or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for a few days .
data from an open clinical study showed that patients with more than 8 acc@@ esi@@ ons showed a lower total healing rate than patients with less than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons .
due to immune @-@ stimulating properties , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine cream should be used with care in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies show no direct or indirect effects on the pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) were achieved neither after one @-@ off or after a multiple top@@ ical application , no recommendation can be given to the application during breast@@ feeding .
the most commonly reported and likely or possibly associated with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related adverse events in trials with three weeks of treatment were local reactions in the location of treatment of the case war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the most common reported and probably or possibly associated with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ eo @-@ cream related side @-@ effects include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the bas@@ ali@@ oma patients treated by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical study of phase III reported side effects are shown below .
the most common , probably or possibly with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine @-@ cream related side effects were in these studies a reaction to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ide ) .
adverse events indicated by 25@@ 2 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream are listed below .
this assessment of the clinical signs provided according to the test plan shows that in these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies , with three times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream , it often came to local skin reactions including er@@ y@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ c@@ ori@@ ation / leaves ( 23 % ) and e@@ dem@@ a ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) .
according to the study schedule , this evaluation of clinical signs shows that in these studies , with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream , it is very common to severe er@@ y@@ thema ( 31 % ) , heavy ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe sho@@ or@@ age and cal@@ ci@@ fication ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials investigating the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was observed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the in@@ adver@@ tent oral intake of 200 mg of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine , which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , head@@ aches , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically most severe side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , was in hyp@@ ot@@ onia which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluids .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation , systemic concentrations of alpha @-@ interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies , efficacy was significantly superior in an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine treatment over 16 weeks of plac@@ ebo treatment .
in 60 % of the total of 119 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , the patients were completely healed ; this was the case at 20 % of the 105 patients treated with plac@@ ebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved in 23 % of 157 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , compared to 5 % of 161 with plac@@ ebo @-@ treated male patients ( 95 % CI :
the efficacy of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine in five times application per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed individual primary super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) of all treated patients were clin@@ ically healed and that remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine at three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic acc@@ esi@@ ons within a con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the hair@@ y scal@@ p or face .
the one @-@ year data from two combined observation studies indicate a recur@@ r@@ ence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods .
the approved indications are external fung@@ al war@@ ts , ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma usually do not appear in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream was examined in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine could not be shown in these studies in the dos@@ ages examined there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively )
a minimal systemic image of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose was observed in the three @-@ week weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentrations in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and were 0.1 , 0,2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the application in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 disposable p@@ ou@@ ch ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ life after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in a previous study ; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
systemic exposure data showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine after top@@ ical application of patients between 6 @-@ 12 years was low and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study of der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rats , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg lead to significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study of der@@ mal application conducted for four months showed no similar effects with the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice during the three days a week did not in@@ duce tum@@ ours in the application area .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ ated , there is a risk for man due to systemic exposure to be considered very low .
the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the carbon @-@ free cream earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .
it can harm other people even if they have the same symptoms as you . − If any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .

if this daily cleaning under the fores@@ kin is not performed , swelling , th@@ inning of the skin or difficulty can be expected when the fores@@ kin is rolled back .
do not apply Al@@ dar@@ a Creme in the ureth@@ ra , in the vagina ( vagina ) , the cervi@@ x ( cervi@@ x ) or within the anus ( anus ) .
if other medicines have serious problems with your immune system , you should use this medication for not more than one treatment cycle .
if you have intercourse with genital war@@ ts in the genital area , treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream after sexual intercourse ( not before ) is to be carried out .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use other medicines or have recently been used even if it is not prescription medicine .
do not breast@@ feed your baby during treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a Cream , as it is not known whether I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od occurs in breast milk .
the frequency and duration of the treatment are different in case of case war@@ ts , bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma and ac@@ tin Ker@@ at@@ ose ( see specific instructions for each application area ) .
apply a thin layer of Al@@ dar@@ a cream to the clean , dry skin with the cow@@ ard and rub the cream gently on the skin until the cream is fully dra@@ ined .
&quot; &quot; &quot; men with cow@@ ards under the fores@@ kin must withdraw the fores@@ kin every day and wash the skin underneath ( see section 2 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you need to consider before applying Al@@ dar@@ a Cream ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
please talk to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have the impression that the effect of Al@@ dar@@ a is too strong or too weak .

if your skin re@@ acts too strongly to the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream , you should not use the cream any further , wash the affected area of the skin with water and a mild soap and contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
a lower number of blood cells can make you more suscep@@ tible to infections ; it can cause you to produce a blue stain sooner or it can cause fatigue .
tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this information .
in addition , you can feel it@@ ching ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas on which you have applied Al@@ dar@@ a cream ( 8 % of patients ) .
usually these are lighter skin reactions that res@@ ound in about 2 weeks after the treatment has been removed .
occasionally , some patients notice changes in the application location ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , swelling , scar@@ ring , skin irrit@@ ation , bli@@ sters , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irrit@@ ability , nausea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and fatigue .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( symptoms that are not associated with brain or nerves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and thus accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints that make movements difficult , reduced lung volume , heart and eye diseases .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic disorders .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ alizing devices , and patients may need appropriate medicines to prevent an allergic reaction before the administration .

the study mainly investig@@ ates the safety of the drug , but its effectiveness was also measured ( by examining the effect in relation to the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat sensation , fever and reactions at the in@@ fusion point .
frequent side effects in patients under five years of age are elevated blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measuring size of the lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may react strongly hyper@@ sensitive to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
every year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be known , and where necessary update this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients receiving al@@ ur@@ az@@ y@@ ms with regard to the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. a permit for the launching of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O m@@ am@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , egg stock of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with a secure diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic disorders .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 e / kg / h can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes in single steps .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only take place in an appropriate clinical setting where re@@ vit@@ alizing facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
as a result of the clinical phase 3 study , nearly all patients with Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase are expected to form , usually within 3 months from the start of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
since there is little experience in resum@@ ing the treatment after a longer break , the risk of hyper@@ sensitivity after an interruption of the treatment has to be cau@@ ti@@ ously avoided .
60 minutes before the beginning of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ agents ) to treat the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of mild or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the treatment should be considered with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or reduce the in@@ fusion rate to half the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) and a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous response occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ aine because there is a potential risk of interfer@@ ing with in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular intake of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not cause direct or indirect effects on the pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since there are no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase via the mother &apos;s milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed during the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
the adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( duration of treatment up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the Phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or over , are listed in the following table according to the following frequency : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; commonly ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions emerged , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respir@@ ation and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted drug effects associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study involving a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with predominantly severe delay form and a duration of treatment up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
most patients received a Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version within 3 months of the beginning of the treatment , most of the patients with a more severe form of follow @-@ up within a month ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) .
up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or until a premature departure from the study ) no investig@@ ational antibodies ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say were present in 13 / 45 patients , including 3 patients with whom it had never been too late .
patients with low or low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , whereas a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the urine was determined in patients with high antibody ti@@ tr@@ es .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to small neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ing effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro , which did not imp@@ air the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in the urine .
the presence of antibodies did not seem to be associated with the incidence of unwanted drug reactions although the incidence of undes@@ irable drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for enzyme therapy is one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accum@@ ul@@ ating medium and the prevention of further accumulation of adequate enzyme activity .
after IV in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the blood circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely using man@@ nose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms were examined in a random@@ ized , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study involving 45 patients aged 6 to 43 .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire spectrum of the disease , the majority of patients had an average phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the heavy phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( Fe@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected Fe@@ V and the total distance in the 6 @-@ minute ear test .
all patients were then recru@@ ited for an open label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me each week for 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and sal@@ aries presented in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as shown in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of Fe@@ V is not clin@@ ically significant over this period and the total pul@@ mon@@ ary volume increased further proportion@@ ately to the size of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) reached normal liver size up to the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks a significant drop in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) was established , which remained constant to the end of the study .
in terms of the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients , which was taken into account by using a combined end point , clin@@ ically significant changes across five efficacy variables ( expected percentage of normal shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , there was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion in the study ( 16 patients with severe course form and 4 with mean follow @-@ up form ) .
in four patients the dosage due to increased G@@ ag@@ - mirror in the urine in week 22 was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were determined according to the Z @-@ Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe course form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed normal mental development speed whereas in the older patients with severe delay @-@ form only limited or no progress was observed in cognitive development .
in a phase 4 study , investigations on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms dosing regi@@ mens were performed on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a justi@@ fiable alternative for patients with difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing regi@@ mens is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate every new information available annually , and if necessary , the description of the medicinal properties will be updated .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients under 5 years of age was similar to that of elderly and less severely affected patients .
based on the conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in one @-@ off administration , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not reveal any particular dangers to humans .

in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase containing certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ amin@@ og@@ ly@@ kan@@ e ) is completely absent , either in small amounts or this enzyme is missing completely .
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to one of the components of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have occurred a severe allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect occurring during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
if you are using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines please inform your doctor if you are taking pharmaceuticals that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine , because there is a possible risk of a reduced effect of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken medicines , including non @-@ prescription drugs .
tips for handling - di@@ lution and use The concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to use and is provided for intraven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors and medical professionals ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 e / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - implic@@ it involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre @-@ history , however , severe reactions emerged , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing mal@@ function and facial oils .
very common ( occurrence for more than 1 of 10 patients ) : • Head@@ ache • nausea • abdominal pain • Skin rash • joint pain , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • Incre@@ ased heart rate • hyper@@ tension • less oxygen in the blood • reaction at the in@@ fusion point

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( medicine against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body or spreads easily to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer that does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cell cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not been treated before , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who previously received other chem@@ o@@ therapies than any therapy .
in order to reduce side effects , patients should intake a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an additional &quot; anti@@ eme@@ tics &quot; ( remedy against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent liquid deficiency ) should be given before or after the application of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients whose blood flow changes or in which certain other side effects occur , treatment should be delayed , dis@@ continued or the dose is reduced .
the active form of tel@@ emet@@ re@@ ins therefore slow@@ s down the formation of the DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from dividing .
the transformation of tel@@ emet@@ ric to its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer term of action in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural therapy , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared to the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another anti @-@ cancer drug ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1,@@ 7@@ 25 patients who previously had no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months for the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.3 months , compared with 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
however , in both studies , patients with whom the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cell cells showed longer survival times when administration of A@@ lim@@ ta than with the comparative investig@@ ational medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. a permit for the launch of A@@ lim@@ ta in the European Union .
each bottle must be dissolved with 4.@@ 2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a resolution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary do@@ - sis is taken from the pi@@ erc@@ ing bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer , except for over@@ lying plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer , except for over@@ lying plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered intraven@@ ously intraven@@ ously over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after the completion of the Sher@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small @-@ cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is given as an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in order to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given on the day before and on the day of the tel@@ emet@@ ric administration as well as on the day after the treatment .
during the seven days prior to the first dose of Sher@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued during the whole therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last Sher@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients also have to receive an in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first p@@ emet@@ ric dose as well as after every third operation cycle .
in patients who receive Sher@@ emet@@ re@@ xed , a complete hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge should be created before each administration , including a differentiation of the leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and a plat@@ el@@ et count .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose test must take place in consideration of the N@@ adi@@ r of the blood balance or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous therapy cycles .
after the recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are applied to A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Grade 2 bleeding .
should patients develop non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ Grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient has the value before treatment
the treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be stopped if a ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity grade 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - at the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical trials showed no evidence that patients aged 65 years of age or over 65 years of age have an increased risk of side effects .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials , no dose adjustment was necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearance ≥ 45 ml / min , which sur@@ pass the dose adjustment recommended for all patients .
the data layer in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 fold of the upper limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values from &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 times of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies .
patients must be supervised with regard to bone mar@@ ital immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression and tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed may not be administered to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils count again a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the plat@@ el@@ et cy@@ te has a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , plat@@ el@@ et number and maximum non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity observed in previous cycles ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of Grade 3 / 4 ha@@ emat@@ ological and non @-@ human ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia were observed when pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 occurred .
therefore , all patients treated with tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed have to be instructed to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure to reduce the toxic@@ ity of treated toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous use of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tics ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days after therapy with tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients who undergo therapy with tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed have to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ life for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients where these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes .
therefore , a drainage of the eff@@ lu@@ ent before the plasma @-@ mixed treatment should be considered in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid buil@@ du@@ p in the trans@@ der@@ cellular space .
5 severe cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical trials with tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed occasionally when administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated live vaccine ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of an ir@@ reversible injury of the reproductive capacity is mixed by tel@@ emet@@ ry , men should be advised in front of the treatment centre in order to obtain advice regarding the preservation of the sperm .
in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tics ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dos@@ ages ( ≥ 1.3 g. a day ) lead to a reduction in tel@@ emet@@ ric discharge with the result of increased occurrence of side effects .
therefore , caution is required when treating high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or ac@@ e- t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses to be avoided for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.4 ) .
since no data concerning the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b is available , the simultaneous application with tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed has to be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , at least 2 days after therapy with tel@@ emet@@ re@@ - xed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ timet@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected in the case of an application during pregnancy .
tel@@ emet@@ re@@ xed may not be used during pregnancy except if strictly required and after careful weighing of benefits for the mother and the risk of fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of irre@@ versi@@ bly deterioration of the reproductive capacity by tel@@ emet@@ ry , men should be advised before the start of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the blocking of the sperm .
it is not known whether tel@@ emet@@ ric mixed in breast milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed inf@@ ant cannot be ruled out .

A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( Sher@@ emet@@ re@@ xed ) is a ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti @-@ fol@@ ate , which ex@@ erts its effect by interrup@@ ting important metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that tel@@ emet@@ ry operates as an anti@@ fol@@ ate with several attack points by blocking the thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ lat@@ yn@@ th@@ ase ( TS ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ ate reduc@@ t@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , the fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzymes of the de nov@@ o Bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ in and Pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .
E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multic@@ entre , random@@ ised , simple @-@ blind , Phase 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , showed that patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically meaningful benefit to survival compared to those patients who were only cur@@ led with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the primary analysis of this study was conducted in the population of all patients who received the test medication in the arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ ea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural retinal oth@@ eli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared with the sole C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms were affected by an improvement of the pul@@ mon@@ ary function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a decrease in lung function over time in the control arm .
a multic@@ entre , random@@ ised , open phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy achieved medi@@ an survival of patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and 7.@@ 9 months with patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the treatment effect on overall survival was found in favor of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 0.@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 1.@@ 00 , p = 0,@@ 0@@ 47 ) , adjusted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1,@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data from a separately random@@ ised , controlled phase 3 study showed that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for tel@@ emet@@ ry between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre@@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el are similar .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analysis of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
medi@@ an PFS was 4,@@ 8 months for the combination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.1 months for the combination gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( 95 % CI = 27.@@ 3 - 3@@ 3,@@ 9 ) for the combination gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 3@@ 1.4 ) for gem@@ cit@@ abine combination .
the analysis of the influence of NSC@@ LC hist@@ ology to survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences in accordance with hist@@ ology , see table below .
CI = intent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = intent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = magnitude of the population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = hazard ratio ) clearly below the non @-@ le@@ verage ratio of 1.@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin required less trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te ker@@ fu@@ sions ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) .

it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with a low @-@ calorie , fat @-@ reduced diet .
patients who take allergy and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they can not break down some fats in the food , causing a quarter of the fats that are fed with the food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed into the intest@@ ines .
in a third study All@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with plac@@ ebo .
in the two studies on patients with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took All@@ i 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after one year , compared with 2.3 kg when taking plac@@ ebo .
in the study with all@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no relevant weight loss could be observed for patients .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots on after , fl@@ atus ( winds ) with stage duct , stu@@ cco thread , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , finish o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( decay ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( winds ) and soft chairs .
it should not be used in patients who are treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may also not be used in patients suffering from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( with which not enough nutrients from the digestive tract ) or on cholesterol ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant women or in breast@@ feeding mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited appro@@ ving the placing of Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for reducing the weight of adults with overweight ( BM@@ I body mass index ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in combination with a slightly hypo@@ cal@@ oric , low @-@ fat diet .
all@@ i may not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , since there is not enough data on efficacy and safety .
since or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally absorbed , it is not necessary to adjust the dosage for older people and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Chr@@ onic mal@@ absorption syndrome • Cholest@@ asis • pregnancy ( see section 4.6 ) • Premature treatment with War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single @-@ meal or a rich diet .
as weight reduction in diabetes is associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i , because the dose of anti@@ diabe@@ tics should be adapted if necessary .
patients taking all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these medicines has to be adapted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnancy @-@ prevention measures in order to prevent possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
in a study on interactions of drugs as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a reduction of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( International Reg@@ ular ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years remained the levels of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as the beta car@@ ot@@ ine in the normal range .
however , patients should be advised to take a supplementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the application of a single dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a marginal decrease of the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time .
animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic and fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented .
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) .
the frequency of adverse events reported after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown , as these events were volunte@@ ered by a population of some magnitude .
† It is plau@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight subjects without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases reported after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosing , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on research on humans and animals , a quick recovery of any systemic effects caused by the inhibit@@ ory properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed .
in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine the therapeutic effect is due to co@@ valent bonding to the active serum @-@ rest of the ga@@ stri@@ c and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic lifts .
clinical trials have shown that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocks the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 show the efficacy of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ cal@@ oric , fat @-@ reduced diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ ization ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in the body weight in the course of study ( table 1 ) and as a percentage of those participating in study , who lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( table 2 ) .
although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average dietary change in the Gesamt@@ cholest@@ erin amounted to 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average dietary change in LD@@ L cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline : 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( initial value of 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the mean change in waist circum@@ ference was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3.7 cm ) and plac@@ ebo -@@ 3,@@ 6 cm ( bas@@ eline : 10@@ 3,5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could only be detected spor@@ adic@@ ally and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation .
two main met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , i.e. M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed lac@@ t@@ ear@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 , after spl@@ itting the N @-@ shape leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , were identified in a study with obes@@ e patients , which showed nearly 42 % of the total plasma concentration .
based on the conventional studies of safety mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not show any particular danger to humans .
pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance system The holder of approval for placing on the market must ensure that the pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance system , in accordance with the version of July 2007 as described in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the application for authorisation , is applied and works before and during the product is available on the market .

the most common side effects are related to the mode of action of the capsules and result in more fat being ex@@ cre@@ ted from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first weeks of the treatment , as you may not have consistently reduced the fat percentage in your diet .
with the following basic rules , you can learn to minimize the diet @-@ related side effects : • Beg@@ in already a few days , or better a week , before the first intake of the capsules with a fat @-@ du@@ sty diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of the portions that you normally consume .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ el@@ ihood of exceeding your fat limit decreases . • Distri@@ bute your recommended amount of fat evenly on your daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat you may consume each meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main dish or a substantial dessert , as you may have done in other programs for weight reduction . • Most people in whom these accompanying symptoms occur learn to control them with time by adjusting their diet .

Alo@@ is is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the efficacy of Alo@@ is can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug that can be used as an anti@@ eme@@ tics ) .
the application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as there is not enough information on the effects in this age group .
this means that the active ingredient inhi@@ bits the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
in three main studies , Alo@@ is was examined in 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are severe or moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ is showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , versus 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 out of 2@@ 21 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ is showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , versus 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 from 185 ) .
in comparison with dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ is ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 out of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted the company Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . approval for the launch of Alo@@ is in the European Union .
Alo@@ is is indicated : to prevent acute nausea and vom@@ iting in highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the efficacy of Alo@@ is to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting induced by a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on as@@ say , patients with an@@ am@@ ne@@ sty ob@@ sti@@ pation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is required with simultaneous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ t interval is extended or who tend to such an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ is is said to be used neither for pro@@ phyla@@ xis or for the treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting in the days after chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five investigated chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ in , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in , and mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
a clinical study showed no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a steady @-@ st@@ ate@@ - concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pl@@ ami@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , the simultaneous addition of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( D@@ exam@@ eth@@ as@@ one and Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) as well as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( am@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , hal@@ operi@@ dol , k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) had no significant effect on the clearance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience regarding the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies is not present , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women , unless it is considered necessary by the attending physician .
in clinical trials , the most frequent side effects observed with a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least associated with Alo@@ is , were head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ pation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the location ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post marketing reports .
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar occur@@ ren@@ ces of adverse events as in the other dosing groups ; there were no dose @-@ effect relationships to be observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out , however , due to the large distribution volume , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy for an over@@ dose of Alo@@ is .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 25@@ mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 25@@ mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide ( half @-@ value of 7.@@ 3 hours ) were given that were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ized double blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients receiving a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ z@@ ine as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared with patients who received 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 .
results of the studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are combined in the following tables .
in clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval were comparable with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the findings of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and pro@@ long the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was to evaluate the EC@@ G effects of intraven@@ ous pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption After IV administration follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average half @-@ value of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C @-@ ∞ ) are generally dose @-@ proportional in the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3 @-@ 90 μ / kg for healthy and cancer patients .
after IV administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase of the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations indicate that once daily IV administration of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to that measured after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg measured value ; however , the C@@ max was higher after the intake of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and around 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , which , compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in vitro studies on the metabolism have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser extent , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an IV single dose of 10 m@@ c@@ g / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , approximately 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an imm@@ utable ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a unique intraven@@ ous bolt injection in healthy patients , the overall body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
in patients with severe liver dysfunction , termin@@ ale eli@@ ft survival and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , however , a reduction of the dose is not justified .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were only observed after ex@@ positions which are considered sufficient beyond the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use .
10 out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , evidence suggests that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular deformation and rep@@ ol@@ arization and can pro@@ long the duration of action .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to the 30@@ x of the therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given every day over two years , resulted in increased frequency of liver tum@@ ours , en@@ doc@@ rine ne@@ oplas@@ ma ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al mar@@ row ) and skin tum@@ ours in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ is is intended for one @-@ time use in humans , the relevance of these results is regarded as low for the human being .
the holder of this approval must inform the European Commission on the plans for placing the drug approved under this decision .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) approved a negative report in which the approval of the marketing of the drug aimed at the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended Al@@ ph@@ le@@ 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medi@@ cally effective ingredient that has already been approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
in the case of a micro@@ scopic investigation , the liver tissue damages damage , moreover , the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood ab@@ normally be increased .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced to stimulate the formation of the active substance .
Al@@ ph@@ eon has presented data that demonstrate the comparison between Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active ingredient structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of operation , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study on patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of al@@ ph@@ al was compared to the efficacy of the reference resin with 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients responded to the drug after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was stopped ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA is acknowledged .
in addition , concerns have been reported that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed should not be sufficient .
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical study .
after setting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease again fl@@ amed up in more patients than with the refer@@ ral drug ; al@@ ph@@ e@@ ons also had more side effects .
apart from this , the test used in the trial investigating the extent to which the drug respon@@ ds to an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) is not adequately vali@@ dated .
it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected Laz@@ er@@ ations ( crack or cuts ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ t @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because it may not affect this type of infection .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients with age of nine months , but patients under 18 years of age may not be more than 2 % of the body &apos;s surface .
if the patient does not respond to treatment after two to three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection had expi@@ red after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients with plac@@ ebo responded to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin findings , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : if the results of both studies were viewed at skin wound , approximately 90 % of the patients in both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ei@@ ter@@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections that were demonstr@@ ably or probably caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the place of the order .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go were out@@ weigh@@ ed in the short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ fir@@ mi@@ ties , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . approval for the launch of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in case of sensi@@ ti@@ zing or severe local irrit@@ ation by using Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment is canc@@ eled , the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully wi@@ ped out and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection is started .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections where MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gen or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected place occurs after a 2 to 3 day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical remedies on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations achieved in humans after top@@ ical application on a sc@@ rolled skin or infected super@@ ficial wounds , clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vivo is not expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 Accor@@ ding to oral administration of 2 times a day 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol increased the medi@@ an Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max according to top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on sc@@ rolled skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure to top@@ ical application in patients , dose adjustments are not considered necessary if top@@ ical res@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the birth and fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of a systemic antibiotic .
when deciding whether the breast@@ feeding continues / ends or the therapy with al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / stopped , balancing the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the baby and the benefit of the al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman should be weigh@@ ed down .
in clinical trials to 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections that have used Al@@ tar@@ go , the most commonly reported side effect was irrit@@ ation on the administration of the administration , which concerned about 1 % of the patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ ge@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the function mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the selective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a certain binding site of the 50s sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ally inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the binding point ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase@@ center .
by binding at this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , block partial P @-@ binding interaction and prevent normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
if due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at at least some infection forms appear question@@ able , a consultation should be sought by experts .
no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin against S.@@ au@@ re@@ us were detected , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of non @-@ response to the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tr@@ unks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and on pe@@ eled skin for up to 7 days .
out of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days of the top@@ ical treatment of secondary traum@@ atic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
samples were taken on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic intake on humans for top@@ ical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 of pe@@ eled skin ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng · h / ml ) was 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ ols was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with lower participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were conducted over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes .
in vitro screening on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes as well as in the rat @-@ micro @-@ core test for in @-@ vivo study of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
neither male nor female rats showed signs of reduced fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , resulting in an exposure to 5 times higher than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( top@@ ical application on 200 c@@ m2 of skin ) :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study on rats were determined at oral dos@@ ages ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development toxic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a two @-@ dose @-@ existing vacc@@ ination plan , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix should only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during im@@ muni@@ zation and is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan can be brought to an end from two doses .
if a refres@@ her dose is desired for hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given .
vacc@@ ines act by contributing to the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) , as it can fight against a disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alien &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the V@@ ine Inf@@ rix vaccine that has been approved since 1996 and has been approved since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix are adults identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the share of vacc@@ inated children who had developed protective antibody concentrations a month after the last injection .
in an additional study involving 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 month interval between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix conducted between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations for hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that Ambi@@ rix &apos;s degree of protection was similar to a six @-@ month and a 12 month interval between inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , fatigue ) and irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix should not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als a permit for the launching of Ambi@@ rix in the whole
the standardi@@ zation plan for pri@@ mers with ambi@@ tions consists of two doses , the first dose is given at the date of the election and the second dose is given between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a booster set is desired for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or combination vaccine .
the anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and Anti @-@ Hepatitis A Virus ( anti @-@ H@@ V ) antibodies are the same as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured whether immun@@ o@@ competent persons who have responded to a Hepatitis A@@ - vacc@@ ination require a booster effect as protection , as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in case of no more det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all inj@@ ections , an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the application of the vaccine should always be available immediately after the application of the vaccine .
if a faster protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine , which contains 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the case of hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s @-@ antibody @-@ value is achieved under certain circumstances , so that in these cases , the administration of other vacc@@ ines can be required .
because an in@@ tra @-@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular administration of the glut@@ eal muscle could lead to a sub@@ optimal outcome , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
in th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disturbances , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected exceptionally sub@@ cut@@ an@@ e@@ ously as it may occur in these cases after in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular administration to bleeding .
if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ el , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects it must be assumed that there is possibly no adequate immune response .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the incidence of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ch@@ iness , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier thi@@ omer and preserv@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vaccine doses were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years , Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ dose @-@ combination vaccine .
the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and fatigue on a basis of comp@@ ut@@ ational treatment per vacc@@ ination dose , but not on the basis of a calculation base per person .
pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix in 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.2 % of the subjects after the administration of a dose of the 3 @-@ dose @-@ combination vaccine .
after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the subjects that had received Ambi@@ rix reported pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % of the subjects vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of match was comparable high per pro@@ band ( i.e. about the entire vaccine cycle in 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects receiving Ambi@@ rix compared to 3@@ 6.2 % of the subjects receiving the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) .
the incidence of severe pain and pain was low and comparable to those observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ doses vaccine .
in a comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year vacc@@ inations , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ gruppe was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3 @-@ dose @-@ combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix was reported a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band .
the percentage of vacc@@ ines reported about severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted on vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years , the anti @-@ HA@@ V serum conversion rates were 9@@ 9.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , month 6 administered dose ( that is , in month 7 ) .
the ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , at month 6 administered dose ( that is , in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combination vaccine with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was evalu@@ able , the serum rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in month 2 and 6 were significantly higher compared with Ambi@@ rix in the month 2 and 6 after administration of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine .
the immune responses , which were reached in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. , in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ dose @-@ vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vaccine with a combination vaccine with a combination vaccine containing 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in people who were between 12 and 15 years old at the time of the pri@@ mers , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immune response observed in this study was comparable to that after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine , consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds it could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable 24 months after im@@ muni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme to the in the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was given at the same time with the booster formulation of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ a- , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates as for earlier formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ en@@ sion on any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .
according to article 114 of Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , state charge sharing is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorized for this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through virus @-@ containing foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as swimming in poll@@ uted waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may require a steady treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not fully protect against infection with hepatitis B virus or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vaccine series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child are already infected with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus before administration of both doses of vacc@@ ines ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the vacc@@ ination time ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms that are similar to those after hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection can not be medi@@ ated .
• If you / your child have already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can be caused by it@@ ching ras@@ hes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to a previous vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B , if you / your child have a serious infection with fever .
• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the usual administration of the second vacc@@ ination dosage ) .
at a potential risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child of vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , he / your child will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ination dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose for this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection before the vacc@@ ination series ends .
sometimes , Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected with people suffering from severe bleeding disorders , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child is weak due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s def@@ ences , or if you / your child will undergo a ha@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient , allowing a blood test to be required to see how strong the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take other medicines ( including those that you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child have been vacc@@ inated recently / has received / has received / has received / has / or planned it in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine needs to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix should be vacc@@ inated at separate spots and as many extre@@ mi@@ ties as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix should be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine is nevertheless sufficient .
usually , Ambi@@ rix will not admini@@ ster pregnant or breast@@ feeding women , unless it is urgently required to vacc@@ inate both hepatitis A and hepatitis B .
please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) for you / your child .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ Very common ( more than 1 case per 10 im@@ pregn@@ ated cans ) : • P@@ ain or discomfort at the punc@@ ture or redness • Mat@@ ness • irrit@@ ability • headache • lack of appetite
♦ Frequ@@ ent ( up to 1 case per 10 im@@ pregn@@ ated cans ) : • swelling at the injection site • fever ( over 38 ° C ) • Over@@ di@@ ade@@ dness • Ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal disorders
other side effects reported on days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 in@@ im@@ pregn@@ ated cans ) are :
these include locally restricted or expanded ras@@ hes , which can be it@@ chy or can be bli@@ stering , swelling of the eye contours and the face , difficult breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden blood pressure drop and un@@ consciousness .

23 Find your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you / your child or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this package .
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data that has become known since the launch of the first authorization for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP has shown that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix is positive .
since Ambi@@ rix was only launched in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to low patient exposure .
amp@@ rap@@ es@@ eed can also be used in patients aged over a month with full enzyme defect or hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
ammon@@ ia is - divided into several single doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or administered via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch ( through the stomach @-@ blanket into the stomach of leading tu@@ bing ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading tu@@ bing ) .
it was not a comparative study , since Am@@ mon@@ caps could not be compared with any other treatment or plac@@ ebo ( pseu@@ do drug , i.e. without active ingredient ) .
amp@@ rap@@ es@@ can also cause loss of appetite , abnormal acidity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste disturbances or taste failure , abdominal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ pation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented high ammon@@ ia levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; amp@@ rap@@ es@@ eed was licensed under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information on this medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients , in which a complete enzyme shortage has already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of the life ) .
in patients with a late @-@ manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests after the first life month ) , there is an indication for the use of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for babies , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ulated form .
the daily dose is calculated individually taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for growth and development .
according to the previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg and in adolescents and adults .
in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ b@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ inate syndrome require ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing , as there is a risk for the formation of es@@ oph@@ ag@@ ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
therefore , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or serious ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as in associated clinical conditions associated with sodium retention and o@@ dem@@ a .
since the metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at takes place over the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results in pregnant women is not known ; therefore , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate on young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) resulted in slow@@ ing down the ne@@ ural increase and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and therefore a disability of the brain growth .
it could not be as@@ cer@@ tained whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in the mother &apos;s milk in humans , and for this reason , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients reported at least an adverse event ( AE ) and at 78 % of these adverse events was assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic response to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported from an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ tate can , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ tery top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of an over@@ dose occurred in a 5 @-@ month @-@ old inf@@ ant with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms are accompanied by the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in intraven@@ ous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is an active compound that is con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys .
Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine can be compared with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 Pati@@ ents with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be believed to be produced for each gram of a sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl dosage of 0.@@ 12 to 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started in order to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of early symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always unaffected , and the disease itself led to death in the treatment of per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analog@@ a within the first year of life .
by hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis , utilization of alternative methods of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced corrosion and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns at post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first life month ) to 80 % .
patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and had already been treated prior to the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy was 100 % survival , but even in these patients it was time for many mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late @-@ manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the Or@@ ni@@ b@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , who recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated permanently with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a protein @-@ reduced diet , survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition may occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ in is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidney with glut@@ amine , where phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is produced .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined by adding a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in metabolism , and repeated doses of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients with intraven@@ ous sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were detected 15 minutes after ing@@ es@@ tion .
in the majority of patients with ure@@ a @-@ dys@@ functions or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was not det@@ ectable in the next morning after night fasting .
in three out of six patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma label were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts .
the medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted from the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ in with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses had no conc@@ eal effects ( investigation 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who can &apos;t swal@@ low any tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing ) or a gastro@@ intestinal paras@@ ite or a nas@@ al probe .
according to the previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg and in adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ b@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS pellets containing 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat @-@ fl@@ utes were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabolism of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) before the birth , l@@ esi@@ ons in the pyr@@ amid@@ al cells of the cor@@ tex occurred .
a prob@@ able toxic response to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported from an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ tate can , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ tery top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine can be compared with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of surplus
investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be believed to produce a sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl dosage of 0.@@ 12 to 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in treatment , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition may occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in gran@@ ulated form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were detected 15 minutes after intake .
during durability the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C .
in this procedure , the small measuring sco@@ op contains 0.@@ 95 g , the mean measuring sco@@ op 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
if a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the solu@@ bility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nit@@ ro@@ genous waste products which accum@@ ulate in the body after eating proteins .
if laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at may affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
during breast@@ feeding , you should not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the medicine may go over to breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , headache , taste disturbances , decay of the hearing , dis@@ ori@@ tism , memory disorders and a deterioration of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed .
if you notice any of these symptoms , contact your doctor or hospital &apos;s emergency department for the purpose of introducing appropriate treatment .

angi@@ ox is used for the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example with unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the thor@@ ax with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) ( abnormal measurement value in electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if an@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this may help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14@@ ,000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox at all@@ ot@@ al administration or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another medicine to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) was compared with conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I .
during the PCI the patient was often a st@@ ent ( a short tube left in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) and additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as ab@@ u@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS , angi@@ ox - with or without the administration of GP@@ I - was as effective as conventional treatment in the prevention of new events ( death cases , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year .
in patients undergoing a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was as effective as He@@ par@@ in in terms of all indicators , except for heavy bleeding where it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ ox should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , other Hi@@ ru@@ dine or any of the other ingredients .
it may also not be used in patients who recently had bleeding , as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart attack .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd approval for the Marketing Auth@@ or@@ isation of An@@ gi@@ ox in the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST le@@ verage attack ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency intervention or if early intervention is planned .
the recommended starting dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an IV dosage of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is subsequently performed with the patient , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to clinical requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dosage of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately before the procedure , a dosage of 0.5 mg / kg is to be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial IV indication of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight and one immediately subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
the safety and efficacy of an exclusive bol@@ us administration of An@@ gi@@ ox has not been investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place .
in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicinal product should be carefully mixed prior to the application and the dosage must be administered intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used in patients with moderate ren@@ al impair@@ ment ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) .
if the ACT value is less than 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose should be checked again .
in patients with moderate ren@@ al damage included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after giving the Bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without any dose adjustment on average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in patients with di@@ aly@@ sis , angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after termination of the intraven@@ ous administration of frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after termination of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other ingredients or against Hi@@ ru@@ dine • active ha@@ em@@ ost@@ asis and / or ir@@ reversible bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in patients with di@@ aly@@ sis
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
even though most of the arter@@ ial punc@@ ture points occur in PCI patients under Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) may present bleeding during treatment .
in patients who take War@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after dis@@ continuation of the treatment with the Bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ or reaches the level before the treatment .
based on the knowledge about the action mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ sis or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes aggregate ) , it can be assumed that these active substances increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of bi@@ vali@@ dates with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ators or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ ase@@ parameters can be checked regularly in any case .
animal experiments related to pregnancy , embry@@ onic and fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development are insufficient ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din alone , 46@@ 04 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din plus GP@@ II / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ized to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group and in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding was defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i scales for severe ble@@ ed@@ ings as in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both light and severe ble@@ ed@@ ings were significantly less frequent under Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din than in the groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus GP@@ II / II@@ I@@ a- or inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or bleeding in the punc@@ ture area , reduced hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in levels ≥ 5 cm at the point of punc@@ ture , reduction of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in levels ≥ 3 g / dl with well @-@ known bleeding area , re@@ operation due to bleeding , use of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
other , less frequently observed loc@@ al@@ is@@ ations that occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasional ) were &quot; other &quot; punc@@ ture sites , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat .
the following information on side effects is based on the data of a clinical trial with Bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ ine in 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group and in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both light and severe ble@@ ed@@ ings were significantly less common in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported in practice after a comprehensive application and are group@@ ed in table 6 according to system organ classes .
in case of an over@@ dose , the treatment with the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is to be stopped immediately and the patient is close mes@@ hed with regard to signs of bleeding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a direct and specific drug inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds to the cataly@@ tic centre as well as in the ion bin@@ der region of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in , regardless of whether th@@ rom@@ bo@@ ins are tied in the fluid stage or cl@@ ots .
binding of Bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ din to th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in , and hence its effect , is reversible , because th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in slowly spl@@ its the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thereby re@@ generating the function of the active centre of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in .
furthermore , by using a bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ or with serum from patients who had previously appeared to he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) , no plat@@ el@@ et ag@@ gregation reaction was induced .
in healthy subjects and in patients , Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect that is confirmed by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was subsequently performed , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST le@@ verage ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to receive a GP@@ II / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or before the start of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high risk patients who required angi@@ ography within 72 hours were uni@@ form@@ ly distributed over the 3 arms .
approximately 77 % of patients had a recurring isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and approximately 99 % of all patients underwent angi@@ ography within 72 hours .

the 30 @-@ day results , based on four @-@ fold and triple @-@ end@@ points of a random@@ ised double blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , are shown in Table 10 .
clinical trials with a small number of patients reported limited information on the application of angi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din were evaluated in patients undergoing a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with ACS .
it is expected that as a pep@@ tide , Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din as a pep@@ tide transforms a cat@@ aboli@@ sm into its amino acid components with subsequent re@@ utilisation of the amino acids in the body pool .
the primary metabolism resulting from the spl@@ itting of the AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ terminal sequence by Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is not effective because of the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic centre of thro@@ mb@@ in .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years onwards with diabetes that require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) inj@@ ected into the abdominal wall , thi@@ ghs or upper arm or administered as permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels ( sugar@@ s ) in the blood or cannot process insulin effectively .
insulin lu@@ c@@ ine is very slightly different from the human insulin , and the change means that it acts faster and has a shorter duration of action than a short @-@ acting insulin analog .
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in the application in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study involving 5@@ 72 children aged 4 @-@ 17 years .
in Type 2 diabetes , in which the body is unable to work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study involving adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was found in the first study compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin lip@@ id .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin secre@@ tion or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the launching of A@@ pi@@ dra throughout the European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is to be applied as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the delta muscle or to be applied sub@@ cut@@ an@@ e@@ ously through continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdominal wall .
due to the reduced glucose tolerance capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , the need for insulin can be reduced in patients with a reduction in liver function .
any change of the effective strength , the brand ( manufacturer ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc delay , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can result in a change in the insulin demand .
3 An insufficient dose or breakdown of treatment , especially in patients with an insulin @-@ charged diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and a diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these states are potentially life threatening .
the conversion of a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may necess@@ itate a change in the dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the effectiveness of the insulin used and can therefore change during the conversion of the treatment regi@@ men .
the substances that can increase blood sugar @-@ lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , di@@ op@@ yr@@ amide , fi@@ br@@ ates , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , s@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ regulation can be weakened or missing under the influence of sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic such as beta block@@ ers , c@@ lon@@ id@@ ine , gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and reserve .
animal experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ lu@@ c@@ sin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin flow occurs in human breast milk , but generally insulin is not absorbed either into mother &apos;s milk , nor is it absorbed by oral application .
listed below are listed adverse drug reactions reported from clinical trials ( very often : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .
cold sweat , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , lack of concentration , drow@@ sin@@ ess , excessive hun@@ - , changes in vision , head@@ aches , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations .
li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Is missed to continuously change the injection site within the injection area , can result in a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection site .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an in@@ tr@@ amus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , given by an appropriately trained person , or intraven@@ ous medication of glucose by a doctor .
after a glucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose intake ( in particular skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in the sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin absorption the effect occurs faster and the duration of action is shorter than with normal insulin .
in a study involving 18 male subjects at the age of 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes m@@ yo@@ car@@ c@@ ine , insulin lu@@ c@@ ine in the therapeutic dose ranges from 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0,@@ 15 E / kg showed a proportional , glucose @-@ lowering effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glucose @-@ lowering effect , just like human insulin .
insulin lu@@ c@@ ine has twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the total glu@@ cos@@ al effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
the data showed that 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post @-@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved with an application of insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin like with a normal normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if insulin was s@@ lic@@ ed 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale check was achieved than with a normal normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin absorption is turned 15 minutes after the start of the meal , comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , such as with a normal insulin analog , which is given 2 r@@ ents before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin lu@@ c@@ ine at a dose of 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal compared to the normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the start of the meal ( figure 1A ) as well as compared to the normal insulin that was given 2 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin lu@@ c@@ ine at a dose of 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - after@@ ward ) after the beginning of the meal compared to human Nor@@ - mal@@ insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) .
