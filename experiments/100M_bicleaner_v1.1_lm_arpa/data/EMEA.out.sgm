<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has evaluated the studies conducted to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your illness or treatment, please read the package leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">For further information on the basis of CHMP's recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg melt tablets (tablets, which dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirelessly think and speak, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not available), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I disturbance, a psychological disorder in which patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal high spirits) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes and for the prevention of manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used to quickly control increased unrest or behavioural disorders when oral ingestion of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be used to deposit or melt tablets in patients who difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are taking other medicines at the same time, the same as Abilify should be taken away, the dose should be adjusted by Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This interferes with the transmission of signals between brain cells by means of "neurotransmitters," i.e., chemical substances that allow neurons to communicate with each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "Aripiprazol is probably mainly known as" "" "partial agonist" "" "for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin)." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole, like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in less extent than the neurotransmitter works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazol contributes to normalizing the brain activity by reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing their recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify to prevent the recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies for up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar disorders, suffering from increased unrest, over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared over twelve weeks to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence in 160 patients with whom the manic symptoms had already been stabilised with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilizing injection was compared in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder, suffering from increased unrest, compared to Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">All studies examined the change in the symptoms of patients on the basis of a standard bipolar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the enamel tablets and the solution to intake (absorbs).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both trials with the injection solution, patients who received abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg showed significantly greater restlessness of symptoms than those receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify, in four of the five short-term studies, reduced manic symptoms more effectively than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo for the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15 mg doses were also more effective than placebo for the symptoms of increased unrest and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common Abilitify side effects (observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled cken), fatigue (drowsiness), headache, blurred vision, dyspepsia (loss of saliva), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disturbances) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar-I disturbance and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who were mostly manic episodes were outweighed against the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee concluded that the benefits of the injection solution in the fast control of increased unrest and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, if oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. approval for launching Abilify in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes were addressing the treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased effectiveness in dosages at a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">Considering the greater sensitivity of these patients, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the dosage should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases at the beginning or after a change of an antipsychotic therapy, also in case of treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that there was no increased risk of suicide in patients with bipolar disorder compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazol should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, overflow disturbances), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including active and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during the treatment with Aripilauzl.</seg>
<seg id="39">If symptoms and symptoms of late dyskinesia occur in a patient treated with Abilify, should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms indicative of a MNS or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be deposed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Aripiprazol should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in conditions associated with seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazol in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease had an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there was in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and response for adverse cervical events in patients treated with Aripilauzole.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia related adverse events in patients treated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyphenuria, polyphaggia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored regarding a deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenia and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Because of the primary efficacy of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is required when Aripiprazol is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective drugs with superimposed side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripilauzole, but this effect is not considered clinically relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazole by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">CYP2D6 'Bad' (= 'poor') Metabolizing can result in the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazol compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolism metabolicates.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the common administration of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, the potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, should have similar effects and similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After replacing the CYP2D6- or 3A4-inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be lifted to the dose level prior to the start of the adjuvant therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be administered with a moderate rise in Aripilauzol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg Aripiranzole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the mediums of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphic / 3-methoxymorphine-ratio), 2C19 (warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphian).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy while treating Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">This drug may not be used during pregnancy because of the insufficient data layer to ensure safety for humans and because of the concerns arising from the reproduction studies of the animal, unless the potential benefits justifies the potential risk for the foetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned of using dangerous machinery, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazol has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) compared to placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: common (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - in a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks in patients treated with Aripiprazole a total of lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS, including paraffin, Dystonia and dyskinesia, was compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study for 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients with Aripirozol treatment and 13.1% in patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">Another controlled long-term study for 26 weeks was the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole and 15.1% in patients suffering from omisapine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar-I disturbance - in a controlled study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 23.5% in patients with Aripilauzol- treatment and 53.3% in patients with haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients with Aripirozol treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for patients suffering from Aripilauzol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups in Aripilauzole and Placebo, with potentially clinically significant changes to routinely controlled laboratory parameters, showed no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases in CPK (creatine phosphoid kinase), transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripilauzole compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">The side effects that can occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, and also reported in the treatment with Aripilauzole, include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or intentional overdosages with Aripiprazole alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information about the efficacy of a haemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole, it is unlikely that haemodialysis is useful in the treatment of overdosing, as Aripiprazol has a high plasma performance.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiranzol in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is mediated by the combination of a partially antagonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1 receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazol in vitro showed a high affinity for dopamine D2- and D3-receptor and serotonin 5HT1 and 5HT2a-receptor as well as a moderate affinity to dopamine D4, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1-adrenergic and histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for 2 weeks of healthy subjects, the positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction of the binding of 11C Racloprid, a D2 / D3-receptor ligands, at the nucleus caudus and on the Putbeam.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term trials (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol showed statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a half-surgery-controlled study, 52 percent of responder patients who had a response to study medication in week 52 were similar in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measuring scales, defined as secondary study objectives, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- depression rate scale, showed significantly stronger improvement than at haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study for 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return, which was at 34% in the Aripirozol group and 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an osheapin-controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, involving 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was, significantly fewer patients had a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of approximately ca.).</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy trials with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazol showed a superiority compared to placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial for 3 weeks with fixed doses with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazol showed no superiority compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy trials over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic traits, Aripiprazol showed a effectiveness in week 3 versus placebo, comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In week 12, Aripiprazol showed a comparable share of patients suffering from symptomatic remission of the mania such as lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which in some cases did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the companion therapy with Aripiprazol showed superiority in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension period of 74 weeks for manic patients who achieved remission with Aripiprazol during a phase of stabilization before randomisation, Aripiprazol was superior to placebo with regard to the prevention of a bipolar return, mainly in the prevention of a reversal in the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies the enzyme CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxyellation of Aripiprazole, the N-dealkylamation is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination time is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazol for extensive metabolism via CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours at 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolicates via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazol there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, and pharmacokinetical examination of schizophrenia showed no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A population-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics showed no indication of clinically significant differences in ethnicity or the impact of smoking on pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiranzol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose trial in patients with various hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of the liver function to the pharmacokinetics of Aripilauzole and Dehydro-Aripilauzl, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on the conventional studies on safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data showed no particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were only observed in dosages or exposures that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans, therefore they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent borrocine-toxin-toxicity (Lipofuscin-pigment accumulation and / or parenchycell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans) and an increase of adrenal rinds carcinomas and combined adrenal-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose for humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholelithiasis was found as a result of the precipitation of sulfate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazol in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1 to 3 times the middle steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16- to 81fold the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="98">However, at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy- Aripilauzole were no more than 6% of the concentrations observed in the study for 39 weeks in the gall of monkeys and are far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits these effects were observed after dosages leading to expositions of the 3 and 11 times the middle steady state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="143">Abilify injection solution is used to quickly control detachment and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes of bipolar I disorder when oral therapy is not appropriate.</seg>
<seg id="144">Once it is clinically appropriate, the treatment with Aripiprazole injection solution should be terminated and started with oral application of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="145">To increase the resorption and to minimize variability, an injection into the M. deltoideus or deeply into the gluteus maximus muscle is recommended by circumventing adipous regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given depending on the individual clinical state taking into account the medicine already applied for maintenance or acute therapy (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If a further oral treatment is indicated with Aripiprazol, see the summary of the medicinal properties of Abilify tablet, abilify or Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no studies on the efficacy of Aripiranzol Injection solution in patients suffering from detachment and behavioural disorders caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiprazl injection solution, patients should be observed with regard to extreme sedation or a blood pressure drop (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Investigations on the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazol injections solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (prescribed or illegal drug).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazol should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, overflow disturbances), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including active and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during the treatment with Aripilauzl.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS are high fever, stiffness, changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, perspiration and arrhythmia).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydipsy, polyphenuria, polyphaggia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored regarding a deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the sedation was greater than that of Aripilauzl, in a study where healthy volunteers were used intramuscularly and at the same time received Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscularly.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripilauzole, but this effect is not considered clinically relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">CYP2D6 'Bad' (= 'poor') Metabolizing can result in a common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV- proteinase inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After replacing the CYP2D6- or 3A4-inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be lifted to the dose level prior to the start of the adjuvant therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscularly received, the intensity of the sedation was greater than that of Aripiprazol's allotted gift.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following side effects were more common in clinical trials (≥ 1 / 100) compared to placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria: common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) in clinical trials (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study for 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients under Aripilauzol- and 13.1% in patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients with Aripilauzol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for patients suffering from Aripirozol treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups in Aripilauzole and Placebo, with potentially clinically significant changes to routinely controlled laboratory parameters, showed no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases in CPK (creatinphosphokinase), transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripilauzole compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">The side effects that can occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, and also reported in the treatment with Aripilauzole, include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and varicity, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural dysfunction was the Aripiranzol injection solution associated with statistically significant greater improvements of detachment / behavioural disorders compared to placebo and was similar to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as detachment and behavioural disorders, the Aripiranzol injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in symptoms regarding detachment and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The mean improvement from the baseline on the PANSS Excitement Component score at the primary 2-hour end point was 5,8 for placebo, 9,6 for Lorazepam and 8,7 for Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe nausea, similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population, but a statistical significance could be determined on the basis of a decreased patient count.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term trials (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a half-surgery-controlled study, 52 percent of responder patients who had a response to study medication in week 52 were similar in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% (oral) and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measuring scales, defined as secondary study objectives, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg-depression rate scale, showed significantly stronger improvement than at haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">Placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return, which was 34% in the Aripilauzol- (oral) group and 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an osheapin-controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, involving 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was, significantly fewer patients had a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of approximately ca.).</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which in some cases did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the companion therapy with Aripiprazol showed superiority in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study extension for manic patients who achieved remission with Aripiprazol during a phase of stabilization before randomisation, Aripiprazol was superior to placebo with regard to the prevention of a bipolar return, mainly in the prevention of a reversal in the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">The Aripiprazol AUC in the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection 90% larger the AUC after administration of the same dose as tablet; systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy subjects, the average time was 1 to 3 hours before reaching the maximum plasma level.</seg>
<seg id="184">The administration of Aripiprazol injections was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated administration in a systemic exposure (AUC), intramuscularly in 15- and 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies on reproductive toxicity after intravenous application no safety-related concerns about maternal exposure, the 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbits) were above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies with Aripiprazol (oral) for safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data showed no particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were only observed in dosages or exposures that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure of humans; therefore they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal ringene toxicity (Lipofuscin-pigment accumulation and / or parenchyma cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans) and an increase of adrenal-state-state exposure (AUC) at 60 mg / kg / day (10 times the middle-state-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose for humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">In addition, a cholelithiasis was determined as a result of the precipitation of sulfate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazol in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1 to 3 times the middle-state-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16- to 81-fold the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2.</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, of which about three quarters had previously had an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in alluvial administration or as monotherapy) was compared with a drug containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">Overall, in the main study 72 (31%) of the 229 with Abraxane treated patients treated the treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of the 225 patients receiving conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="270">Only those patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer were not able to make a difference between the efficacy indicators, such as time to deterioration of the disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">On the other hand, patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer were shown in regards to these indicators that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It may also not be used in patients who have low neutrophils in the blood before the treatment begins.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) noted that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel drug-containing drugs and that contrary to other drugs containing paclitaxel, it does not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">January 2008, the European Commission granted the company Abraxis BioScience Limited approving the launching of Abraxane in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients in whom the first-line treatment for metastatic disease has failed and is not shown for a standard anthracyline-containing therapy (see also section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophils &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during the Abraxane therapy, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series.</seg>
<seg id="277">In the case of sensory Neuropathie Grade 3, the treatment must be interrupted until an improvement is reached to grade 1 or 2, and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="278">There is currently no adequate data for dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impairment of liver function (see section 4.4. and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="279">No studies were conducted in patients with impaired renal function and there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adaptation in patients with impairment of renal function (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="280">Abraxane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="281">Abraxane is an albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation of Paclitaxel, which could have much other pharmacological characteristics than other formulations of Paclitaxel (see section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="282">If an allergic reaction occurs, the medicine should be removed immediately and a symptomatic treatment should be initiated, and the patient must not be treated with paclitaxel again.</seg>
<seg id="283">In patients no further abrasion-cycles should be initiated until the neutrophils count rises to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the platelet number has increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver function disorders (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with abrasion.</seg>
<seg id="285">While a kardiotoxicity associated with Abraxane was not detected, cardiac incidents in the indicated patient population are not unusual, especially in patients with previous anthracycline treatment or underlying heart or lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">If nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea occur in patients after the application of Abraxane, they can be treated with the usual anti-methods and constipation.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abrasion should not be applied to pregnant women or women in childbearing age, who do not practice effective contraception, except the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women at childbearing age should use a reliable contraception method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients who are treated with Abraxane are advised to not give birth to a child during and up to six months after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised against the treatment of sperm conserving, since the treatment with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversibly infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects like tiredness (very common) and dizziness (often) that can affect the perspiration and the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="292">Listed below are the most common and most significant incidents of adverse events reported in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated in the pivotal Phase III study once every three weeks at 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most prominent hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 shows the side effects associated with the administration of Abraxane as monotherapy at each dose and indication in trials (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 10); often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); very rare (≥ 1 / 10,000); very rare (≥ 1 / 10.000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate hydrogenase in blood, increased creatine in blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphaggia, flatulence, tongue-burning, dry mouth, aching gums, loose stool, oesophagitis, pain in the lower abdomen, sores in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the thorax wall, weakness of muscles, neck pain, muscle spasms, muscle spasms, pain in skeletal musculature, joint pain, discomfort in limbs, muscle weakness Very frequent:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">As these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual incidence are possible and no causal connection with these events has been established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an anti-microtubules ingredient that promotes the positioning of microtubules from the tubulbules and stabilizes microtubules by inhibiting their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubulous network, which is essential for the vital interphase and mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin mediates the transcytosis of plasma components into endothelial cells and in the framework of in-vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel through endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transenithelial transport is mediated by the gp-60-albuminrezeptor and, due to the albuminous protein SPARC (sected protein acidic rich in cysteine), a paclitaxel accumulation occurs in the area of the tumor.</seg>
<seg id="306">The use of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single-arm unmatched studies and 454 patients treated in a randomized phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study 43 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 as infusion was used over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicentre study was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer, who received a monotherapy with paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in form of solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour infusion with premedication for the prevention of an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of abrasion 260 mg / m2 as a 30 minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had a negative general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had previously received no chemotherapy, 27% had only adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only for metastatic disease and 19% for metastatic disease and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the overall response rate and time until progression-free survival and progression-free survival for patients receiving first-line therapy are stated below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to paclitaxel was evaluated by improving one degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neuropathy with grade 3 at a time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy towards sinking on baseline based on the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 courses of treatment was not evaluated and remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the overall Paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 were obtained in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The Exposure Exposure (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analogous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 According to the intravenous administration of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multiphase way.</seg>
<seg id="318">The average distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume indicates a far-reaching extravascular allocation and / or soft tissue linking of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study involving patients with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel after IV-30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane were compared with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent-containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">After the Abraxane administration, the paclitaxel Clearance was higher (43%) than after a solvent containing paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers, it is reported that paclitaxel is primarily metabolized to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value for cumulative urinary excretion was 4% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, indicating a far-reaching non-renal clearance.</seg>
<seg id="323">Over 75 years of age, however, only a few data are available, since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>

<seg id="359">"" "this means that Abseamed is similar to a biological drug already approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same substance (also called" "" "reference medicinal products" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood-blood values, in which complications may occur in connection with blood transfusion if a blood donor is not possible before the procedure and a loss of blood from 900 to 1,800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">Treatment with abseamed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with disorders indicated by the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who wish to make their own blood donors, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be made by the patient or his supervisor, provided that they have received appropriate instructions.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic kidney insufficiency and in patients receiving chemotherapy, the hemoglobin values should always be at the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients must be checked prior to treatment in order to ensure that no iron deficiency is present and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients who receive chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia may be caused by an erythropoietal deficiency, or that the body does not adequately respond to the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the results of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced to the formation of epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared to a Vene in a primary study involving 479 patients suffering from anaemia caused by kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected Eprex / Erypo into a vein for at least eight weeks before either switching to streamed or receiving Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in hemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of submaramed under the skin were studied with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study involving patients suffering from anaemia caused by kidney problems, the hemoglobin values of patients who were switched to Abseamed were maintained to the same degree as in those patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, the patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0,063 g / dl of the initial value of 12,0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which may occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, pungent migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as injections under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that it does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that for Abseamed under the European Union regulations it was established that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company, which produces abseamed, will provide information packages for the medical professionals in all Member States, including information on the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission granted the company Medice Medicinal Pütter GmbH & Co KG approving the marketing of Abseamed in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion needs in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphomas or multiple myeloma, which receive chemotherapy and where the risk of transfusion exists due to the general condition (e.g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia at the beginning of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">The treatment should only be carried out in patients with moderate anemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8.1 mmol / l], if blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient, in case of planned larger surgical procedures, which require a large blood volume (4 or more units of blood in men; 5 or more units of blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">Abseamed can be applied before a large elective orthopaedic intervention in adults with no iron deficiency, where a high risk of transfusion complications is expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml may not be applied to an autologous blood donation program.</seg>
<seg id="385">The haemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for paediatric patients, where the haemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease; therefore, the doctor needs to evaluate the individual clinical course and condition of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in haemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values can be observed over or below the haemoglobin target concentration in a patient.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the target concentration of haemoglobin of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent hemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose which is required for control of anaemia and anemia.</seg>
<seg id="392">These clinical findings suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients with initial anaemia less difficult (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">These clinical findings suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial anaemia is less difficult (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week using intravenous application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Symptoms of anemia and sequelae may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease; therefore, the doctor needs to evaluate the individual clinical course and condition of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="396">In view of this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the target concentration of haemoglobin of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose which is required for the control of the anaemia.</seg>
<seg id="398">If the hemoglobin value is increased by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the coefficient of reticulosis by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl against the initial value, the dose of 150 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the hemoglobin increase is increased &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the coefficient of recurrences &lt; 0,62 mmol / l), the dose should be raised to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.U. / kg three times a week the hemoglobin value ≥ ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the reticulosis value increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl, the dose of 300 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the hemoglobin value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) resp. the reticulocyte number by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl against the initial value, a response to epoetin-alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be interrupted.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anemia (haematocrit 33-39%), in which the precautionary storage of ≥ 4 blood conserae is required, received a dose of 600 I.U. / kg of body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">The iron substitution should start as early as possible - e.g. several weeks before the beginning of the autologous blood donation program, so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the abseamed therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg Epsom alfa, which should be given once a week over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">In this case, epoetin alfa should be preoperatively 300 I.U. / kg on 10 consecutive days, on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection at the end of dialysis can be given via the tube of a fistula needle, followed by 10 ml isotonic saline solution to flush the hose and ensure sufficient injections of the drug into the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients suffering from erythropoetin with any erythropoietin on erythroblasturenia (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive a streamed or other erythropoetin (see section 4.4 - erythroblastopenia).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within one month before treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thromboembolism (e.g. anamnestic known venous thromboembolism).</seg>
<seg id="409">In patients who are envisioned for a major elective orthopedic surgery and who cannot take part in an autologous blood donation program, the application of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in the following pre-, accompanying or underlying disease: severe coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial occlusion, vascular disease of the otitis or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with recently introduced heart attack or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastopenia (PRCA) Very rare was reported about the appearance of an antibody-mediated PRCA after monate- to years of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of effect, defined as reduction of haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the reticulocyte value should be determined and the usual causes for a non-response (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminiuminescence, infections or inflammations, blood loss and hemolysis) are examined.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the anti-erythropoetin antibodies (&lt; 20,000 / mm3 or &lt; 0.5%), the thrombocyte and leukocyte figures are normal, and if no other reason of an effective loss is found, the anti-erythropoetin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone marrow should be considered for the diagnosis of a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">Data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients with a risk for antibody-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic kidney insufficiency, the upper limit of the haemoglobin target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical trials, increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoic-stimulating agents (ESA) were given with a hemoglobin target concentration of over 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit attributed to the administration of epoeas if the hemoglobin concentration is increased by the concentration required to control the symptoms of anaemia and the avoidance of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The haemoglobin increase should be about 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month in order to minimize the risk of an increase in hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic kidney failure and clinically evident coronary heart disease or stowage insufficiency, the upper limit of the haemoglobin target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which is not yet dialysis, is not accelerated progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">For tumour patients under chemotherapy, a 2-3-week delay between epoetin alfa and erythropoetin response should be taken into account for evaluating the therapy efficiency of epoetin alfa (patients who may need to be transacted).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is exceeded than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy-related anemia - dose adjustment with the goal of holding the haemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to apply recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk assessment involving the involvement of the respective patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are envisioned for a larger elective orthopaedic surgery, the cause of anaemia should be examined and treated accordingly before the beginning of epoetin-alfa therapy.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients undergoing a larger elective orthopaedic surgery should have appropriate thromboseprophylaxis, since they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially with a underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular events can be assumed when treating with epoetin alfa for patients with an output threshold of &gt; 13 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled trials, epoetine was not proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy was returned if a hemoglobin target concentration of 12-14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l) was targeted</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporindosage should be adapted to the rising haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies on tumor tissues, there are no indications of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF regarding hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">Through thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischemia, cerebrovascular events (cerebral haemorrhage, cerebral infarction), ischemic thromboses, pulmonary thromboses, aneurythromboses and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under erythropoietin treatment, so also patients under epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during the treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent rise in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovascular events (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients treated with erythropoetines.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of erythropoetin treatment, surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations can lead to thrombotic and vascular complications.</seg>
<seg id="434">The genetically derived epoetin alfa is glycosilized and is identical with the endogenous human erythropoietin, which was isolated from the urine of anemic patients regarding the amino acids and the carbohydrate content.</seg>
<seg id="435">It could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa specifically stimulates the erythropoesis and does not affect leukopovese.</seg>
<seg id="436">389 patients with hemostasis (221 multiple myelomes, 144 non-Hodgkin- lymphomas and 24 further hemoglobsters) and 332 patients with solid tumours (172 breast cancer tumors, 23 lung cancer, 22 prostate carcinomas, 21 gastrointestinal carcinomas, and 30 more).</seg>

<seg id="438">Survival and progression were examined in five major controlled trials with a total of 2833 patients; four of these studies were double-blind placebo-controlled studies and</seg>
<seg id="439">In the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin and the control patient.</seg>
<seg id="440">In these studies, patients with recombinant human erythropoetin showed a more consistent, statistically significant higher mortality compared to controls due to a number of common malignancies.</seg>
<seg id="441">Overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thromboses and related complications in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin and with controls.</seg>
<seg id="442">There is an increased risk of thromboembolic events in tumour patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="443">It is not clear how far these results can be transferred to the use of recombinant human erythropoetin in tumour patients who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a hemoglobin value below 13 g / dl, as a few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data.</seg>
<seg id="444">Epoetin alfa provisions after repeated intravenous application showed a half-life of about 4 hours in healthy subjects and a somewhat prolonged half-life of about 5 hours in patients with renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="445">After subcutaneous injection, the serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the serum levels achieved after intravenous injection.</seg>
<seg id="446">There is no accumulation: the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift.</seg>
<seg id="447">Bone marmonary fibrosis is a well known complication of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be due to secondary hyperparathyreoidism or unknown factors.</seg>
<seg id="448">In a study of hematalysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for three years, the incidence of bone marital fibrosis was not increased compared to the control group with dialysis patients who were not treated with epoetin alfa.</seg>

<seg id="576">The main indicator of the efficacy was whether the saline of alkaline phosphatase in serum (an enzyme that breaks down bone substance) in the blood returned to normal or at least 75% compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study with older women, the risk of eddy fractures in patients under Acrelia (excluding other osteoporosis therapies) was reduced by 70% over a period of three years compared to the patients.</seg>
<seg id="578">The risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41% compared to all patients under Acupa (with or without other osteoporosis therapies).</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study involving men and women with hip fractures, 9% of patients under Acupa had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of the placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most Acupa side effects occur within the first three days after infusion and are less common in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to zoledronylic acid or other bisphosphonate or any other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients at Aclasta are subject to the risk of kidney problems, reactions to the infusion point and osteoarthritis (death of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">The manufacturer of acetoba provides educational material for doctors who prescribe acetoba for the treatment of osteoporosis, which contains instructions on how to apply the medicine, as well as similar material for patients in whom the side effects of the drug are explained and referred to when they should contact the doctor.</seg>

<seg id="588">Treatment of osteoporosis • in postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, intravenous infusion of 5 mg of aclasta is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture, the administration of the infusion of acetoba is recommended two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip fracture (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Aclasta should be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After a treatment of the disease Paget with Aclasta, a long period of remission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly advisable to ensure a sufficient supply of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget, twice daily at least 500 mg of elemental calcium, for at least 10 days after the application of Aclasta (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.E. orally or intramuscular Vitamin D is recommended before the first infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Acupa may be reduced by the administration of acetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of acetamol.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with renal dysfunction (see section 4.4) In patients with a creatinine clearance &lt; 35 ml / min, it is not recommended that there are limited clinical experience for this group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="597">Dosage adjustment is not necessary since the bioavailability, distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents of Aclasta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age, since data on safety and efficacy are missing.</seg>
<seg id="599">In patients with severe renal insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min), only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">A pre-existing hypokalcemia is to be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before the therapy starts (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid enforestation of the effect of Zoledronic acid on bone remodeling, a temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalemia can develop, whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the infusion of acetlasta (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly advisable to ensure a sufficient supply of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget, twice daily at least 500 mg of elemental calcium, for at least 10 days after the application of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene) should undergo a dental examination with appropriate preventive dental treatment before using bisphosphonates.</seg>
<seg id="604">No data is available for patients who require dental intervention, whether the interruption of treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteodeficiency in the jaw region.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of acetaminophage may be reduced by the administration of acetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of acetamol (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">Cases of atrial fibrillation reported as serious side-effects of atrial fibrillation were increased (1.3%) (51 out of 3,862) compared to those receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In the osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]), the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Acelasa (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>
<seg id="609">Frequent (≥ 1 / 10), frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) adverse drug effects are listed in table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Renal dysfunction Zoledronc was associated with renal dysfunction, which expressed itself as a decrease in the renal function (i.e. an increase in serum creatinine) and in rare cases referred to as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">Changes in the creatinine clearing (measured annually prior to administration) and kidney failure and a limited renal function were comparable in a clinical study of osteoporosis over three years, comparable between the placebo and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum creatine within 10 days after the application was observed at 1.8% of patients treated with acupa compared to 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings, the transient asymptomatic calcium values, which were below the normal fluctuation range (less than 2.10 mmol / l), occurred in 2.3% of patients treated with aclasta in a large clinical trial compared to 21% of patients treated with aclasta in the disease-paget trials.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the postmenopausal osteoporosis study, in the study to avoid clinical fractures following a hip fracture and in the morbus-Paget studies (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures after a recently littled hip fracture, the vitamin D mirrors were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before administration of acetone (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions After the administration of citric acid in a large clinical study was reported about local reactions at the infusion site, such as redness, swelling and / or pain, reported (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteosecrosis in the jaw region has been reported, especially in cancer patients, through osteonecrosis (primary in the jaw region), which were treated with bisphosphonates, including zoledronlic acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental intervention.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 patients with 7,736 patients showed osteoarthritis in the jaw area of a patient treated with acupa and in a patient treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="620">In the case of an overdose that leads to a clinically relevant hypokalemia, a balance can be achieved by adding oral calcium and / or an intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical effectiveness in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was indicated in postmenopausal women (7,736 women between 65 and 89 years) with either a BMD-T-Score or a BMD-T-Score for the Schenkelhal ≤ -2.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric fractures of the body were significantly reduced over a period of three years as well as the frequency of one or more new spinal fractures after one year (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclasta-treated patients aged 75 and older had a 60% reduced risk of vertebral fractures compared to placebo-patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Aclasta showed a constant effect over three years, which resulted in reduced risk of hip fractures in a 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Acupa increased bone density in lumbar vertebrate, hip and distal radius compared to placebo treatment significantly at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase of the bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the entire hip by 6.0%, the thighs by 5.1% and the distal radius of 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology in 152 postmenopausal osteoporosis patients who were treated with acupa (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70) were taken from the pelvic base one year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer tomography (µCT) analysis showed an increase in the trabecular bone volume and the preservation of trabecular bone architecture in patients treated with Acupa compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone replacement markers The bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal propetide of type I- collagen (P1NP) in the serum and the beta-C telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were determined in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during study duration.</seg>
<seg id="630">The treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Aclasta significantly reduced BSAP by 30% after 12 months compared to baseline and was held at 28% below the initial value for up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52% below the initial value to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55% below the initial value to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D mirrors were not routinely measured but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 I.U. orally or intramuscular) 2 weeks prior to infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">The overall mortgages were 10% (101 patients) in the treated group compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON-RFT study, compared to placebo treatment, the BMD increased the BMD at the total thigh and neck area at all times.</seg>
<seg id="636">The treatment resulted in 24 months compared to placebo treatment to increase BMD by 5.4% of the total hip and 4.3% at the cockle's neck.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical effectiveness in men In the HORIZON RFT trial, 508 men were randomised and in 185 patients the BMD was assessed after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% in the treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308) the annual dose of acetone compared to the once weekly administration of alendronate was not inferior to the percentage change of the lumbar vertebrae BMD after 24 months compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Morbus Paget of the bone Aclasta was examined in patients and patients over 30 years with radiological confirmed, mainly light to moderately heavy Morbus Paget of the bone (mean serum levels of alkaline phosphatase corresponding to the 2.6-fold age-specific upper normal value when taking into the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg of Zoledronate in comparison to the intake of 30mg of Risedronat once a day for 2 months was proven in two six months comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to baseline for Aclasta and Risedronat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as responds at the end of the six-month main study (responded to therapy) could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 with aclasta and 107 with Risedronat patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response in 141 of the patients treated with Risedronat could be maintained for an average duration of the follow-up period of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">Single and multiple 5 and 15 minute infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of zoledronlic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data, which proved to be dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, the plasma levels rapidly decreased to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h, followed by a long-lasting, very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Fast bi-phase disappearance from the large cycle with half-life t ½ α 0.24 and t ½ β 1,87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elift survival time t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early stages of distribution (α and β, with the above t ½ -values) probably represent the rapid resorption in the bones and excretion via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 h 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in urine, while the rest is mainly related to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body clearance is 5,04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains unaffected by sex, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion-time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Zoledron's acid concentration by 30% at the end of infusion but had no effect on the surface below the curve (plasma concentration versus time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished clearance of substances metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes is unlikely, because Zoledronyric acid is not metabolized by humans and because it is a weak or even no direct and / or irreversible, drug-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal clearance of the Zoledronic acid correlated with the Kreatinin Clearance, 75 ± 33% of the creatinin-Clearance, and was 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min) in the 64 examined patients.</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a slight (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate renal dysfunction down to a creatinin clearance of up to 35 ml / min does not require any dose adjustment of the zoledcitric acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">As for severe renal dysfunction (creatinin- cleance &lt; 30 ml / min) only limited data is available, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In dogs, single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on the AUC were the 6fold of the recommended human therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Chronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous application, the renal tolerability of zoledronyric acid in rats was administered by doses of 0.6 mg / kg as a 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, administered in intervals of 2-3 weeks (a cumulative dose corresponding to the 7x of the human-therapeutic exposure related to the AUC).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated exposure in accumulated exposures that exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure, toxicological effects of other organs, including gastrointestinal tract and liver, and intravenous injection.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common cause of repeated use was an increased primary spongiosa in the metaphysisis of long bones in animals during the growth period with almost all dosages, a finding that reflects the pharmacological, antiresorptive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">Rats observed a teratogenicity in dosages of 0,2 mg / kg as outer and inner (visceral) abnormalities and such of the skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed in rabbits, although the maternal toxicity of 0.1 mg / kg was pronounced as a result of low serum-calcium levels.</seg>

<seg id="671">Zoledronic acid is a substance of a substance called bisphosphonate and is used for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, the osteoporosis in men and the bone pathogen of the bone.</seg>
<seg id="672">Declining blood levels of sex hormones, especially estrogen formed from androgens, play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">In the case of Morbus Paget, bone remodeling takes place too quickly, and new bone material is constructed unordered, making the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta works by normalizing the bone reconstruction back to normal, thereby ensuring normal bone formation and reinforces strength to the bone.</seg>
<seg id="675">If you are undergoing dental treatment or undergoing dental surgery, tell your doctor that you are treated with Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="676">When using aclasta with other medicines please inform your doctor, pharmacist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / used medication even if it is not prescription medicines.</seg>
<seg id="677">For your doctor it is especially important to know if you are taking pharmaceuticals from which it is known that they are damaging the kidneys.</seg>

<seg id="749">The present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has evaluated the studies conducted to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) in which metformin (a diabetes medicine) is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be used in addition to metformin in patients (particularly overweight patients) who cannot be satisfied with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dosage.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with sulfonyglycaemia or insulin, the previous dose of the sulfonyamine or insulin can be retained with the beginning of the Actos treatment, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); this should reduce the dose of the sulfonysulphide or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases, which makes Type 2 diabetes better adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients, the efficacy of actos was studied in tripleotherapy; the patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonyl resin, in addition they received either actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a reduction of the HbA1c value, suggesting that the blood sugar levels were lowered from 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of an additional dose of actos for the existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonysulphide in a reduction of HbA1c values was 0.94%, whereas the additional dose of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study where the combination of Actos and insulin was examined in 289 patients, the patients receiving Actos in addition to insulin had a decrease in HbA1c values from 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were visual disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypoesthesia (decreased sensitivity to irritation).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos must neither be used in patients who may be hypersensitive to pioglitazone or any of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone levels - in blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that actos should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin in patients in the sole use of monotherapy, in which metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited approving the marketing of Actos in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">"" "the tablets are white to whitish, round, arched and carry on one side the marking" "" "15" "" "and on the other side the inscription" "" "Actos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and where metformin is unsuitable due to contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">No data is available for use of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, therefore the use in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are at risk of at least one risk factor (e.g. early cardiac infarction or symptomatic coronary artery disease), the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserves.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in reports of congestive heart failure, which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased initial liver enzymatic values (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If ALT mirrors are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that indicate hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzyme values must be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision to continue the treatment of the patient with pioglitazone should be conducted before the clinical assessment before the laboratory parameters.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with pioglitazone a dose-dependent weight gain has been demonstrated that can aggravate adiposity deposits and in some cases associated with a fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of hemodilution, a small reduction of medium hemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and hematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred under the therapy with pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3-4% and hematocrits by 3-4% and hematocrits by 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive pioglitazone as oral two or three-way combination therapy with a sulfonyotropic substance or as a secondary combination therapy with insulin are the risk of a dose-dependent hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch was reported under treatment with thiazole indiions, including pioglitazone, about an occurrence or deterioration of diabetic macular edema with a reduction of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct link between taking Pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but it is advisable to be aware of the possibility of macular edema when patients report disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary report of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The resulting fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patients years for women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient-years for women who were treated with a comparative medicalation.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of over 3.5 years of study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient-years) compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient-years) in patients who were treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wants a pregnancy or this occurs, the treatment is to be removed (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies to investigate the interactions have shown that Pioglitazone exerts no relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) resulted in an increase of the AUC of pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a 54% reduction in the AUC of pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that the treatment with pioglitazone reduces the insulin resistance resulting from pregnancy and reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (not invaluable in present data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turgor and refraction index of the lens, as observed in other hypoglycaemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with pioglitazone ALT ascents were more than three times the upper limit of the normal range, but less often than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonyl resin.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease, the incidence of severe heart failure under pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than placebo, if pioglitazone or pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch it has rarely been reported about heart failure under spoglitazone, but more often when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summarizing analysis of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in groups treated with pioglitazone treated groups and over 7,400 patients in patients treated with comparative meditations.</seg>
<seg id="796">Over a period of 3.5 years of the ProActive study, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative medial.</seg>
<seg id="797">In the case of taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days did not appear any symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone appears to be activated by activation of specific core receptors (PPAR-γ) (PPAR-γ), which in the animal model results in increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that pioglitazone reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose level in the case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with pioglitazone versus Gliclaids as monotherapy has been carried out over two years in order to investigate the time until after the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time of two years after the start of therapy, blood glucose monitoring (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) was maintained by pioglitazone at 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclacide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study of 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was insufficient with insulin despite three months of optimization was randomized to pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazone, the average HbA1c was 0.45%, compared to those who continued to receive insulin; a reduction of insulin dosage in the treated group treated with pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">Clinical trials for a year showed a statistically significant decrease of albumin / creatinin quotients compared to baseline scores.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18-week study of type 2 diabetes patients.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials compared to placebo, a reduction of total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol level as well as slightly, clinically no significantly increased LDL cholesterol was observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, pioglitazone reduced total plasmcerides and free fatty acids compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclaids and increased the HDL cholesterol level.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, no statistically significant rise in LDL cholesterol was observed in Pioglitazone, while metformin and Gliclaids were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of 20 weeks, pioglitazone not only reduced the triglyceride level, but also improved the postprandial elevated triglyceride levels, both by an effect on triglycerid absorption and hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease were randomized into groups who received either pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular treatment.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazone is quickly absorbed, where the peak concentrations of unaltered pioglitazone in the plasma are usually achieved within 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV is equivalent to the effectiveness of pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, it was demonstrated that Pioglitazone had no relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases or reduces the plasma concentration of Pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After the oral application of radioactively marked pioglitazone in humans the marker was found mainly in the decay (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma elimination time of unchanged pioglitazone amounts to 5-6 hours in humans, and the total active metabolite is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">Plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of oral clearance of the mother substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">Toxicological studies included mice, rats, dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with hemodilution, anemia and reversible eccentric hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that the treatment with pioglitazone reduces the insulin resistance resulting from the formation and reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years), increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumors (in male rats) of the urea epithelium were induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP) treatment with two other thiazole-indian led to increased frequency of colonic tumours.</seg>

<seg id="823">The resulting fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patients years for women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient-years for women who were treated with a comparative medicalation.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of over 3.5 years of study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient-years) compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient-years) in patients who were treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study over two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with each pioglitazone or Gliclaids were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical studies more than 1 year, there was a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinine quotients compared to baseline scores.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of 20 weeks, pioglitazone not only reduced the triglyceride level, but also improved the postprandial elevated triglyceride levels, both by an effect on triglycerid absorption and hepatic tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study missed the target with regard to its primary endpoint, which represented a combination of the total mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankle, coronary reascularisation and reascularisation of leg arteries, the results suggest that with the intake of pioglitazone no cardiovascular long-term risks are connected.</seg>

<seg id="874">Any change in strength, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (fast acting, biphasic, long-acting insulin, etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin or insulin analog) and / or manufacturing method (by recombinant DNA towards insulin of animal origin) can lead to a change in the dosage required.</seg>
<seg id="875">If a dose adjustment is necessary when changing to actraphane, it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients with hypoglycemic reactions following a change of animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or unlike their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Before traveling that go over several time zones, the patient should be advised to seek the advice of his doctor as such trips may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor must therefore take into account possible interactions during therapy and always ask his patients for other medications that they have taken.</seg>
<seg id="879">4 Both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, which may occur in a non-sufficiently controlled diabetic therapy, increase the risk of abnormalities and fertility in utero.</seg>
<seg id="880">Severe hypoglycemias can lead to unconsciousness and / or seizures and end with temporary or permanent dysfunctions of brain function and even death.</seg>
<seg id="881">Disorders of the nervous system Occasional - Peripheral neuropathy A rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with discomfort known as acute painful neuropathy and usually reversible.</seg>

<seg id="884">General disorders and complaints at the venue - Local hypersensitivity reactions at the injection site During insulin therapy, local hypersensitivity reactions (redness, swelling, itching, pain, hematoma) may occur at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="885">Disorders of the immune system Actually - Urticaria, Exanthem Very rare - anaphylactic reactions symptoms of generalized hypersensitivity, including generalized skin rash, itching, sweating, gastrointestinal disorders, angioneurotic edema, breathing difficulties, palpitations, low blood pressure and fainting / unconscious.</seg>
<seg id="886">However, hypoglycaemia can develop gradually: • Light hypoglycemias can be treated by the oral supply of glucose or sugary foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should always have grape sugars, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juices. • Serious hypoglycemias with unconsciousness are treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by a proven aid or by glucose which is given intravenously by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect begins within half an hour, the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total active duration is up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The resorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with rapid or delayed resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of splitting (hydrolysis) places on the human insulin molecule were taken into consideration; none of the metabolites formed by the split is active.</seg>
<seg id="891">Based on the conventional studies on safety macology, toxicity in repeated application, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data does not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="892">It is recommended - after the Actrophane flow bottle is taken from the refrigerator - to increase the temperature of the insulin at room temperature (not above 25 ° C) before it is resusded according to the instructions for use for the first use.</seg>

<seg id="1220">There were no clinically significant differences in the percentage return of serum levels in test subjects, regardless of kidney function (58% in the group with normal renal function and 55% in the group with severe kidney function disorders).</seg>
<seg id="1221">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with serum resin concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl of 40% of patients (APEX and FACT study) had a serum gum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of study (baseline).</seg>
<seg id="1222">The data from the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent decrease in serum levels of serum levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l), so that less than 3% of patients needed 16-24 treatment against a gout (i.e. more than 97% of patients did not need treatment against poisonous feed).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in the gout node-size, which in 54% of patients had a complete disappearance of the gout nodes by month 24.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Increased TSH- values (&gt; 5.5 µg / ml) were observed in patients who received long-term treatment with Febuxostat (5.0%) and also in patients who received allopurinol (5.8%) in open long-term extension studies (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy subjects, the maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) from Febuxostat increased by simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For dosages between 120 mg and 300 mg, a rise in the AUC is observed for Febuxostat, which is larger than the dose-proportional increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily, the Cmax amounts to about 2.8-3.2 µg / ml and 5.0-5.3 µg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1228">However, no clinically significant changes were observed in the percentage decline of serum levels of serum levels if this was tested (multiple doses of 80 mg).</seg>

<seg id="1231">In vitro studies in human liver microsomols showed that these oxidative metabolites are predominantly formed by CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C8 or CYP2C9, and that Febuxostats curonid is primarily produced by UGT 1A1, 1A8 and 1A9.</seg>
<seg id="1232">After taking an 80 mg dose of 14C-labeled Febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was found in the urine as unchanged Febuxostat (30%), the known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%) and other unknown metabolites (3%).</seg>
<seg id="1233">In addition to excretion via urine, approximately 45% of the dose in the stool found itself as unchanged Febuxostat (12%), acetylglucosamine of the active substance (1%), its well-known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%) and other unknown metabolites (7%).</seg>
<seg id="1234">Special patient group renal insufficiency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild, moderate or severe kidney failure, the Cmax of Febuxostat did not change compared to subjects with normal kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The average total AUC of Febuxostat increased by about 1.8 times of 7.5 m g / ml in the group with normal renal function to 13.2 μ / h / ml in the group with severe kidney function.</seg>

<seg id="1320">In the group treated with Alendronat, a 48% reduction in the placebo group was achieved by 48% (Alendronat 3.2% compared to placebo, 6.2%) in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more spinal fractures.</seg>
<seg id="1321">In the two-year extension of these studies, the BMD of the BMD of the spine and the Trochanter continued to uphold; the BMD of the femur and the entire body was maintained.</seg>
<seg id="1322">Fit consisted of two placebo-controlled trials in which Alendronate was taken daily (5 mg. a day for 2 years and then 10 mg daily, either over 1 or 2 years):</seg>
<seg id="1323">In this study, the daily dose of Alendronat reduced the occurrence of at least one new eddy fracture by 47% (Alendronat 7.9% compared to placebo 15.0%).</seg>
<seg id="1324">Resorption Based on an intravenous reference dose, the median oral bioavailability of alendronate in women was 0.64% for doses between 5 and 70 mg after nocturnal fasting and two hours before receiving a standardised breakfast.</seg>

<seg id="1411">Clinically relevant differences in the systemic exposure of tacrolimus can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects, including sub- or overimmunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; conversions of the formulation or the régime should only be carried out under close supervision of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of a switch to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic pharmaceutical supervision and corresponding dose adjustment must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advansf should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases and on blood-level determinations (see below) Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After switching from Prograf to Adventurf, the Tacrolimus Values should be checked before the conversion and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>

<seg id="1426">Heart transplantation In adult patients who are switched to advance, an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once a day.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant recipients though there is no clinical experience with an oral, pancreatic and colon transplanted patient, was performed in an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day, for pancreatic patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dosage adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood levels in the targeted area may require a reduction of the dose in patients with severe liver function disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Since the renal function does not influence the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, however, careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular determination of serum creatine level, calculation of the creatinine in the urine, and monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Changeover from Ciclosporin to Advagraph When switching from a Ciclosporin to a tacrolimus-based therapy, caution is required (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations for full blood pressure in full blood The dose should be based first and foremost on the clinical assessment of repulsion and tolerability in individual cases, taking full-blood-tacrolimus-talc controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tacrolimus test level during the first two weeks after transplantation followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-Talking levels of tacrolimus should also be controlled by prograf to advance, dose adjustment, immunosuppressive therapy or simultaneous use of substances that might alter the Tacrolimus blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advatef is a medicine with a low clearance, adaptations of the dose may take several days before the Steady State has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood level in the blood does not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the levels of Tacrolimus in full blood in the first time after liver transplantations usually lie in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and kidney and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events including graft rejection or other side effects which may occur as a result of tacrolimus sub- or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; conversions of the formulation or the régime should only be carried out under close supervision of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be refractory to other immunosuppressants, there are no clinical data for the retarded formulation advance.</seg>
<seg id="1442">There are no clinical data for the retarded formulation Advance for prophylaxis of transplant rejection in adult heart transplant recipients and graft recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions that can lead to a reduction of the Tacrolimus levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the consumption of herbal supplements, the St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum), or other plant remedies can be avoided during treatment with Advance (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is required, as the Tacrolimus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases a chamber or septum hypertrophie described as cardiomyopathy was to be observed under Prograf, which can therefore occur under agraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical interference are an already existing heart disease, treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver dysfunction, infections, fluid overload and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet light should be restricted due to the potential risk of malignant skin lesions by suitable clothing or use of a sun protection device with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who take Tacrolimus, symptoms of PRES such as headache, altered state of consciousness, convulsions and blurred vision, should be a radiological examination (e.g.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can influence the metabolism of tacrolimus and consequently increase or lower the blood values of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">Therefore, it is recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus blood levels with the simultaneous addition of substances that can alter the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the Tacrolimus dosage accordingly for maintaining even concentrations (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly distinctive interaction was achieved with antimycotics such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, Itraconazole and Voriconazole as well as with the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z.</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetics studies revealed that the rise in blood levels results mainly from the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus, caused by the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methyl prednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibition; therefore, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus with medicines which are metabolized by CYP3A4 can affect their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">As tacrolimus can reduce the Clearance of steroid contraceptives and thus increase the level of hormone exposition, it is especially cautious to make decisions about contraceptive measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal studies have shown that tacrolimus can potentially lessen the clearance of pentobarbital and phenazone and prolong its half-life.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of transplant patients have no indication that under tacrolimus in comparison to other immunosuppressants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy.</seg>

<seg id="1465">Infections and parasitic diseases As is well known among other highly effective immunosuppressants, patients who are treated with tacrolimus are often increased susceptibility to infections (viral, bacterial, mycotic, protozoal).</seg>
<seg id="1466">Cases of BK-Virus associated nephropathy and JC virus associated progressive multifocal leukencephalopathy (PML) were reported in patients with immunosuppressive therapy, including treatment with lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1467">It was reported on benign or malignant neoplasma including EBV- associated lymphoproliferative disorders and skin tumours associated with tacrolimus therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, low water solubility and the high binding of erythrocytes and plasma proteins, Tacrolimus can be assumed that tacrolimus is not dialytic.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The action mechanism and pharmacodynamic effects on the molecular level are likely to mediate the effects of tacrolimus through its binding to a cytosole protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for enriching the connection in the nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calciumrelated imitation of signal transduction pathways in the T cell and thus prevents transcription of a certain number of lymphocytes genes.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Tacrolimus suppresses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T-helper cells, further the formation of lymphokines (such as interleukin-2, interleukin-3 and γ-interferon) as well as the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="1472">In the first 24 weeks in the Advance Group (N = 237) 32.6% and in the Prograf group (N = 234), 12 confirmed cases were 29.3%.</seg>

<seg id="1476">Efficacy and safety of Prograf, Ciclosporin and Advance was compared in combination with Basiliximab antibody production, MMF and corticosteroids, in 638 de novo kidney transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The incidence of treatment failure after 12 months (defined as death, graft loss, biopsy-confirmed acute rejection or missing follow-up data) was 14.0% in the Prograf group (N = 212) and 17.0% in the Ciclosporin group (N = 212).</seg>
<seg id="1478">The treatment difference was -3.0% (Advance Ciclosporin) (95.2% confidence interval [-9.9%, 4.0%]) for Advansf vs Ciclosporin and -1.9% (Prograf Ciclosporin) [-8.9%, 5.2%]) for Prograf vs Ciclosporin.</seg>

<seg id="1481">175 lunged patients, 475 patients undergoing pancreatitis, were used in 630 cases following colon transplantation as primary immunosuppressant.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral prograf in these published studies outlined the observations in the large studies where prograf was used for primary immunosuppression in liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation in an interim analysis of a recently conducted, multicentre study with oral Prograf was reported over 110 patients who received either tacrolimus or Ciclosporin within a 1: 1 randomization.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Chronic graft rejection, bronchiolitis obliterans- syndrome, was less common in the first year after the transplant (2,86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after one year was 80.8% in the tacrolimus and 83% in the Ciclosporin group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; Abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the patients treated with tacrolimus, it came in 21.7% of the cases of the development of bronchiolitis obliterans compared to 38.0% under Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases where Ciclosporin had to be switched to tacrolimus (n = 13) was significantly greater (p = 0.02) than the number of patients who were switched from tacrolimus to Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which no acute transplant rejection occurred was greater after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in the lung transplanted patients of the Tacrolimus group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In a study, the frequency of the emergence of a bronchiolitis obliterated syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Pancreatic Plantation A multicentre study with oral Prograf was conducted on 205 patients who underwent a pancreatic and kidney transplantation following a randomised procedure of tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initialdose (per protocol) of tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then achieved to reach the desired valley level from 8 to 15 ng / ml on the 5th.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The published clinical results of a monocentric study of orally prograf as primary immunosuppressive after intestinal transplants showed an updatory survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Methods for early detection of Epstein-Barr (EBV) and CMV infections, bone marrow enlargement, additional administration of the interleukin-2 antagonist daclizumab, lower initial doses of tacrolimus, leading to lower doses of transplantation (Abu-Elmagd et al., Ann Surg 2001; 234: 404).</seg>
<seg id="1494">Factors such as a low haematocrit and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the disconnected fraction of tacrolimus or a reinforcement of the metabolism brought about by treatment with corticosteroids are intended to be responsible for the higher Clearance rates observed after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, whereby the excretion occurs mainly via the bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">For stable patients who were converted from Prograf (twice daily) to the dose of 1: 1 (mg: mg) relative to the total daily dose, systemic exposure to Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) was approximately 10% lower than under Prograf.</seg>
<seg id="1497">It is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tacrolimus test level during the first two weeks after transplantation followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1498">21 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be therapy-resistant to other immunosuppressants, there are no clinical data for the retarded formulation advance.</seg>
<seg id="1499">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical interference are an already existing heart disease, treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver dysfunction, infections, fluid overload and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1500">28 confirmed cases of abduction amounted to 32.6% in the first 24 weeks of the Advance Group (N = 237) and 29.3% in the Prograf group (N = 234).</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (a congenital blood clotting disorder caused by the lack of factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether advate is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, causing bleeding problems such as bleeding in the joints, muscles or inner organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but is produced according to a method called recombinant DNA technology:</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced to enable it to form the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is similar to another in the European Union called Recombinate, but is produced otherwise, so that the drug does not contain proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate haemophilia A, including a study involving 53 children under six years, the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the efficacy of advate in the prevention of bleeding was assessed in 86% of 510 new bleedings with "excellent" or "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of advate (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies to factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advate may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human coagulation factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein, or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted Baxter AG approval for the marketing of Advocates throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage and duration of substitution therapy depend on the severity of factor VIII deficiency, the location and extent of bleeding and the patient's clinical condition.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following haemorrhages, factor VIII activity should not fall below the indicated plasma levels (in% of the norm or in I.E. / dl) during the corresponding period.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injections every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute depression are removed.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) repeat until the risk for the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the treatment course, appropriate determination of factor VIII plasma levels is recommended for controlling the dose to be administered and the frequency of injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may differ in their response to factor VIII, various in vivo recovery and have different half-lives.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activity is not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled at a reasonable dose, a test must be carried out in order to detect an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures must be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The dose rate should depend on the patient's condition whereby a maximum dose rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a well known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always anti-coagulatory IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma by means of modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, where the risk within the first 20 exposure days is the largest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure days and anamnestic known inhibitor development, after switching from recombinant factor VIII-product to another, the recurrence of (low-trigen) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Because of the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs were inhibitors against Factor VIII (5 patients), all of which occurred in previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of formation of inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very common (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100), occasionally (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), not known (frequency based on available data is not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of each patient (234). the unexpected drop in the blood clotting factor VIII spiegels was performed postoperatively (10th - 14th post surgery) in a patient with continuous ADVATE infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">The blood clotting was maintained during the whole period and the factor VIII- mirror in the plasma and the Clearance-Rate once again showed sufficient values again on the 15th postoperative day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical trials with ADVATE in 145 children and adults 2 with a diagnosed serious to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 150 days), only one patient after 26 exposure days with ADVATE showed a low inhibitortiter (2.4 B.E. in modified Bethesda approach).</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, none of 53 paediatric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed with severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) were detected with a FVIII inhibitor after previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days).</seg>
<seg id="1562">In previously untreated patients with an ongoing clinical study 5 of 25 (20%) treated with ADVATE treated patients with factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The immune response of patients to traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by investigating the antibodies against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">One patient showed a statistically significant upward trend as well as an ongoing peak of the antibody level against anti-CHO cell protein, otherwise no signs or symptoms occurred that were indicative of an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">In four patients the incidence of urticaria, pruritus, skin rash and increased number of eosinophilic granulocytes were reported in several repeated product expositions within the study.</seg>
<seg id="1566">7 As with other intravenous products, ADVATE reports about hypersensitivity reactions of the allergic type, including anaphylactic / anaphylactoider reactions (frequency not known).</seg>
<seg id="1567">The activated Factor VIII acts as a Cofactor for the activated Factor IX and accelerates the formation of activated factor X from factor X.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, the CHMP has continued to evaluate the benefits risk assessment as positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP has decided on the basis of the security profile of ADVATE, which necessitates a filing of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited approved the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) officially that the company accepts its application for the marketing of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the chest, the brain, the bones or the soft parts (tissues that connect and support other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified to carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">"" "the virus in Advexin is an" "" "Adenovirus" "" "that has been altered in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans." ""</seg>
<seg id="1644">The Advexin would have been injected directly into the tumors, enabling cancer cells to re-form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced from the non-defective p53 gene is normally used to restore damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In the case of Li-Fraumeni cancer, in which the p53-gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient with Li-Fraumeni cancer in the underbelly area, in the bones and in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had examined the company's answers to the questions he asked, some questions were still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the examination of the initial submitted documents, the CHMP draws on a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP, it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Advexin in Li-Fraumeni-Tumore brings benefits to patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns about the treatment of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin can be manufactured in a reliable manner and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not inform CHMP about whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or "Compassionate-Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "changed drug release" "" "means that the tablets are composed so that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerobaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nose pathways caused by pollen) in patients with nasal mucous membrane swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and young people aged 12 and over, the recommended dose of Aerinaze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken with or without food with a glass of water.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and end once the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (blocked nose), are clad.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main impact was the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the commencement of treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients had their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">Considering all hay symptoms except constipation of the nose, the patients reported that the aerosaze increased by 46.0%, compared with 35.9% in patients who received pseudoephedrine on their own.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was considered, the patients under aeraaze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients who consumed Desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerobaze (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart chase), dizziness, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolence (somnolence), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerobaze may not be used in patients who are possibly hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, against the adrenergic active agents or Loratadin (another medicine for the treatment of allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerobaze may also not be used in patients who suffer from hypertension (hypertension), heart or vascular diseases including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hypertension) or a haemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted the Company SP Europe approval for the transport of Aerinaze across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water but can be swallowed whole (i.e. without breaking, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aeraaze should not be used in children under 12 years because of the lack of data on safety and efficacy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application should be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have ended.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the duration of application to 10 days, as long-term application can decrease the activity of pseudoephedrine with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After decreasing the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, treatment can be continued with desloratadin as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or within 2 weeks of the end of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is attributable to alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocriptin, pergolide, hydrochloric acid, cabergolin, dihydroergotamine or other deongestiva (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxygenazoline, nhazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient population and the data is not sufficient to provide appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Safety and efficacy of Aerinaze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is insufficient to pronounce appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that the treatment must be reduced in case of hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headache or strengthening of the headaches).</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in the anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder neck, or bronchospasm in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aeraaze is to be deposited at least 48 hours before performing dermatological tests, since antihistamines can otherwise prevent positive reactions on skin reactions or reduce them to their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the course of clinical trials with desloratadin, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole was additionally given, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychomotor test there were no significant differences between the patients treated with desloratadin and the placebo-treated patients regardless of whether or not it was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines can not be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin does not inhibit CYP3A4 in-vivo and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins is.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The safety of the use of aeraaze during pregnancy is not secured; experience gained from a large number of affected pregnancies has, however, no increase in the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">As reproduction studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of Pseudoephedrine, aeraaze should not be used during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to a dizziness, which may lead to impairment of traffic, or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyanose, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, difficult miction, muscle weakness, and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, respiratory failure, arrhythmias, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, transpiration, nausea, vomiting, presternal pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, blurred vision and hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">CNS stimulation is particularly probable in children, as well as atropin-typical symptoms (dry mouth, pupillary rigidity and - dilatation, redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as inhibiting the expression of the adhesion molecule P-Selector to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose trial with adults, Dloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance including amplification of subjective somnolence or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, the recommended dose of 5 mg. a day showed no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of Pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachycardia or manifestations of a CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 were involved with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving aerosaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, the histamine antagonistic activity of Aerinaze tablets was significantly higher on the basis of the overall score for the symptoms (except nasal mucous membrane swelling), significantly higher than under a pseudoephedrine monotherapy over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of aerobic tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined on the basis of nasal mucous membrane swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of aerobic tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnicity ethnicity.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study of the pharmacokinetics of aerobaze, desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes after administration in the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">Following the peroral application of aerobic with healthy volunteers for 14 days, the body weight of desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached in day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">Within the framework of a pharmacokinetic multi-dossier study carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects were poorly metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposure to Pseudoephedrine (Cmax and AUC) from Pseudoephedrine was bio-equivalent to exposure to an aerofaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">However, based on the conventional studies on safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated application, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with desloratadin do not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">In March 2007 and in Module 1.8.1 the pharmaceutical vigilance system described in the application for authorisation is established and works before and during the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to the relief of the allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's substance, its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerobaze tablets alleviate symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), such as sneezing, running or itchy nose and soothing or itchy eyes while constipation of the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1709">Inform your doctor if you encounter or diagnose the following symptoms or diseases when applying Aerinaze: • High blood pressure • heart chase, heart palpitations • heart rhythm disorders • nausea and headaches, or a strengthening of existing headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1710">If you are taking Aerinaze with other medicines please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Airtightness and the use of machines In the recommended dosage, it is not to be expected that aerobatics will lead to dizziness or reduce the attention.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the launch of desloratadin very rarely has been reported in cases of severe allergic reactions (breath, whistling breathing, itching, hives and swelling) or skin rashes.</seg>
<seg id="1718">About cases of palpitations, heart chase, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, dizziness, sleep disorders, muscle pain, seizures, restlessness with increased physical activity, about cases of inflammation of the liver and about cases of conspicuous liver values was also very rarely reported.</seg>

<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four trials of seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies of patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The efficacy was measured by changing the symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadruped, impairment of sleep and performance in the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been submitted to prove that the body analyzes the syrup, the solution to intake and the tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius resulted in an average decrease of the symptom scores (symptom score) of 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In both cases of urticaria, the number of symptoms after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67%, compared to 40 and 33%, was compared to those treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, lauatadin or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the transport of Aerius throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with or without a meal, for alleviating the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical trials on efficacy in the use of desloratadin in adolescents aged 12 to 17 (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be carried out according to the previous disease procedure and can be terminated after the symptoms have been delayed and re-recorded in their reoccurring.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In case of persistent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks) the patient can be recommended during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with desloratadin tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally given (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, the performance of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to dizziness, which may lead to impairment of airtightness or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more side effects were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily in patients with Aerius than in patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo were tiredness (1.2%), dry mouth (0.8%) and headaches (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">A clinical study involving 578 adolescents aged 12 to 17 was the most common side effect of headaches, which occurred in 5.9% of patients treated with desloratadin and at 6.9% of patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose trial, in which up to 45 mg of loretadin (nine-fold clinical dose) were administered.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as inhibiting the expression of the adhesion molecule P-Selector to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">In a clinical study with multiple doses, in which desloratadin was administered in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study, in which desloratadin was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily (which nine times the clinical dose) was administered over ten days, there was no longer an extension of the Qtc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dosis- study involving adults, Dloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance including amplification of subjective somnolence or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal flow and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonally and perennial, allergic rhinitis can alternatively be divided into allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis, depending on the duration of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis are defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persisting allergic rhinitis are defined as the occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown on the overall score of the questionnaires for quality of life at Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Chronic idiopathic urticaria was investigated for further forms of urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology, irrespective of etiology, is similar in the different forms and can be recruited prospectively chronic patients.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since histamine release is a causal factor for all urticarial diseases, it is expected that in other forms of urticaria, desloratadin will also lead to an improvement in symptoms in other forms of urticaria; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and reducing the size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistaminic in chronically idiopathic urticaria the minority of patients who did not react to antihistamines was excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement of the itching rate by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with desloratadin compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and wakefulness, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, in which patient demos were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of patients achieved a higher concentration of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications of clinically relevant accumulation after once daily use of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely ruled out</seg>
<seg id="1758">In vivo, desloratadin inhibits CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that CYP2D6 does not inhibit CYP2D6 and is neither a substrate nor inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dosisstudy with desloratadin in a dose of 7.5 mg meals (fatty, calorie rich breakfast) did not affect the availability of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The preclinical studies carried out with desloratadin and Loratadin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxicity profiles of loratadin and Loratadin.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of meals, for alleviating the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing physician should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years of age are caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and that there are no data that support a treatment of infectious rhinitis with amerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomical anomalies, anamnesis, physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin tests should also play a role in the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of age metabolize Desloratadin and experience a higher substance load (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children between 2 and 11 years that are fully metabolized is identical to those with children who are normal metabolizing.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore patients should not take this medicine with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose absorption or sucase isomaltase- insufficiency of this medicine.</seg>

<seg id="1770">In a clinical pharmacological study, the performance of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius tablets and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall incidence of adverse events in children from 2 to 11 years was similar to the Aerius syrup group as in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more side effects were reported in patients with Aerius than in patients who were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study involving adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of loretadin (nine times a clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children between 1 and 11 years of age who were eligible for anti-histamine therapy received a daily mean dose of 1.25 mg (aged between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronically idiopathic urticaria and the profile of desloratadin in adults and children are similar, the efficacy data of desloratadin in adults can be extrapolated to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">In a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents, in which desloratadin was applied in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical pharmacological study of adults and adolescents, in the desloratadin in a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine times the clinical dose) was applied for ten days in adults, there was no longer an extension of the Qtc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical studies, at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents, no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1779">At a single daily dose of 7.5 mg Aerius tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials did not cause any impairment of psychomotor activity.</seg>
<seg id="1780">In clinical pharmacological studies in adults, the simultaneous intake of alcohol prevented neither an increase in alcohol-induced performance injury nor an increase in drowsiness.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in relieving symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal flow and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As shown on the overall score of the questionnaires for quality of life at Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius tablets will effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and reducing the size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The spread of this limited-metabolic phenotype was comparable to adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6%) and in both populations larger at blacks (18% adults, 16% children) than with Caucasians (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study involving the syrup formulation of children aged 2-11 with allergic rhinitis, which are fully metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1786">The load (AUC) by desloratadin was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the Cmax about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half-life of approximately 120 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1787">There are no indications for a clinically relevant drug-accumulation after a daily use of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) for 14 days in adults and adolescents.</seg>
<seg id="1788">12 In various single dose studies, the AUC and Cmax values of desloratadin in paediatric patients were comparable to those of adults who received desloratadin syrup in a dosage of 5 mg.</seg>

<seg id="1893">June 2008, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. informed the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) that the company has withdrawn its application for the marketing of Aflunov for the prevention of aviaries H5N1 influenza in adults and older people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influenza caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears, which can easily spread from man to person, because people do not yet have immunity (no protection) on the other hand.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system recognises the parts of the flu virus in the vaccine as "foreign-foreign" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system is able to make antibodies faster in contact with a flu virus of this tribe.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane cover of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface which detects the human body as foreign) was purified and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">An inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">The scope of the clinical data basis for assessing the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for pre-pandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">If you are participating in a clinical trial and need further information about your treatment, please contact your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">For further information on the basis of CHMP's recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines to treat adults and children over four years that are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, asgenase is available as a solution for intake, but this cannot be taken together with ritonavir as the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenerase should only be prescribed when the doctor has checked which antiviral medicines the patient has taken before, and the likelihood of the virus to respond to the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of ritonavir and other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between 4 and 12 years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenase is based on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">In combination with other antiviral medicines, Agenerel reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Not to cure AIDS, however, can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">It was compared with other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who used protease inhibitors in 206 adults who used a low dose kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the viral load change after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously had no protease inhibitors, after 48 weeks under asgenase, more patients had a viral load below 400 copies / ml than placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also reduced the viral load, but only very few of the children were treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who formerly had been treated with protease inhibitors the drug Agenerase increased the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, it came under asgenase along with Ritonavir for a stronger drop in the viral load after four weeks as with the patients who continued their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common Agenase (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhea), nausea, vomiting, skin rash and fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amponavir or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerasis may also not be used in patients, St. John's Wort (an herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or medicines that are decomposed in the same way as Agenase and in high concentrations in the blood are harmful to health.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, there is a risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteoarthritis (death of bone tissue) or an immune activation syndroms (symptoms of infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Agenase in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years were outweighed against the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the Committee stated that the benefit of Agenase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who had previously taken no protease inhibitors is not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally licensed under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "since only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Glaxo Group Limited for the launching of Agenase in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitors (PI) -treated adults and children aged 4 and over.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually aspiration capsules for pharmacokinetic boosters of ampprenavir should be administered together with low doses of ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of ampprenavir should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and pretreatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amprenavir as a solution to intake is 14% lower than of ampprenavir as a capsule; therefore, Agenerel capsules and solution for taking on one milligram per milligram are not exchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenase capsules is 600 mg of amponavir twice daily, along with 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerel capsules are used without the intensifying addition of ritonavir (boosting), higher doses of agitase (1200 mg twice daily) need to be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of ampprenavir / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral drugs to a daily dose of 2400 mg of ampprenavir that should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of asgenase in combination with low doses of kritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not studied in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerasis is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to lack of data on safety and efficacy (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Concurrent use should be treated with care in patients with mild or moderate liver function disorder, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerasis may not be used simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also mediate the mediums of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzymes 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of ampprenavir while taking ampprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Agenerel or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The present antiretroviral therapy including treatment with Agenerasis does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually, Ageneric drugs should be used together with low doses of ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious liver damage with potentially lethal outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant specialist information of these medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing reduced liver function including chronic-active hepatitis show increased incidence of liver dysfunction under antiretroviral therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of Agenase and Ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids, which are metabolized via CYP3A4, is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects including morbus Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">As the metabolism of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of Agenase with Lovastatin and simvastatin is not recommended due to the increased risk of myopathies including rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under the supervision of the International Regular Ratio), methods are available to determine the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients taking this medicine at the same time, Agenerasis may be less effective due to the reduced plasma levels of Amprenavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Because of the possibility of metabolic interactions with ampprenavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives can be altered, however, the information is insufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with ampprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored for opium withdrawal symptoms, especially if low doses of kritonavir can be administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the potential risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycol content of the Agenerel solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under the age of four and should be used with caution on certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be terminated in the duration of 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients receiving antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases that were necessary for therapy to be associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and with drug-dependent factors, such as a longer lasting antiretroviral treatment and related metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In the case of hemmophilic patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, reports of an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and haemarthrosis occur.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can develop at the time of initiating an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART), leading to serious clinical conditions or worsening symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial aetiology is believed (including use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, heavy immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteoarthritis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term use of antiretroviral therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrate with low therapeutic width Agenerase may not be used simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also mediate the mediums of the P450-Isosyndrome 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with a low therapeutic width Agenerase with kritonavir may not be combined with drugs whose active ingredients are metabolized mainly via CYP2D6 and are associated with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in AUC by Amprenavir, which can lead to virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to balance the reduced plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with ritonavir, very often adverse effects on the liver were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of Amprenavir can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient has already used St. John's wort, the blood pressure levels are and, if possible, to check the viral load and to suspend the St. John's Wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">Dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not required when nelfinavir is administered together with Amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">50% increased, for Cmax, by contrast, by 30% when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) in combination with ampprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily) was administered.</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, dosages of 600 mg of amponavir were used twice a day and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment regimen.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% abducted when ampprenavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of kritonavir twice a day).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Amprenavir in plasma that have been reached in the combination of ampprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg of kritonavir twice a day) are given twice daily in combination with 100 mg of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of ampprenavir and caletra cannot be given, however, a close monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">No pharmacokinetic study was performed to use Agenase in combination with Didanosin, but due to Didanosin's imaginative component it is recommended that the revenues of Didanosin and Agenerase are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with ampprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), dose adaptation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with favirenz in combination with ampprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as exposure of both protease inhibitors would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effects of nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and available limited data suggest that nevirapin may reduce the serum concentration of ampprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">Be careful if these medicines should be used at the same time because Delavirdin could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">Caution is required if these medicines are used together; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be carried out, as an exact prediction of the effect of the combination of amponavir and ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of ampprenavir and rifabutin led to an increase in plasma concentrations (AUC) of rifabutin by 193%, resulting in a rise in the side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with Agenerase, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin will be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose, although there are no clinical data.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with asgenase in combination with erythromycin were not performed, but the plasma levels of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of Foscarrenavir and 100 mg of ketoconazole once a day led to an increase of the Cmax of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) to the value, which was observed after 200 mg of ketoconazole once a day without concurrent application of fossils avir with ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, may possibly result in interactions with Agenerasis.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions that are associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with asgenase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitors it is advisable that antacids should not be taken at the same time as asgenase since it can lead to resorption disturbances.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anti-convulsives, known as enzyme-inductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of ampprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipin, Diltiazem, Felodipine, Israelipin, Nicardipin, nifedipine, nimodipine, nistridipin and verapamil can be increased 10 by amponavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of these medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Concurrent consumption with Agenerase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and strengthen associated side effects with PDE5 inhibitors, including hypotension, visual disturbances and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of subjects, the fluoroasonpropionate plasma levels rose significantly, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous addition of Agenase with Ritonavir along with these glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">In HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, pronounced increases in plasma levels are expected at the same time administration of Agenerasis.</seg>
<seg id="1990">As plasma-level increases in these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors lead to myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, the combined application of these pharmaceuticals is not recommended with ampprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1991">Frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabilization of the mirrors is recommended, as the plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased while simultaneously offering ampprenavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore Agenerase should not be used together with oral midazolam (see section 4.3), while concurrent use of Agenase with parenteral Midazolam is advisable.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for the simultaneous use of parenteral Midazolam with other proteinase inhibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasma levels of Midazolam by 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with ampprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored for opium withdrawal symptoms, especially if low doses of kritonavir can be administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the low reliability of historical comparisons, there is currently no recommendation to be given how to adapt the ampprenavir dose if Amprenavir is administered with methadone at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With concurrent administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agenase an increased control of the INR (International Regular Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, therefore also alternative methods for contraception are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example desipramine and nortryptilin) is recommended with concurrent administration of Agenerasis (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this drug may only be used after careful weighing of the potential benefits for the mother compared to possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk of lactation rats, ampprenavir-related substances have been detected, but it is not known whether ampprenavir is transferred to breast milk in people.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, which was administered from the nistination into the uterus until the end of the lactation period of ampprenavir, showed a diminished increase of 12 body weight during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of offspring, including fertility and reproductive capacity, was not affected by the administration of ampprenavir to the mother animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Agenerase's safety was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most adverse events associated with Agenase treatment were mild to moderate, early on and rarely used for treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events have not been clarified whether they are related to taking Agenerase or another medicine used to treat HIV, or whether they are a consequence of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects listed below stem from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients with protease inhibitors received 1200 mg Agenerase twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), which were evaluated by the investigators as in connection with the study medication and appeared in more than 1% of the patients, as well as in the treatment occurring laboratory changes (degree 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including loss of peripheral and fatheral subcutaneous fat tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophy of breasts and thoracic fat accumulation (stitches).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Among 113 antiretroviral-treated individuals who had been treated with amponavir in combination with Lamivuddin / Zidovuddin for a mean duration of 36 weeks, only one case (stitches) (&lt; 1%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the PROAB 3006 study, 245 NRTI- treated patients under Amprenavir 7 cases (3%) showed up to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients with indinavir, in combination with various NRTIs for a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Rashes were usually mild to moderately pronounced, erythematous or macroporous nature, with or without itching and occurred normally during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment having to be stopped with ampprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteoarthritis were reported in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term use of antiretroviral therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can develop at the time of initiating an antiretroviral combination therapy (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">In patients receiving 600mg Agenerase twice daily with low dosed ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), the type and frequency of adverse events (Grade 3 and 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4) were observed very frequently in patients who received aspiration together with low dosed ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of an overdose, the patient is to observe signs of intoxiation (see section 4.8) if necessary, to initiate necessary supportive measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active centre of the HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the process of viral Gag- and gag-pol- polyprotein precursors with the result of a formation of non-infectious, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">Antiviral activity of ampprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied both in acute and chronic lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of Amprenavir lies in the range of 0,012 to 0,08 µM in acute infected cells and is 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of HIV-1 in vitro and inhibiting HIV-1 replication in humans has not yet been defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral unpretreated patients with currently approved fossils / kritonavir-dosages - as with other ritonavir-based treatment regimens with protease inhibitors - the described mutations were rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretroviral-treated patients who received 700mg of fossils per 100mg of kritonavir twice daily in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure occurred up to week 48, with 14 isolates being genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypic analysis of 13 out of 14 children, in which a virological failure occurred within the 59 patients who were not treated with protease inhibitors, showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, I47V, G48V, I62V, I54L / M / T / V, I47V, D60E, I62A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its extension APV30005 (700 mg of fossils per 100 mg of kritonavir twice a day: n = 107) in patients treated with protease inhibitors occurred over 96 weeks in patients with the following protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypic resistance tests based on genotypic resistance testing can be used to estimate the activity of amponavir / ritonavir or fossils avir / kritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS AC-11 algorithm for Foscarrenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of the mutations V32I + 147a / V, or I50V, or at least 4 of the following mutations L10F / I, L33F, V82A / C / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / G, I84V and L90M.</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns can be subject to changes due to additional data, and it is recommended to always approach current interpretation systems to analyse the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Based on phenotypic resistance tests clinically validated phenotypic interpretation systems can be used in combination with genotypic data to estimate the activity of ampprenavir / ritonavir or fossils avir / ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically-phenotypic cut-offs (separators) for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four genetic samples associated with reduced sensitivity to amponavir produces a certain cross-resistance to ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains however generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on the cross-resistance between ampprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fossileshavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral-treated patients, in whom a fossils-containing formula failed (one of which showed resistance against Lopinavir and saquinavir (one of 25 isolates), indinavir / Ritonavir (three out of 24 isolates), saquinavir (three out of 24 isolates) and Tipranavir / ritonavir (four out of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Vice versa, Amprenavir maintains its activity against some other protease inhibitor-resistant isolates; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Premature termination of a preventive therapy is recommended in order to limit the accumulation of a variety of mutations, which can adversely affect the subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The efficacy of Agenase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open study, in which with PI pretreated adults following virological failure (100 mg twice daily) and nucleoside aloga (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with low-dose Ritonavir. "</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-three (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the partial study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis showed the non-inferiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group in the viral load (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-loss threshold of 0.4 lo10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The efficacy of unbiased agitasis is based on two uncontrolled studies with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of whom 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, aspiration solution for intake and capsules in dosages of 15 mg / kg was examined three times a day, 20 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with Agenase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of the patients enrolled in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml with a median increase in CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "19 Based on this data, the anticipated benefits of" "" "unbiased" "" "aspiration should be considered in the therapy optimisation of children treated with PI." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral dosing, the average duration (Tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of ampprenavir is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">Raised 508%, by contrast, by 30% for Cmax while Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with ampprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of ampprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease of the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of ampprenavir 12 hours after dosing (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the steady state (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by food intake, although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l (6 l / kg for a body weight of 70 kg) and allows a large distribution volume as well as an unobstructed penetration of ampprenavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active ingredient in the plasma, whereby the amount of unbound ammunition, which represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>

<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, leads to a similar daily secretion of amponavir as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Ambuavir is out of the solution 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules; therefore, asgenase solution and agitase capsules are not replaceable on a milligram-basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">The renal clearance of kritonavir is also negligible, therefore the effect of renal dysfunction should be low on the elimination of amponavir and ritonavir.</seg>

<seg id="2061">Studies on the toxicity of young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with amponavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In systemic plasma exposure, which was significantly lower (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than the expected exposure to therapeutic dosages in humans, however, a number of minor changes including thyme and minor skeletal changes were observed that indicate a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenerel capsules are used without the intensifying addition of ritonavir (boosting), higher doses of agitase (1200 mg twice daily) need to be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of ampprenavir / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral drugs to a daily dose of 2400 mg of ampprenavir that should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>

<seg id="2076">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipin, Diltiazem, Felodipine, Israelipin, Nicardipin, nifedipine, nimodipine, nistridipin and verapamil can be increased by ampoupin, thus increasing the activity and toxicity of these medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2077">In a clinical study, in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of subjects, the fluoroasonpropionate plasma levels rose significantly, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">With concurrent administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agenase an increased control of the INR (International Regular Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">The simultaneous administration of Ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0,035 mg of ethinylestradiol plus 1.0 mg of Norethindron) resulted in a decrease of the AUC and Cmin of ampprenavir by 22% respectively.</seg>

<seg id="2203">There are only very limited data on the application of imiquimine for the treatment of actin keratoses in anatomical places outside the face and the scalp.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The available data on the actinic keratose on the forearms and hands do not support the efficacy in this application, therefore such an application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions occur frequently, but these reactions usually decrease in intensity in the course of therapy or go back after the treatment with Imiquimod cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local skin reactions cause great discomfort to the patient or are very strong, the treatment may be exposed for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Data from an open clinical study showed that patients with more than 8 accesions showed a lower total healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to immune-stimulating properties, imiquimine cream should be used with care in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">Animal studies show no direct or indirect effects on the pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although quantifiable serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) were achieved neither after one-off or after a multiple topical application, no recommendation can be given to the application during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most commonly reported and likely or possibly associated with the application of Imiquimod cream related adverse events in trials with three weeks of treatment were local reactions in the location of treatment of the case warts (33.7% of patients treated with Imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2212">The most common reported and probably or possibly associated with the application of the Imiquimeo-cream related side-effects include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">The basalioma patients treated by 185 with Imiquimod cream from a placebo-controlled clinical study of phase III reported side effects are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common, probably or possibly with the application of imiquimine-cream related side effects were in these studies a reaction to the application site (22% of patients treated with Imiquimide).</seg>
<seg id="2215">Adverse events indicated by 252 in placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trials with Imiquimod cream are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">This assessment of the clinical signs provided according to the test plan shows that in these placebo-controlled clinical studies, with three times weekly treatment with Imiquimod cream, it often came to local skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), excoriation / leaves (23%) and edema (14%) (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">According to the study schedule, this evaluation of clinical signs shows that in these studies, with five times weekly treatment with Imiquimod cream, it is very common to severe erythema (31%), heavy erosions (13%), and severe shoorage and calcification (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical trials investigating the use of imiquimine for the treatment of actin keratose, alopecia was observed with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The inadvertent oral intake of 200 mg of imiquimine, which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headaches, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically most severe side effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, was in hypotonia which normalized after oral or intravenous fluids.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic investigation, systemic concentrations of alpha-interferon and other cytokines were detected after topical application of Imiquimine.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal phase 3 efficacy studies, efficacy was significantly superior in an Imiquimodine treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2223">In 60% of the total of 119 patients treated with Imiquimod, the patients were completely healed; this was the case at 20% of the 105 patients treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing could be achieved in 23% of 157 patients treated with Imiquimod, compared to 5% of 161 with placebo-treated male patients (95% CI:</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of imiquimine in five times application per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed individual primary superficial basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">Data from an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years show that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%) of all treated patients were clinically healed and that remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The efficacy of imiquimine at three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week, treatment-free period, was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non hypertrophic, non hypertrophic accesions within a contiguous 25 cm2 treatment area on the hairy scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The one-year data from two combined observation studies indicate a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications are external fungal warts, actin keratose and superficial basal cell carcinoma usually do not appear in paediatric patients and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara cream was examined in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of imiquimine could not be shown in these studies in the dosages examined there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively)</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic image of the 5% Imiquimodine cream through the skin of 58 patients with actin keratose was observed in the three-week weekly application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest drug concentrations in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and were 0.1, 0,2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the application in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable pouch), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated half-life time was about 10 times higher than the 2-hour half-life after the subcutaneous use in a previous study; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Systemic exposure data showed that the resorption of imiquimine after topical application of patients between 6-12 years was low and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with actin keratose or superficial basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study of dermal toxicity in rats, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg lead to significantly reduced body weight and increased spleen weight; a study of dermal application conducted for four months showed no similar effects with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice during the three days a week did not induce tumours in the application area.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutated, there is a risk for man due to systemic exposure to be considered very low.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors occurred in the group of mice treated with the carbon-free cream earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (symptoms that are not associated with brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not degraded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints that make movements difficult, reduced lung volume, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should take place in a hospital or clinic with revitalizing devices, and patients may need appropriate medicines to prevent an allergic reaction before the administration.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study mainly investigates the safety of the drug, but its effectiveness was also measured (by examining the effect in relation to the reduction of GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years Aldurazyme lowered the GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat sensation, fever and reactions at the infusion point.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Frequent side effects in patients under five years of age are elevated blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation (a measuring size of the lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may react strongly hypersensitive to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">Every year, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review all new information that may be known, and where necessary update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will observe patients receiving alurazyms with regard to the reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted the company Genzyme Europe B.V. a permit for the launching of Aldurazyme throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammal cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, egg stock of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme therapy in patients with a secure diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 e / kg / h can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes in single steps.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of duracyms in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined, and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions that are defined as any side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only take place in an appropriate clinical setting where revitalizing facilities for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">As a result of the clinical phase 3 study, nearly all patients with IgG antibodies against Laronidase are expected to form, usually within 3 months from the start of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution when using Aldurazyme (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since there is little experience in resuming the treatment after a longer break, the risk of hypersensitivity after an interruption of the treatment has to be cautiously avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the beginning of infusion with medications (antihistamines and / or antipyreagents) to treat the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of mild or moderate infusion-related reaction, the treatment should be considered with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or reduce the infusion rate to half the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, severe infusion-related reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) and a reduction of infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous response occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquine or procaine because there is a potential risk of interfering with intracellular intake of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not cause direct or indirect effects on the pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there are no data on newborns exposed to Laronidase via the mother's milk, it is recommended not to breastfeed during the treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as infusion-related reactions, which were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (duration of treatment up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (duration of treatment up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions in connection with Aldurazyme, which were observed during the Phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or over, are listed in the following table according to the following frequency: very common (≥ 1 / 10); commonly (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the prehistory, severe reactions emerged, including bronchospasm, respiration and facial oils (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted drug effects associated with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study involving a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years, with predominantly severe delay form and a duration of treatment up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Most patients received a Seroconversion within 3 months of the beginning of the treatment, most of the patients with a more severe form of follow-up within a month (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the Phase 3 study (or until a premature departure from the study) no investigational antibodies (RIP) assay were present in 13 / 45 patients, including 3 patients with whom it had never been too late.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with low or low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the GAG mirror in the urine, whereas a variable reduction of GAG in the urine was determined in patients with high antibody titres.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal to small neutralizing inhibiting effect on enzymatic laronidase activity in vitro, which did not impair the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not seem to be associated with the incidence of unwanted drug reactions although the incidence of undesirable drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for enzyme therapy is one of the hydrolysis of the accumulating medium and the prevention of further accumulation of adequate enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After IV infusion, Laronidase is quickly removed from the blood circulation and absorbed by cells into the lysosomes, most likely using mannose-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of duracyms were examined in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study involving 45 patients aged 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, which showed the entire spectrum of the disease, the majority of patients had an average phenotype and only one patient showed the heavy phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FeV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FeV and the total distance in the 6-minute ear test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were then recruited for an open label extension study, where they received 100 E / kg of Aldurazyme each week for 3.5 years (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with Aldurazyme showed an improvement in lung function and salaries presented in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FeV is not clinically significant over this period and the total pulmonary volume increased further proportionately to the size of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a Hepatomegaly before treatment 22 (85%) reached normal liver size up to the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a significant drop in the GAG mirror in the urine (µg / mg creatinine) was established, which remained constant to the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In terms of the heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patients, which was taken into account by using a combined end point, clinically significant changes across five efficacy variables (expected percentage of normal shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), there was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were examined in 20 patients who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion in the study (16 patients with severe course form and 4 with mean follow-up form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage due to increased Gag- mirror in the urine in week 22 was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) were determined according to the Z-Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe course form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form showed normal mental development speed whereas in the older patients with severe delay-form only limited or no progress was observed in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, investigations on pharmacodynamic effects of various duracyms dosing regimens were performed on the GAG mirror in the urine, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent a justifiable alternative for patients with difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosing regimens is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate every new information available annually, and if necessary, the description of the medicinal properties will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Pharmacokinetic profile in patients under 5 years of age was similar to that of elderly and less severely affected patients.</seg>

<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with cisplatin (another drug against cancer) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy (medicine against cancer) and "maligne" (malignant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body or spreads easily to other parts of the body). • advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer that does not attack the squamous cell cells.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is used in patients who have not been treated before, in combination with cisplatin and in patients who previously received other chemotherapies than any therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2356">In order to reduce side effects, patients should intake a corticosteroid and folic acid (a vitamin) during treatment with Alimta and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered with cisplatin together with cisplatin, an additional "antiemetics" (remedy against vomiting) and liquids (to prevent liquid deficiency) should be given before or after the application of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood flow changes or in which certain other side effects occur, treatment should be delayed, discontinued or the dose is reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of telemetreins therefore slows down the formation of the DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from dividing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of telemetric to its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer term of action in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant pleural therapy, Alimta was examined in a major study of 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared to the effects of docetaxel (another drug against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared to gemcitabine (another anti-cancer drug), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1,725 patients who previously had no chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin had an average of 12.1 months compared to 9.3 months for the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time with Alimta was 8.3 months, compared with 7.9 months in docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">However, in both studies, patients with whom the cancer did not attack the squamous cell cells showed longer survival times when administration of Alimta than with the comparative investigational medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. a permit for the launch of Alimta in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), resulting in a resolution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary do- sis is taken from the piercing bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see Section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is indicated in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, except for overlying plate epithelial histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for the treatment in second-line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, except for overlying plate epithelial histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² body surface (KOF) is administered intravenously intravenously over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as an infusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after the completion of the Sheremetrexed- infusion on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small-cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is given as an intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">In order to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid must be given on the day before and on the day of the telemetric administration as well as on the day after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days prior to the first dose of Sheremetrexed, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued during the whole therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last Sheremetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients also have to receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) in the week before the first pemetric dose as well as after every third operation cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients who receive Sheremetrexed, a complete hemorrhage should be created before each administration, including a differentiation of the leukocytes and a platelet count.</seg>
<seg id="2379">The alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine-transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose test must take place in consideration of the Nadir of the blood balance or the maximum non-haematological toxicity of the previous therapy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After the recovery, patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are applied to ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC Grade 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients develop non-haematological toxicity ≥ Grade 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy with ALIMTA must be interrupted until the patient has the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">The treatment with ALIMTA must be stopped if a haematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity grade 3 or 4 occurs or so- at the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical trials showed no evidence that patients aged 65 years of age or over 65 years of age have an increased risk of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, no dose adjustment was necessary in patients with a creatinine clearance ≥ 45 ml / min, which surpass the dose adjustment recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data layer in patients with a creatinine clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 fold of the upper limit value and / or transaminase values from &gt; the 3.0-fold of the upper limit value (in the presence of liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0 times of the upper limit value (in the presence of liver metastases) were not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be supervised with regard to bone marital immunosuppression and telemetrexed may not be administered to patients before their absolute neutrophils count again a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the platelet cyte has a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrophils, platelet number and maximum non-haematological toxicity observed in previous cycles (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of Grade 3 / 4 haematological and non-human haematological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neutropenia were observed when pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with telemetrexed have to be instructed to use folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure to reduce the toxicity of treated toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium renal insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid the simultaneous use of nonsteroidal antiphlogistics (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and acetylsali- cyllic acid (&gt; 1.3 g daily) for at least 2 days after therapy with telemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients who undergo therapy with telemetrexed have to avoid taking NSAIDs with a long half-life for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with telemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients where these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing hypertension or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, a drainage of the effluent before the plasma-mixed treatment should be considered in patients with clinically significant fluid buildup in the transdercellular space.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 severe cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were reported in clinical trials with telemetrexed occasionally when administered in combination with another cytotoxic agent.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous application of attenuated live vaccine (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of an irreversible injury of the reproductive capacity is mixed by telemetry, men should be advised in front of the treatment centre in order to obtain advice regarding the preservation of the sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal renal function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of nonsteroidal antiphlogistics (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high dosages (≥ 1.3 g. a day) lead to a reduction in telemetric discharge with the result of increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore, caution is required when treating high doses of NSAIDs or ace- tylsalicylic acid in high doses in patients with normal renal function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen or acetylsalicylic acid in high doses to be avoided for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with telemetrexed (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since no data concerning the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-life such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib is available, the simultaneous application with telemetrexed has to be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy, at least 2 days after therapy with telemetre- xed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the INR (International Regular Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of telemetrexed in pregnant women, but as with antimetabolites, severe birth defects are expected in the case of an application during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Telemetrexed may not be used during pregnancy except if strictly required and after careful weighing of benefits for the mother and the risk of fetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of irreversibly deterioration of the reproductive capacity by telemetry, men should be advised before the start of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the blocking of the sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether telemetric mixed in breast milk and unwanted effects in the breastfed infant cannot be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma and the randomised cisplatin and pemetremixed - as well as 163 patients with mesothelioma who were randomized to receive cisplatin as monotherapy.</seg>

<seg id="2430">Cases of radiation pneumonitis were reported in patients who were beamed before, during or after their telemetric therapy (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Sheremetrexed) is a antineoplastic anti-folate, which exerts its effect by interrupting important metabolic processes necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that telemetry operates as an antifolate with several attack points by blocking the thymidylatynthase (TS), Dihydrofolate reductase (GARFT), the folate-dependent key enzymes of the de novo Biosynthesis of thymidin and Purinnucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicentre, randomised, simple-blind, Phase 3 study of ALIMTA plus cisplatin versus cisplatin, showed that patients treated with ALIMTA and Cisplatin had a clinically meaningful benefit to survival compared to those patients who were only curled with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The primary analysis of this study was conducted in the population of all patients who received the test medication in the arm (randomised and treated).</seg>
<seg id="2435">A statistically significant improvement of the clinically relevant symptoms (pain and dyspnoea) in connection with the malignant pleural retinal othelioma was shown in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm (212 patients) compared with the sole Cisplatin arm (218 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2436">The differences between the two treatment arms were affected by an improvement of the pulmonary function parameters in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm and a decrease in lung function over time in the control arm.</seg>
<seg id="2437">A multicentre, randomised, open phase III study with ALIMTA against docetaxel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after previous chemotherapy achieved median survival of patients treated with ALIMTA (Intent to treat population n = 283) and 7.9 months with patients treated with docetaxel (ITT n = 288).</seg>
<seg id="2438">An analysis of the influence of histology on the treatment effect on overall survival was found in favor of ALIMTA in patients with NSCLC with a predominantly non-plate epithelial histological type (n = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.61-1.00, p = 0,047), adjusted HR = 1.56; 95% CI = 1,08-2,26, p = 0.018).</seg>
<seg id="2439">Limited data from a separately randomised, controlled phase 3 study showed that efficacy data (survival and progression-free survival) for telemetry between patients with (n = 41) and without (n = 540) pretreatment by docetaxel are similar.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The efficacy analyses of the PQ population are consistent with the analysis of the ITT population and support the non-inferiority of the ALIMTA Cisplatin combination compared to gemcitabine Cisplatin combination.</seg>

<seg id="2507">In the two studies on patients with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients who took Alli 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg after one year, compared with 2.3 kg when taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">In the study with alli in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2, no relevant weight loss could be observed for patients.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of Alli (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are oily spots on after, flatus (winds) with stage duct, stucco thread, oily / oily chair, finish oily secretion (decay), flatulence (winds) and soft chairs.</seg>

<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for reducing the weight of adults with overweight (BMI body mass index ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in combination with a slightly hypocaloric, low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli may not be used by children and adolescents under 18, since there is not enough data on efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">Since orlistat is only minimally absorbed, it is not necessary to adjust the dosage for older people and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="2516">• Simultaneous treatment with Ciclosporin (see section 4.5) • Chronic malabsorption syndrome • Cholestasis • pregnancy (see section 4.6) • Premature treatment with Warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see sections 4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The probability of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) can increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich single-meal or a rich diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">As weight reduction in diabetes is associated with improved metabolic control, patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting a therapy with alli, because the dose of antidiabetics should be adapted if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients taking alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage of these medicines has to be adapted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional pregnancy-prevention measures in order to prevent possible failure of oral contraception in case of severe diarrhoea (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">In a study on interactions of drugs as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of orlistat and Ciclosporin, a reduction of Ciclosporin plasma levels was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">In the application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick-Values (International Regular ratio, INR) could be affected (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">Most patients who were treated with orlistat in clinical trials up to 4 full years remained the levels of vitamins A, D, E and K as well as the beta carotine in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be advised to take a supplementary multivitamin supplement before bedtime to ensure sufficient vitamin intake (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the application of a single dose of Amiodarone, a marginal decrease of the Amiodarone plasma concentration was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic and fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are related to the pharmacological effect of the drug, as the absorption of biased fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) and very rare (≥ 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on available data is not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The frequency of adverse events reported after the market launch of orlistat is unknown, as these events were volunteered by a population of some magnitude.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that the treatment with alli can lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg of orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight subjects without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of cases reported after the market launch of orlistat overdosing, either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on research on humans and animals, a quick recovery of any systemic effects caused by the inhibitory properties of orlistat can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">In the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine the therapeutic effect is due to covalent bonding to the active serum-rest of the gastric and pankreatic lifts.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Clinical trials have shown that 60 mg of orlistat, taken three times a day, blocks the absorption of about 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 show the efficacy of 60 mg of orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypocaloric, fat-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of randomization), was evaluated as follows: as a change in the body weight in the course of study (table 1) and as a percentage of those participating in study, who lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average dietary change in the Gesamtcholesterin amounted to 60 mg -2.4% (initial value 5,20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (initial value 5,26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average dietary change in LDL cholesterol was 60 mg -3.5% (baseline: 3.30 mmol / l) and placebo + 3.8% (initial value of 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">The mean change in waist circumference was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting value 103.7 cm) and placebo -3,6 cm (baseline: 103,5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, non-metabolized orlistat in plasma could only be detected sporadically and at extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without signs of cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">Two main metabolites, i.e. M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed lactearring) and M3 (M1, after splitting the N-shape leucine group), were identified in a study with obese patients, which showed nearly 42% of the total plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2546">Based on the conventional studies of safety macology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data does not show any particular danger to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2587">The most common side effects are related to the mode of action of the capsules and result in more fat being excreted from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2588">These side effects usually occur within the first weeks of the treatment, as you may not have consistently reduced the fat percentage in your diet.</seg>
<seg id="2589">With the following basic rules, you can learn to minimize the diet-related side effects: • Begin already a few days, or better a week, before the first intake of the capsules with a fat-dusty diet. • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of the portions that you normally consume.</seg>
<seg id="2590">If you know exactly how much you eat, the likelihood of exceeding your fat limit decreases. • Distribute your recommended amount of fat evenly on your daily meals.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Alois is used in chemotherapies, which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin), as well as in chemotherapies, the moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The efficacy of Alois can be increased by adding a corticosteroids (a drug that can be used as an antiemetics).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as there is not enough information on the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient inhibits the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">In three main studies, Alois was examined in 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy, which are severe or moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with Alois showed no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 of 223), versus 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 out of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, which are moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients treated with Alois showed no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 of 189), versus 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 from 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with dolasetron these values were 63% for Alois (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for dolasetron (101 out of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted the company Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. approval for the launch of Alois in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Alois is indicated: to prevent acute nausea and vomiting in highly emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Alois to prevent nausea and vomiting induced by a highly emetogenic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids given prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can prolong the colon assay, patients with anamnesty obstipation or signs of a subacute Ileus should be closely monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is required with simultaneous administration of Palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients where the Qt interval is extended or who tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, Alois is said to be used neither for prophylaxis or for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, palonosetron did not inhibit the activity of the five investigated chemotherapeutics (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabin, doxorubicin, and mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">A clinical study showed no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a unique intravenous Palonosetron and a steady-state- concentration of oral metocloplamids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population, the simultaneous addition of CYP2D6 inductors (Dexamethasone and Rifampicin) as well as CYP2D6 inhibitors (ammiodarone, doxorubicin, fluoxetine, haloperidol, kritonavir, sertraline and terbinafine) had no significant effect on the clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience regarding the use of Palonosetron in human pregnancies is not present, so Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women, unless it is considered necessary by the attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most frequent side effects observed with a dose of 250 micrograms (total of 633 patients), which were at least associated with Alois, were headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the location (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post marketing reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage there were similar occurrences of adverse events as in the other dosing groups; there were no dose-effect relationships to be observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies have been carried out, however, due to the large distribution volume, dialysis is probably not an effective therapy for an overdose of Alois.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients who received a moderate emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and 25mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and 25mg / m2 cyclophosphamide (half-value of 7.3 hours) were given that were given intravenously on day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomized double blind study, a total of 667 patients receiving a highly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazine as well as 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron were compared with patients who received 32 mg of ondansetron, which were given intravenously on day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study of highly emetogenic chemotherapy are combined in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) the effects of palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval were comparable with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the findings of preclinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular de- and repolarisation and prolong the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy volunteers was to evaluate the ECG effects of intravenous palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After IV administration follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average half-value of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the surface under the concentration time curve (AUC-∞) are generally dose-proportional in the entire dose range of 0.3-90 μ / kg for healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After IV administration of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) increase of the Palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day 5.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations indicate that once daily IV administration of 0.25 mg Palonosetron was comparable to that measured after one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg measured value; however, the Cmax was higher after the intake of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and around 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which, compared to Palonosetron, have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In vitro studies on the metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an IV single dose of 10 mcg / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, approximately 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as an immutable ingredient made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a unique intravenous bolt injection in healthy patients, the overall body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">In patients with severe liver dysfunction, terminale elift survival and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron are increased, however, a reduction of the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In preclinical studies, effects were only observed after expositions which are considered sufficient beyond the maximum human therapeutic exposure, suggesting a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 out of preclinical studies, evidence suggests that Palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular deformation and repolarization and can prolong the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose corresponded to the 30x of the therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given every day over two years, resulted in increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasma (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal marrow) and skin tumours in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages used and since Alois is intended for one-time use in humans, the relevance of these results is regarded as low for the human being.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) approved a negative report in which the approval of the marketing of the drug aimed at the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended Alphle6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"" "this means that Alpheon should resemble a biological drug called Roferon-A with the same medically effective ingredient that has already been approved in the EU (also called" "" "reference medicinal products" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In the case of a microscopic investigation, the liver tissue damages damage, moreover, the values of the liver enzyme Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in the blood abnormally be increased.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) has been introduced to stimulate the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Alpheon has presented data that demonstrate the comparison between Alpheon and Roferon-A (active ingredient structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of operation, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study on patients with hepatitis C, the efficacy of alphal was compared to the efficacy of the reference resin with 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded to the drug after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was stopped (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="2668">(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: mail @ emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int © EMEA 2006 / / www.emea.eu.int © EMEA is acknowledged.</seg>
<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns have been reported that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed should not be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon, the disease again flamed up in more patients than with the referral drug; alpheons also had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test used in the trial investigating the extent to which the drug responds to an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug) is not adequately validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat impetigo (a skin infection associated with crust formation) and small infected Lazerations (crack or cuts), abrasions and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by methicillint-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because it may not affect this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients with age of nine months, but patients under 18 years of age may not be more than 2% of the body's surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to treatment after two to three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell where proteins are produced) and thereby inhibits the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection had expired after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients with placebo responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin findings, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: if the results of both studies were viewed at skin wound, approximately 90% of the patients in both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo was not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (eiterfilled cavities in the body tissue) or of infections that were demonstrably or probably caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) is a irritation at the place of the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo were outweighed in the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmities, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted the company Glaxo Group Ltd. approval for the launch of Altargo throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In case of sensitizing or severe local irritation by using Retapamulin Salbe, the treatment is canceled, the ointment is carefully wiped out and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection is started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used to treat infections where MRSA is known as pathogen or suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">The efficacy of retapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected place occurs after a 2 to 3 day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations achieved in humans after topical application on a scrolled skin or infected superficial wounds, clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 According to oral administration of 2 times a day 200 mg of ketoconazol increased the median Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax according to topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe on scrolled skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dose adjustments are not considered necessary if topical resapamulin is applied during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the birth and fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be used during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retapamulin is preferable to the administration of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">When deciding whether the breastfeeding continues / ends or the therapy with altargo should be continued / stopped, balancing the benefit of breastfeeding for the baby and the benefit of the altargo therapy for the woman should be weighed down.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials to 2150 patients with superficial skin infections that have used Altargo, the most commonly reported side effect was irritation on the administration of the administration, which concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passgeerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The function mechanism of Retapamulin is based on the selective inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a certain binding site of the 50s subunit of the bacterial ribosome, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomally interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the binding point ribosomal protein L3 is involved in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the Peptidyltransferasecenter.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding at this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits Peptidyltransfer, block partial P-binding interaction and prevent normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If due to the local prevalence of resistance the use of Retapamulin at at least some infection forms appear questionable, a consultation should be sought by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">No differences in the in-vitro activity of Retapamulin against S.aureus were detected, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of non-response to the treatment at S.aureus, the presence of trunks with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamulin Salbe was applied daily under occlusion on intact and on peeled skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Out of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days of the topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Samples were taken on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and in the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic intake on humans for topical application of 1% ointment to 200 cm2 of peeled skin (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) was 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retapamulin in human liver microsomols was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, with lower participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were conducted over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In vitro screening on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in the rat-micro-core test for in-vivo study of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">Neither male nor female rats showed signs of reduced fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, resulting in an exposure to 5 times higher than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2 of skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study on rats were determined at oral dosages ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to the ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure (see above)), development toxicity (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The holder of the marketing authorization must ensure that a pharmaceutical vigilance system, as presented in the 1.8.1 of the application for authorisation (version 6.2) is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is applied.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The holder of the marketing authorization is obliged to carry out the detailed studies and additional pharmaceuticals vigilance activities in the pharmaceutical vigilance plan as described in Version 1 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and all additional updates of the RMP that are agreed with the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use, the updated RMP is to be submitted at the same time with the next Periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Avoid irritation or other signs and symptoms in the treated area, you should quit the application of Altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply any other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with Altargo if you have not been specifically prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be applied in the eyes, on the mouth or on the lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointment is on one of these surfaces, wash the spot with water and ask your doctor for advice if complaints occur.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After applying the ointment you can cover the affected area with a sterile dressing or a gazebo, unless your doctor has advised you not to cover the surface.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 years that are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of a two-dose-existing vaccination plan, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix should only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunization and is ensured that the vaccination plan can be brought to an end from two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is desired for hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or another hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines act by contributing to the immune system (the natural defense of the body), as it can fight against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">"" "after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises viruses and surface antigens as" "" "alien" "" "and produces antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components as the Vine Infrix vaccine that has been approved since 1996 and has been approved since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of a vaccination plan consisting of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix are adults identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the share of vaccinated children who had developed protective antibody concentrations a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study involving 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12 month interval between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix conducted between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children one month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations for hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that Ambirix's degree of protection was similar to a six-month and a 12 month interval between injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, fatigue) and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix should not be used in patients who are possibly hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other ingredients or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals a permit for the launching of Ambirix in the whole</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for primers with ambitions consists of two doses, the first dose is given at the date of the election and the second dose is given between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a booster set is desired for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B, vaccines can be vaccinated with the appropriate monovalent vaccines or combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-HBsAg (anti-HBsAg) anti-HBsAg (anti-HBsAg) and Anti-Hepatitis A Virus (anti-HV) antibodies are the same as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured whether immunocompetent persons who have responded to a Hepatitis A- vaccination require a booster effect as protection, as they may also be protected by immunological memory in case of no more detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injections, an anaphylactic reaction after the application of the vaccine should always be available immediately after the application of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a faster protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine, which contains 360 ELISA units formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In the case of hematalysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs-antibody-value is achieved under certain circumstances, so that in these cases, the administration of other vaccines can be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Because an intra-dermal injection or intramuscular administration of the gluteal muscle could lead to a suboptimal outcome, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disturbances, Ambirix can be injected exceptionally subcutaneously as it may occur in these cases after intramuscular administration to bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was administered in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined diphtherie-, tetanus, azellular pertussel, inactivated poliomyelitis- and haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects it must be assumed that there is possibly no adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults, the incidence of pain, redness, swelling, matchiness, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier thiomer and preservative-containing vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccine doses were administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years, Ambirix was compared with the 3-dose-combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and fatigue on a basis of computational treatment per vaccination dose, but not on the basis of a calculation base per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the administration of Ambirix in 50.7% of the subjects, compared with 39.2% of the subjects after the administration of a dose of the 3-dose-combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle, 66,4% of the subjects that had received Ambirix reported pain, compared to 63.8% of the subjects vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of match was comparable high per proband (i.e. about the entire vaccine cycle in 39.6% of the subjects receiving Ambirix compared to 36.2% of the subjects receiving the 3-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The incidence of severe pain and pain was low and comparable to those observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-doses vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1 to 11-year vaccinations, the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambirixgruppe was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3-dose-combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11-year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix was reported a frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The percentage of vaccines reported about severe side effects during the 2-doses vaccine with Ambirix or during the 3-doses vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of formalininactivated hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted on vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years, the anti-HAV serum conversion rates were 99.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, month 6 administered dose (that is, in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The seroconversion rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, at month 6 administered dose (that is, in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted at 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 received the standard combination vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 people whose immunogenicity was evaluable, the serum rotection rates (SP in the table below) against hepatitis B in month 2 and 6 were significantly higher compared with Ambirix in the month 2 and 6 after administration of the 3-dose vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune responses, which were reached in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11-year-olds one month after the full vaccination series (i.e., in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccines received either a 2-dose-vaccine with Ambirix or a 3-dose vaccine with a combination vaccine with a combination vaccine containing 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In people who were between 12 and 15 years old at the time of the primers, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after immunisation with Ambirix in the 0-6-month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response observed in this study was comparable to that after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine, consisting of 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated Hepatitis- A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- to including 15-year-olds it could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies is comparable 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme to the in the 0-12 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix in the second year of life was given at the same time with the booster formulation of a combined diphtheria-, tetanus, azellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis- and 8 Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar seroprotection and seroconversion rates as for earlier formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is to be examined both before and after the resusension on any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2780">If you / your child are already infected with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus before administration of both doses of vaccines (although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the vaccination time), vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">Protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms that are similar to those after hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection can not be mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If you / your child have already shown an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any component of this vaccine, including Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can be caused by itching rashes, shortness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue. • If you have an allergic reaction to a previous vaccination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B, if you / your child have a serious infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and before the usual administration of the second vaccination dosage).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a potential risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child of vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he / your child will recommend 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vaccination dose (360 ELISA units of a formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigens).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose for this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vaccination protection before the vaccination series ends.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes, Ambirix is injected with people suffering from severe bleeding disorders, under the skin and not in the muscle. • If you / your child is weak due to illness or treatment in your / her body's defences, or if you / your child will undergo a haemodialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals to vaccination can not be sufficient, allowing a blood test to be required to see how strong the reaction to vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take other medicines (including those that you can get without prescription) or if you / your child have been vaccinated recently / has received / has received / has received / has / or planned it in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine needs to be given at the same time with Ambirix should be vaccinated at separate spots and as many extremities as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix should be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine is nevertheless sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually, Ambirix will not administer pregnant or breastfeeding women, unless it is urgently required to vaccinate both hepatitis A and hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to neomycin (antibiotic) for you / your child.</seg>
<seg id="2796">If you miss the agreed appointment for the second vaccination, talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2797">♦ Very common (more than 1 case per 10 impregnated cans): • Pain or discomfort at the puncture or redness • Matness • irritability • headache • lack of appetite</seg>
<seg id="2798">♦ Frequent (up to 1 case per 10 impregnated cans): • swelling at the injection site • fever (over 38 ° C) • Overdiadedness • Gastro-intestinal disorders</seg>
<seg id="2799">Other side effects reported on days or weeks after vaccination with comparable combination or single vaccines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B are very rare (less than 1 case per 10,000 inimpregnated cans) are:</seg>
<seg id="2800">These include locally restricted or expanded rashes, which can be itchy or can be blistering, swelling of the eye contours and the face, difficult breathing or swallowing, sudden blood pressure drop and unconsciousness.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data that has become known since the launch of the first authorization for placing on the market, the CHMP has shown that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix is positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since Ambirix was only launched in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug is limited due to low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Amprapeseed can also be used in patients aged over a month with full enzyme defect or hyperammonia encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonia is - divided into several single doses at meals - swallowed, mixed under the food or administered via a Gastrostomieschlauch (through the stomach-blanket into the stomach of leading tubing) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach of leading tubing).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study, since Ammoncaps could not be compared with any other treatment or placebo (pseudo drug, i.e. without active ingredient).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Amprapescan also cause loss of appetite, abnormal acidity in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, taste disturbances or taste failure, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that ammonia in patients with disorders of the urea cycle effectively prevented high ammonia levels.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "amprapeseed was licensed under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "" "due to the rarity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information on this medicine." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients, in which a complete enzyme shortage has already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of the life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-manifest form (incomplete enzyme defect, which manifests after the first life month), there is an indication for the use of hyperammonia encephalopathy in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For babies, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders, AMMONAPS is also available in granulated form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for growth and development.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to the previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg and in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Carbamylphosphatsynthetase or Ornibscarbamylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with argininosuccinate syndrome require arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered to patients with difficulty swallowing, as there is a risk for the formation of esophagulcera if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2,7 mmol) sodium, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">Therefore, AMMONAPS should only be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or serious renal insufficiency as well as in associated clinical conditions associated with sodium retention and odema.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since the metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrat takes place over the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in pregnant women is not known; therefore, the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">Subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate on young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg) resulted in slowing down the neural increase and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and therefore a disability of the brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be ascertained whether phenylacetate is excreted in the mother's milk in humans, and for this reason, the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during breastfeeding (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, 56% of patients reported at least an adverse event (AE) and at 78% of these adverse events was assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic response to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported from an 18-year-old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with lactate can, severe hypokalemia, artery topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of an overdose occurred in a 5-month-old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms are accompanied by the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity in intravenous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is an active compound that is conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine which is excreted via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine can be compared with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); Phenylacetylglutamine is therefore an alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 Patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be believed to be produced for each gram of a sodium phenylbutyl dosage of 0.12 to 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine-nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started in order to improve survival chances and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of early symptoms in newborns was almost always unaffected, and the disease itself led to death in the treatment of peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analoga within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hematalysis, utilization of alternative methods of nitrogen excretion (sodium phenylbutyrat, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced corrosion and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborns at postpartal (however within the first life month) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">Patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and had already been treated prior to the first occurrence of hyperammonia encephalopathy was 100% survival, but even in these patients it was time for many mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygous form of the Ornibscarbamylase deficiency), who recovered from hyperammonia encephalopathy and subsequently treated permanently with sodium phenylbutyrat and a protein-reduced diet, survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible even in treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrin is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in liver and kidney with glutamine, where phenylacetylglutamine is produced.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined by adding a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, haemoglobin metabolism, and repeated doses of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (uncontrolled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients with intravenous sodium phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in tablet form, measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were detected 15 minutes after ingestion.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urea-dysfunctions or hemoglobbinopathies, phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) was not detectable in the next morning after night fasting.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with liver cirrhosis, which were repeatedly treated with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the mean phenylacetate concentrations in the plasma label were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">The medication is excreted from the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80-100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of the Micronucleus test, sodium phenylbutyrin with toxic and non-toxic doses had no conceal effects (investigation 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granulate is either taken orally (infants and children who can't swallow any tablets, or patients with swallowing) or a gastrointestinal parasite or a nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to the previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of more than 20 kg and in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Carbamylphosphatsynthetase or Ornibscarbamylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS pellets containing 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrat, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat-flutes were exposed to phenylacetate (active metabolism of phenylbutyrat) before the birth, lesions in the pyramidal cells of the cortex occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic response to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported from an 18-year-old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in conjunction with lactate can, severe hypokalemia, artery topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine can be compared with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); Phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for excretion of surplus</seg>
<seg id="2858">Investigations on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be believed to produce a sodium phenylbutyl dosage of 0.12 to 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible even in treatment, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in granulated form, measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were detected 15 minutes after intake.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During durability the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this procedure, the small measuring scoop contains 0.95 g, the mean measuring scoop 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrat amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they cannot excrete the nitrogenous waste products which accumulate in the body after eating proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If laboratory tests are carried out, you must inform the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS, because sodium phenylbutyrat may affect the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2866">If you are taking AMMONAPS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During breastfeeding, you should not take AMMONAPS, as the medicine may go over to breast milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases, confusion, headache, taste disturbances, decay of the hearing, disoritism, memory disorders and a deterioration of existing neurological conditions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you notice any of these symptoms, contact your doctor or hospital's emergency department for the purpose of introducing appropriate treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2870">If you forgot to take AMMONAPS, take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal.</seg>

<seg id="2878">31 • Remove from the container a heaped measuring spoon of granulate. • Fill a straight edge, e.g. a knife back over the top edge of the measuring spoon to remove excess granulate. • Receiving the recommended number of measuring spoons granules from the container.</seg>
<seg id="2879">Angiox is used for the treatment of adult patients with "acute coronary syndromes" (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example with unstable angina (a form of pain in the thorax with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) (abnormal measurement value in electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who undergo a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This may help in patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14,000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angiox at allotal administration or in combination with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIa-inhibitor (GPI, another medicine to prevent blood clots) was compared with conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI the patient was often a stent (a short tube left in the artery to prevent closure) and additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots, such as abuximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, angiox - with or without the administration of GPI - was as effective as conventional treatment in the prevention of new events (death cases, heart attacks or revascularization) after 30 days or a year.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients undergoing a PCI, Angiox was as effective as Heparin in terms of all indicators, except for heavy bleeding where it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Bivalirudin, other Hirudine or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may also not be used in patients who recently had bleeding, as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is an acceptable substitute for Heparin during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the Medicines Company UK Ltd approval for the Marketing Authorisation of Angiox in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina / non-ST leverage attack (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of emergency intervention or if early intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended starting dose of angiox in patients with ACS is an IV dosage of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is subsequently performed with the patient, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to clinical requirements, the reduced infusion dosage of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be resumed for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure, a dosage of 0.5 mg / kg is to be administered, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial IV indication of 0.75 mg / kg of body weight and one immediately subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of an exclusive bolus administration of Angiox has not been investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to less than 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicinal product should be carefully mixed prior to the application and the dosage must be administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">A lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used in patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR 30-59 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is less than 225 seconds, a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose should be checked again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate renal damage included in the phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which led to approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after giving the Bivalidatdin-Bolus without any dose adjustment on average 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in patients with dialysis, angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after termination of the intravenous administration of fractionated Heparin or 8 hours after termination of the subcutaneous administration of low-molecular heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• known hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or other ingredients or against Hirudine • active haemostasis and / or irreversible bacterial endocarditis. • severe uncontrolled hypertension and subacute bacterial endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and in patients with dialysis</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when bivalirudin is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even though most of the arterial puncture points occur in PCI patients under Bivalirudin, patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may present bleeding during treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who take Warfarin and treated with Bivalirudin, a monitoring of the INR value (International Regular Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after discontinuation of the treatment with the Bivalidator reaches the level before the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge about the action mechanism of anticoagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolysis or Thrombocytes aggregate), it can be assumed that these active substances increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bivalidates with thrombocyte aggregators or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological hemostaseparameters can be checked regularly in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Animal experiments related to pregnancy, embryonic and fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development are insufficient (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomized to Bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomized to Bivalirudin plus GPII / IIIa inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either unfractionated Heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPII / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the Bivalirudin group and in the comparison groups treated with Heparin, women and patients over 65 years were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding was defined according to ACUITY and Timi scales for severe bleedings as in the footnotes of table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and severe bleedings were significantly less frequent under Bivalirudin than in the groups with Heparin plus GPII / IIIa inhibitor and Bivalidrudin plus GPII / IIIa- or inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the puncture area, reduced hemoglobin levels ≥ 5 cm at the point of puncture, reduction of haemoglobin levels ≥ 3 g / dl with well-known bleeding area, reoperation due to bleeding, use of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Other, less frequently observed localisations that occurred at more than 0.1% (occasional) were "other" puncture sites, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information on side effects is based on the data of a clinical trial with Bivalidatine in 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivalirudin group and in the comparison groups treated with Heparin, women and patients over 65 years were more likely to have adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and severe bleedings were significantly less common in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPII / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, were reported in practice after a comprehensive application and are grouped in table 6 according to system organ classes.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of an overdose, the treatment with the Bivalirudin is to be stopped immediately and the patient is close meshed with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalirudin, a direct and specific drug inhibitor, which binds to the catalytic centre as well as in the ion binder region of thromboin, regardless of whether thromboins are tied in the fluid stage or clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">Binding of Bivalidatdin to thromboin, and hence its effect, is reversible, because thromboin slowly splits the binding of Bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4, thereby regenerating the function of the active centre of thromboin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Furthermore, by using a bivalidator with serum from patients who had previously appeared to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS), no platelet aggregation reaction was induced.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years onwards with diabetes that require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) injected into the abdominal wall, thighs or upper arm or administered as permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels (sugars) in the blood or cannot process insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lucine is very slightly different from the human insulin, and the change means that it acts faster and has a shorter duration of action than a short-acting insulin analog.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra has been studied in the application in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study involving 572 children aged 4-17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In Type 2 diabetes, in which the body is unable to work effectively, Apidra was examined in a study involving 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study involving adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was found in the first study compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin lipid.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the decrease in HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin secretion or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the launching of Apidra throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is to be applied as subcutaneous injection either in the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle or to be applied subcutaneously through continuous infusion in the area of the abdominal wall.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced glucose tolerance capacity and reduced insulin metabolism, the need for insulin can be reduced in patients with a reduction in liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the effective strength, the brand (manufacturer), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc delay, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can result in a change in the insulin demand.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An insufficient dose or breakdown of treatment, especially in patients with an insulin-charged diabetes, may lead to hyperglycemia and a diabetic ketoacidosis; these states are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may necessitate a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the effectiveness of the insulin used and can therefore change during the conversion of the treatment regimen.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances that can increase blood sugar-lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypoglycemias include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, diopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase, propoxyphene, salizylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, the symptoms of adrenergic counterregulation can be weakened or missing under the influence of sympathetic such as beta blockers, clonidine, guanethidin and reserve.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between Insu- linglucsin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin flow occurs in human breast milk, but generally insulin is not absorbed either into mother's milk, nor is it absorbed by oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are listed adverse drug reactions reported from clinical trials (very often: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; rarely: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold sweat, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, lack of concentration, drowsiness, excessive hun-, changes in vision, headaches, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Is missed to continuously change the injection site within the injection area, can result in a lipodystrophy at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemias with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), given by an appropriately trained person, or intravenous medication of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucose injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose intake (in particular skeletal musculature and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in the subcutaneous GA- be of insulin absorption the effect occurs faster and the duration of action is shorter than with normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male subjects at the age of 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes myocarcine, insulin lucine in the therapeutic dose ranges from 0,075 to 0,15 E / kg showed a proportional, glucose-lowering effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucose-lowering effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lucine has twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the total glucosal effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data showed that 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post-prandiale glycaemic control is achieved with an application of insulin-lulisin like with a normal normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin was sliced 2 minutes before the meal, a better postprandiale check was achieved than with a normal normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin absorption is turned 15 minutes after the start of the meal, comparable glycaemic control is achieved, such as with a normal insulin analog, which is given 2 rents before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lucine at a dose of 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the start of the meal compared to the normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min.) before the start of the meal (figure 1A) as well as compared to the normal insulin that was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin lucine at a dose of 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterward) after the beginning of the meal compared to human Nor- malinsulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the start of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
