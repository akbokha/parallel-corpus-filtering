the Language module can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; translate the menu under Extras web page . select the source and target language of the translation from the drop @-@ down list .
if a part of the text is selected , only this part will be translated into place of the entire &amp; URL .
translations are very ru@@ di@@ mentary . bab@@ el@@ fish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . therefore , the translations are not subject to any important decisions , without checking the translation beforehand .
only web pages on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be compiled on the Bab@@ el@@ fish page itself , where you can insert translated texts directly .
package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite their small size , they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them easier available .
more information about the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings enh@@ ancements .... Open the Tools menu and select the modules you want .
this is a list of standard custom@@ ization modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that there may be more modules on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Tools crashes . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of crashes , if available , er@@ ase .
the module view filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras view filter . with the module you can filter or kon@@ quer@@ or ; s current working directory in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Tools DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . as a default , the ad begins with the root node of the document , example : docum@@ ent@@ Element , all other nodes are sub@@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; represents a further view of objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
the special feature of &amp; FS@@ View is to graphi@@ cally display ne@@ sted order hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree map . each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View ; the size of a file or folder is mirr@@ ored , the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the entries in it . thus , large files , even then easily identified , can be easily identified if it is far down in the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View may be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your file system . for easier navigation , the rectang@@ les have meaningful color and labelling settings .
the color of a rectangle that is switched over View color mode can either display depth for easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or picture of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the respective file or folder . for each property you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space to display or whether the area is to be used by subordin@@ ate rectang@@ les . furthermore , you can set the relative position of the let@@ tering in the rectangle .
with representation algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View ; this goal is not always respected . frames are drawn to indicate the ne@@ sting of entries , and this frame will need space that will then lose the subordin@@ ate entries . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is square .
how to partition the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . here it is always advantageous for labelling and avoiding space losses through boxes to create rectang@@ les that are as square as possible . the best methods in this respect are lines , columns or recur@@ sive division .
you can set the minimum shown area for an entry via the menu entry View An@@ gle at surface . instead , a space pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally , &amp; FS@@ View was designed as a small test application and introduction to using the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get developed for the K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind application .
the picture gallery module can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras photo gallery ... or by C@@ trl ; I .
when you visit the image gallery module , a dialog opens , which allows you to set the image of the gallery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tit@@ le of page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; option allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Picture per line option has a sli@@ der and a turning field to set the number of mini frames of each line in the gallery .
with the check box File name of the image , specify whether the file names are displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
with the check box File size of the image , specify whether the file size is displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
with the check box image size you specify whether the size of the images is displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
in the dialog box , specify where the gallery will be saved and which sub@@ folders are to be included .
in the Save In HTML file , specify where the HTML page is to be saved .
with the check box to include sub@@ folders , you can set with a sli@@ der or a turn panel to which level the sub@@ folders are included .
copy the original pictures with the check box to see if the original pictures are to be copied to the gallery .
use the comment text box to specify a comment file for cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery .
in the check box sel@@ e color depth , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails than in the original pictures .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings gives you easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :
media playback for the navigation pane can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Windows Navigation Pan@@ e or with the F@@ 9 keyboard short@@ cut .
to play , click in the navigation pane of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback .
changing browser _ identi@@ fier adds a menu entry in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , which allows you to change browser and operating system recognition for single domains . this is useful for web pages that allow access only with certain browsers .
the default browser identi@@ fier of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you come to a website that refuses access with this browser , you can change browser detection in one of the following options .
changes the identi@@ fier in M@@ SI@@ E for pages that reject the access with browsers on the base of Mozilla . for example , you need M@@ SI@@ E browser identification to call up with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail .
pages that do not comply with the W3@@ C standard or use their own &amp; HTML ; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identification of this out@@ dated browser .
with this option , the default browser identi@@ fier is used for all pages of the site you are currently visiting .
with the menu entry Add ... you can set the scope of the information about the browser used and the operating system in the individual .
with this &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; module review your &amp; CSS ; style sheets and &amp; HTML ; documents in accordance with the recommendations of the W3@@ C and other standards .
you can check the module website in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; check the menu under Extras website . you can check the following tests :
with the &amp; HTML ; check whether your &amp; HTML ; -@@ document of the syntax of &amp; HTML ; corresponds to all found errors are displayed . with this review you can make sure your pages are displayed correctly by all browsers .
allows you to check your &amp; CSS ; style sheets incorporated in a &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; document . with valid &amp; CSS ; your web pages have a uniform look regardless of the browser you are using .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided so that you can connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ code ; albums can be downloaded . more than 1,000 digital cameras are supported using the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , any media and card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; Edit .
&amp; Edit ; includes a fast image processing with basic image editing tools . you can use this to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can easily be extended with K@@ DE Image plug @-@ ins interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ code ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works fully in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion by li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC color management workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; via the camera or the lens that can be searched for .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ plug ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of end users . you should therefore report problems and improvement possibilities .
&amp; Edit ; tries to make the reporting of problems or improvement suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . if you use this short@@ cut , your web browser opens a page in the error reporting system . all required information is already registered here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam ; if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , we would like to encourage you to answer questions to other users of &amp; Edit here . however , in this mail@@ ing@@ list English is spoken , you should be powerful this language .
you can also digi@@ plug ; visit home page to learn news about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ code ; to learn .
the best way to get to &amp; digi@@ code ; to participate is registration in the developer mailing list . instructions to log in in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ code ; .
when you &amp; Edit ; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your images and your database . you can specify a local , remote or removable folder . just enter the path name or click the folder icon folder icon to select a folder .
in the second field , you must specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data ab@@ n@@ k is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many files as you want . &amp; Edit ; will also use as an al@@ b library . settings digi@@ K@@ am set up collections
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder that contains images as base folders . &amp; Edit ; view each sub@@ folder as an album . no image is altered .
&amp; Edit ; En@@ tries recur@@ sively the library path in its full depth . you cannot exclude sub @-@ folders unless it is in hidden folder . this allows you to do extra bs &amp; digi@@ pe@@ des ; do by inser@@ ting a dot in front of the sub@@ folder name .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in my Al@@ ben@@ List have no photos as symbols . you can change that by taking any photo from the album and placing it on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can Edit &amp; Edit ; set up your digital camera . then you should learn how to use My Albums and My keyword list to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , you can Edit &amp; Edit ; possibly also deal with it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu Help Com@@ par@@ ative Support .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided so that you can connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ code ; albums can be downloaded . more than 1,000 digital cameras are supported using the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , any media and card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; Edit .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera is often used as a disk drive . the camera can also be connected via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; Edit ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 to communicate with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , distributed software collection for digital cameras which supports an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer . since photos generally are big files and transfers over the serial port are slow , this connection is now out@@ dated . &amp; digi@@ plug ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
the ex@@ if support is required by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera operators to read the thumb@@ nails . if the Ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may not be able to see thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things in &amp; digi@@ code ; is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ plug ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ v@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as a user can . their advantage is that it is much easier , &amp; digi@@ code ; by writing a small module to complete a function when the changes were made in &amp; Edit ; itself .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
drawing and dropping pictures works everywhere : you can place an image in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ tree , above the horizontal divi@@ der line or into another application window . the only limitation is that a picture cannot be placed in keywords , date list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to select the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is only used for the fields displayed in the toolbar at present . this way the filter will only work on the file name if this is shown in the symbol view . which fields are displayed you can configure in the Al@@ ben@@ Setup dialog .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ pi@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos managed by &amp; Edit are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders where they were stored on the hard disk , after the name of their collection in the Album properties or after the date on which the album was created first . the date can be changed in the properties of the album .
if you have set up a scanner you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select to scan album im@@ porting images . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album .
in order to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse onto the target album and drop it down . in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album properties , right click on the album and select Edit properties in the context menu .
alb@@ um@@ - Coll@@ ections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection from you is used to sort your photos when you sort your collection from the toolbar or sort the View albums . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the settings for collections .
the Alb@@ um@@ - Date : used when you sort your albums by date with View Mem@@ ories sorted by date .
the El@@ der buttons , average , New Year : they set the date to the oldest , the latest image or the average of the album . to do this first attempts to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , instead the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder .
when you first open an album &amp; digi@@ plug ; open , the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ pi@@ quot ; this should help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , you must click the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu &amp; quot ; As album preview app@@ en@@ quot ; select . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can always only be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; Edit ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the section My keyword list at the bottom left of the main window . album collections have a different effect . the collection always includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window provides the main view of your photos . when you select an album , all images in this album are displayed in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magni@@ fying buttons in the toolbar .
when you open an album for the first time , you have to wait a bit while the thumb@@ nails are generated . you can avoid this by using the Tools menu to recre@@ ate all preview images .
information on each image is displayed below the preview pane . what information these are , you can change Edit Settings ; set it up . select the albums page here and adjust the preview images to your preferences .
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . if you leave the mouse poin@@ ter for a moment over a picture . the help shows the most important features including all the tags of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the introduction to the main window displays such help window .
photos are all you need to do with &amp; Edit . albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures in a way that suits you . image processing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them . you can choose between looking at the pictures , a slide show or the editing of the images .
you can open the image editing with a photo by clicking either F@@ 4 image Edit ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and Edit ... . in the Edit section , you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos . with image editing , you can view and edit your photos .
it may happen that &amp; Edit ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the application from the sub@@ menu of opening . for this , and how to customize it to your needs , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after processing , other image editing programs may cause problems with the met@@ a @-@ data contained in the image . some programs do not store these data when you store the modified image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data such as orientation , aperture , etc .
&amp; Edit ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest option is to right @-@ click on the preview to select and rotate . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the filen@@ ame of a photo , right click on the preview and select F@@ 2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you retain the extension ( .@@ jp@@ g , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you delete a photo &amp; digi@@ plug ; delete it , it will be moved into the tr@@ ash bin of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 Del@@ ete or Del . if you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
&amp; quot ; My data sli@@ der quot ; organizes your photos on the basis of the data . &amp; digi@@ code ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of last modification of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the date view to show you only the photos of the selected days .
keywords are provided with a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search .
when a keyword is selected , all the photos marked with this keyword will be displayed .
tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your tags lo@@ gically . you can also easily find parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword li@@ ft@@ quot ; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . so , you can also use your keywords in other programs . furthermore , the keywords are re @-@ imported when you lose the database ; the images are noticed .
you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking either &amp; quot ; My keyword quot ; or click on an existing keyword and then select a keyword . if you add a new keyword after clicking on an existing keyword , this keyword will be the keyword for this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by drag@@ ging it to the desired position in the tree and placing it there . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to post@@ p@@ one the keyword . a keyword can only be in the tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a keyword by right @-@ clicking and editing keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and icon in the tree &amp; quot ; My stit@@ ch .
to select another photo as an album icon , select the image with the right mouse button and select Set As a album preview in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
this can happen in two ways : as soon as you select the photos you want to provide with a keyword , you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My stit@@ ch &amp; quot ; drag and drop it there . alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the preview of the images and select keywords from the context menu .
you can choose a photo with any number of tags . the photo is displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way you can set a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event in which it was made etc .
as soon as you have a photo with keywords , this will be displayed in the main window under the preview of the image .
you can remove a keyword in which you right @-@ click the context menu of the photo and select Remove from the Tags menu . the menu only shows the tags assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view displays a time @-@ dependent adju@@ dic@@ ated hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved via this hist@@ ogram . to select a tim@@ ef@@ r@@ ame you just need to click on the lower rectangle of the box that displays the time unit . this will display all associated images in the main window .
in the field below , you can enter a title and save your selection . this then appears in the list below .
includes all the elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and more .
if you click here , the filtering is deleted and all the images are displayed again . if the search has not found anything , then the lamp becomes red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tabs in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ oc@@ ulars . if you open this , you will see a simple search box as described above . you can save this search here but as a live search , which always filters what you have entered as search criteria .
when you are satisfied with your selection , hit the head OK and the search is done . the results will be displayed in my search list in the main window . the text box Save search as is used to select a name in my search list . if you want to change your selection after the search again , you just need to select the appropriate entry from the View list and select an option in its context menu .
if you select to edit search , the form will appear to enter the search again with the search information previously entered . if you choose to edit as extended search , the dialog will appear for the extended search to change your previous search . more information can be found in the section The tool for Advanced Search .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete from the Search context menu .
advanced Search provides an advanced search form with many search parameters to search in certain fields of &amp; Edit ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the search query options in the Al@@ ben@@ Database . all rules are displayed in line , separated by operators . an option can be added to the search group / Search group . each option can be linked to others through the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ... you can create search of the type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; .
&amp; digi@@ code ; characterized each picture by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two picture signatures , the more they match . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop each image to find a similar . if you slide an image from somewhere along the symbol of in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , it will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : free hand colour sketch : draw a quick sketch and &amp; digi@@ plug ; find the right pictures . also here you can set a threshold value .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble miniature program . you can move in or out with the mouse wheel or hold it . move it while you press the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this of course pres@@ upp@@ oses that your images contain ge@@ o data .
in the field below , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this is then added for later use of the list below . it works like a live ge@@ o folder .
&amp; Edit ; provides a lumin@@ aire in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L Add to the lumin@@ aire from the context menu . the selection is added to the lumin@@ aire and its window opens . when you are back in &amp; digi@@ plug ; main window , you can quickly open the lumin@@ aire with L Extras .
from the preview strip you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right side of the window . a small arrow tells you which copy in which window area is to be seen . if you select preview from the toolbar and perform zoo / sliding operations on one of the images , then these are also carried out with the other image . so you can compare the same area of the two images .
another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images . if you navigate in pairs from the toolbar , then the first two images are automatically loaded into the areas to compare . use the left mouse button on any preview image to display it in the right pane . this makes it easier to work through a number of similar pictures .
of course , the normal deletion actions also work directly out of the lumin@@ aire like e.g. F@@ 4 file ...
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available in the illuminated table for both preview images . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each section you will find a built @-@ in swivel function , which you can see on the crossed arrows . to t@@ anning the visible area of the picture , you need to click on them and hold the &amp; L@@ MB . in the Pre@@ view mode both pictures will show the same image area .
the zo@@ oming is the same as in other views . just use the zoom sli@@ der under the images or C@@ trl ; scroll to zoom in and out . this happens in both pictures when you are in the Pre@@ view mode .
digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken to final output and permanent storage . each of the photos records , scans or stores digital photos results in a form of digital inventory management . most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up , find , protect and use photos . we focus on the procedures for digital photographers using &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zing ; we look at the download , ren@@ ame , remove , organize , archive , optimize , wait and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital stock management assumes , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , sec@@ ures , transforms , assem@@ bles and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is in accordance with your definition data that provide information about or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
I dare to say if you find more than 1000 photos on your computer then you need to find no longer a certain photo without inventory administration . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you definitely don &apos;t use Edit &amp; Edit ; . the approach to store the metadata in both a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searching and a secure archiving solution that you can access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you enter your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must be organized somehow on your computer . you need to decide whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure that you have to switch to a larger drive some@@ time .
you may be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times at the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; then export is a folder for pictures you can print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have different requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images to different subjects and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % of archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new files .
the separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative image .
we also recommend the option to save metadata in the editing page of metadata into &amp; Edit . this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the corresponding point in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what if you want to change what you want to change ? add &amp; Edit ; a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . of course these are the most important ones .
now the real work starts , since you should now assign words , cap@@ tions and a rating to each photo . of course you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense as you can focus on the best photos during the further work .
now let &apos;s start with keywords , keywords , as you would expect in other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import cat@@ alog@@ u@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ code ; automatically set up the tree for you , or edit the images to the right place . sorting the hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can easily be done by drag@@ ging a sub @-@ tree to another . the changed keywords are edited by &amp; Edit ; updated while tracking the sub@@ trees .
the graph shows how different metadata inter@@ s@@ ect each block . this is a very rough representation since each block of metadata is in truth from many sections . filen@@ ames and calendar data refer to properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you don &apos;t want to let anybody see your photos just , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies .
take a look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it , then you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you that this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . w@@ ow ! you begin to dream , associations , memories , the historical period is present again , you may even hear the silence .
for others who consider your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer to help him understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone .
with &amp; Edit , you can save as many text as you want in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , as labelling . you can even export it for a selection of images . if you export your images into web galleries , then these labels are exported according to your wishes in the let@@ tering and / or the title of the web gallery system .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of spatial presentation now drives with speed of light .
the possibilities of using ge@@ ol@@ ocation are already countless and will become even deeper in the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually recre@@ ate your travels using images with geographic information . &amp; digi@@ kam ; can also export k@@ ml files that you can open with Goo@@ gle@@ Earth . you can also export the images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and den@@ otes the practice of using copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ edoms also apply in all changed versions , i.e. also for the works of others .
the following description tells you which information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ kam ; should be stored as information :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the photographer who created the photo . if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer , e.g. to protect the photographer &apos;s identity , then the name of a company or organization can be used . this field does not support comm@@ as or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators .
author title ( syn@@ onym for author &apos;s title ) : linked to the author . this field contains the job description of the photographer . examples for this may be titles such as : hired photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for provider ) : use the provider &apos;s field to identify who offers the photo . if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associated Press , then these organizations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others . if the picture is a bearing photo , then here the group / agency that offers the picture is given here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , even though they offer no protection against abuse . anyone who has a little bit more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator can delete or change these , in the image . for private individuals , this is very important for most of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ code ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .

of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire here . these types of losses are the same that can happen to you with traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section it &apos;s about problems with the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery firm , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss .
to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , you need to be treated carefully and you can &apos;t trust yourself longer than a few years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer , get more difficult and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece that claims a lifetime of 100 years for yourself .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable . so it &apos;s about selecting the right DVD .
75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control sums . despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scratches , dust &amp; etc ;
for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that apparently causes wonders on CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; however , it is not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical Media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to win the format war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disk can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a Dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB .
do not burn the media with a description , date &amp; author , and then store on a clean , dark dry and protected site . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media .
disc@@ laim@@ ers retain your stat@@ s for themselves . your manufacturers &apos; warran@@ ties include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the troubleshooting mechanisms of hard drives : floppy Study
in short : dis@@ cos last the longest if you operate in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. Electronic parts of the controller are the most common error reason , S@@ MA@@ RT can not detect these errors . some of S@@ MA@@ RT @-@ identified errors indicate immediate im@@ pending failure .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you backup the files , but these losses can usually be recovered without any major problems .
while most electrical devices don &apos;t matter much , it looks different in devices with computer chips and high speed processors . these can cause serious damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause locked key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware switches , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . so protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against current peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a portion of the energy heat and avoids the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in bar . remember that not every connector bar also contains over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also take care that it provides protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage can use any cable to your computer , you should pay attention to the fact that all peripheral devices that are connected to your system are protected as well . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage cont@@ actors that also include a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . therefore , it can be useful to invest in an un@@ interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protecting against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs . some models allow you to continue working until the current goes back . if you purchase a UPS , you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting .
consider the potential risk your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with the cost of avoiding this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can cost you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it . at the end , you should always think about getting all cables before you go on holiday .
Amazon Web Service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can mount it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . Google shared storage is another popular offer that you can store any amount of data .
you are compared to the hard drives at home however very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data via the comparatively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a common backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are fed to photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online . the professional version provides you with unlimited storage , which should be checked in reality first .
from the point of view of the data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and in the large companies the offer includes a backup and a distributed memory . thus , they are disaster @-@ proof .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all transfers are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . all of these disturbances are un@@ discovered until you open a photo and this is destroyed for your surprise . no one seems to have ever thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much secure data path than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors continue un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with disk failures on a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a license for Solaris and Leopard with a GP@@ L license . we can only hope that it will soon be available for Linux and Windows . read this article in English .
Oracle has started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem , which is still in alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms the Z@@ FS is used and is also available for Linux ; it is still not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss of not@@ ebook and 46 % for work@@ station systems .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to lower damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; for a long time nobody has been si@@ ghted .
open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ F@@ s and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process at a sudden stop during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not saved completely before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are located 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings from fundamental physical borders . this means that while the technology is further developed there is a natural boundary for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is worse . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even DS@@ LR cameras require a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard disk today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t make anybody else responsible for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year . therefore , backup your data often to a plan and test this backup before you make any dangerous like the re@@ installation of your operating system , the exchange of disks or the size change of hard drives .
suppose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , a lightning strikes you are lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes local and destro@@ ys a lot . forget planes of aircraft : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ef@@ ts are dangerous enough for your data . they usually concern a whole room or the entire house .
therefore disaster prevention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into your neighbour house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as already said above is a common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not available immediately , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot of two times : the complete backup and the last differential backup .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . creates multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time where such a backup has been made . this backup comes closest to a version@@ ing system with the exception that it is only sam@@ pled and not ongoing .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have actually been changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security through s@@ sh .
save important images directly after you have saved them on your computer on a DVD or other optical media .
at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . any further di@@ lution should happen manually after you have made a complete review .
topics : metadata , IP@@ TC data stored in the image file , retain associated X@@ MP files , retain original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ ent images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing tools , ... , using the Internet .
so that valuable pictures survive the next 40 years that is approximately the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies to be considered :
as the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate as time goes by . unfortunately , there is no other possibility than a certain vig@@ il@@ ance for@@ wards . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should be answered by the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your storage and backup technology , or file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the expression of the ability to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing the size of the system .
let &apos;s assume that you have included the scal@@ ability and the area you want to enlarge to a dedicated disk or partition . at * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and move it to a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new disk was detected by the system , but do not hang it .
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ ad@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ ad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of the drive if necessary
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software that can read it , then you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more .
PNG has been developed as an open source standard that should replace the GIF . it can save much more . it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 bits per color channel and full transparency . PNG may contain relative many administrative information , but not as many as TIFF and a slow compression . this format we would recommend to save your pictures .
TIFF was widely used as image format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with loss@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ l@@ ates ) . it manages high @-@ quality images , but requires very large files . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative File Format is a license @-@ free and open frame format that was developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG was developed based on the TIFF / EP format and obliged to use metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers already provides D@@ NG and we hope that the competi@@ tor Canon and Nikon will use it at some point .
this is possibly one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block quot ; technology of the 90@@ s . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording , mostly in raw format , as it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems with the link between the metadata file and the image file . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put it all together .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata initiative is an open organization that supports fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard compounds and educational efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of met@@ a @-@ data standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera edi@@ um , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them to your bulk archive . this function is not yet implemented .
for a subtle editing , you can use external programs . if you edit the images with &amp; Edit ; edit , then you should add metadata again . they may be cut off from the other programs .
protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them then in web galleries , en@@ code them in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos into &amp; digi@@ plug ; to get . in the Adding a photo to an album , you can add a description of how to add photos you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ Database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; to use , connect it to the computer , turn the camera to the display mode and turn on . a further description of this can be found in the manual of your camera .
if you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a Fer@@ tig -@@ indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for the software application will be displayed on the camera for each file , photos , movies , music , etc .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the features and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog displays file properties and photo information that is internally stored by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
this information is the same as the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; Edit ; or image editing . note that these metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection of all . this downloads all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; Edit ; . when downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you check if the photos were securely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all photos , you can select only the desired selection methods from &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the Download button and download the selected one . download the selected download button until you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New is available . these pictures have not been edited by &amp; Edit until now . in this case , the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window . if you select this option , only the new pictures will be downloaded .
when you download all the albums or download the selected albums , a dialog with which you can select the target studio will appear in which the photos are stored . the list of the existing albums will be shown in the My Albums tab . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after selecting the destination album , press OK , and &amp; Edit ; loads the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the photos you want , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once by del@@ eting the Del@@ ete key . if you just want to delete some , you need to select them first and then delete selected er@@ ase .
please note that there is no way to recover photos that you deleted from the camera . you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully removed from the camera before you delete them from the camera . if you want to delete the camera path completely , you should do this via the camera system , as this is much faster .
the filen@@ ames are usually re@@ used after the photos have been deleted from the camera . this can lead to double filen@@ ames , if you load photos from different recording locations into the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time on which the image was taken into the file name .
in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for date @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created automatically per day .
the options Dur@@ ing the transfer opens three more options that are performed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two relate the data about the author in the Standard auto @-@ identity section . if you select this , the corresponding entries from the Ex@@ if information are copied to the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures .
for example , if you want a different date format than the standard format , for example , in the edit field , you can use the pre@@ fix fot@@ o- % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % h : % M : % S . to do so , turn on the date &amp; time option . for further custom@@ ization , read the str@@ f@@ time command .
if you use the option camera file name , you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters when downloading . or in upper case , if you prefer this .
the new file name , that &amp; digi@@ code ; is used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your ren@@ aming settings are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time .
&amp; Edit ; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform automatic rotation during sh@@ utter . not all cameras provide this information . in the section bar section , you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually turned on and when your camera does not supply this information , &amp; digi@@ code ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation in the lower area of the window .
when your camera provides information about the date in which the photo was taken , you can use Edit to automatically create sub @-@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ a data section you can read which information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is usually turned off , and in this case it saves &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to turn on this option . to do so , use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the Download button . then select Upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files you want to upload . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; node ; methods .
after the image selection is done , you ask and digi@@ code ; you , where the images are to be uploaded . select the folder you want and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means a position indicated in long@@ itude and l@@ atitude and can be displayed on a map . the data can be determined by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data . environmental planner , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you have forgotten where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser which shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ plug ; users who want to locate the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that exi@@ v2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and map references . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via a post @-@ processing of the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical assignment ( manual ) and last about manual input of familiar locations .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS receivers . either as map module or by transmitting the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you must save this data in the g@@ p@@ x format , since this is the only format supported by the ge@@ o @-@ mapping module .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the l@@ atitude and l@@ atitude or other data then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool from Phi@@ l Harv@@ ey . it uses the template beha@@ ved coordinates created for example by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show any European maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , showing all the navigation details for Europe .
&amp; Edit ; tries to give you so much control over its workflow as possible . there are many settings that modify the behavior of Edit . to access these settings , you need to Edit Settings Edit Settings ; select . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left .
select action can be displayed on embedded preview or editing image editing . you set the standard behavior of &amp; Edit ; specify when you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface . even in database synchron@@ isation , these data are written in the IP@@ TC fields .
author title is a syn@@ onym for author &apos;s title : this field should contain the professional title of the photographer . this can be labels such as contracted photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author field , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to indicate the photo that the photo offers . this does not have to be the author , if it is for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associated Press , then these organizations should be listed here because this is the image of other &amp; quot ; quot ; . if the picture is a bearing photo , then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC Fel@@ der@@ . by this it is achieved that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the Edit &amp; Edit database ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ code ; imported without going lost .
save image cap@@ tions as embedded descriptions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the images . this allows your cap@@ tions to be read by other image viewers .
the Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse poin@@ ter rests over a file in the main window . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; Edit ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which types of file &amp; digi@@ code ; to display , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . any file in one &amp; Edit ; Alb@@ um@@ folder that has none of these extensions , by &amp; Edit ; ignored .
you can reset the default settings by pressing the Update button to the right of each category .
everytime you open the lumin@@ aire , these settings are switched on . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole image size lad@@ en@@ quot ; should you only use on fast computers . if you have one then you can get better results .
by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the toolbar if you use image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in image processing , this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling , it is meant that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for more detailed explanation .
with the PNG @-@ compression setting , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality since PNG requires a loss@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression .
with the option to comp@@ ress TIFF files , you can de@@ activate the default compression algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it does not affect the image quality since the default algorithm works without loss .
with the loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 file , you can save losses @-@ free . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG . as this paragraph is written , metadata has not yet been supported , but was in the planning .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ code ; image editing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it is rapidly becoming a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the image editing settings .
the default acceptance is that all green pixels are the same . if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels with odd lines , this difference generates a lat@@ tice pattern in the output . if you use this option , solve this problem with minimal loss of details . this option draws the image a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 lat@@ tice pattern with the V@@ NG@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the Automatic color balance is used .
this setting is used only if the white balance is not set . default is to use a solid color balance based on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensor has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the default it is the pointed @-@ off lights , so the parts of your images that are burned down due to the inability of your camera to look at the pointed @-@ lights , as a rus@@ hing white . the setting colors will solve some unusual results , as they display the pointed @-@ lights in various ros@@ at@@ os . finally , you can try some parts of missing information from the nick@@ names to re@@ construct .
this is possible because blue pixels generally do not satur@@ ate as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam ; and d@@ cra@@ w try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the still un@@ saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want .
if you select the Rec@@ on@@ struc@@ ting option , you get the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can / should therefore be adjusted for each picture individually .
set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than standard 1 . this can also be done later in the Edit &amp; Edit image options . to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the partial raw data that many cameras have and which provide a matrix of coloured pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour design .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; and D@@ cra@@ w present you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like this . as if A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ ic Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for gra@@ dient correction since you are done during the raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to restore it . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ code ; information such as the color information from one color space to translate into the others to make the colors as accurate as possible .
behavior Ask if a picture is opened in image processing / Color management module with raw files start .
color Profile folder Sets the folder here , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC where you save all of your profiles . &amp; Edit ; examine these folders then during startup .
settings of the ICC profiles you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
the input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you use . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain color mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma does not correct conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth .
there are other options such as the Soft Pro@@ of Profile that you can em@@ ulate as your image would be returned from one device . this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore work very saturated . this could be manually corrected , rather than rel@@ ying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is quite obvious which color profile is intended for what is intended . unfortunately , not with the models from Canon . therefore , here follows a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course , this answer is in@@ official :
the Canon profile extension makes it possible to recognize the style for the target : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewers and image processing . by delivering this interface , &amp; Edit ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see a list of the available modules . select the ones you want to use and these will then be deleted by &amp; Edit . these modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and you will also find some of them in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the Settings menu under Settings .
for more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can get through the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the sli@@ des@@ how@@ s should be easy to understand . the upper knob adju@@ sts the time between the image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off , which are displayed at the bottom of the pictures during the ad .
the camera characteristics show on the left a list of all currently supported cameras . on the right @-@ hand side there is a button Automatic detection , which attempts to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is properly connected , switched on and in the image display mode . currently , serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage devices are supported .
at the bottom , you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage devices . this field is only active when you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you will need to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / ede on which you mount your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it into the display mode and turn it on .
check whether &amp; Edit ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can choose any name for your camera . it is displayed in the main window menu of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert them all here .
with the confirmation dialog box for moving &gt; images in the tr@@ ash bin , you can specify the conversation of &amp; Edit ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album . del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album , you will find more details .
the editorial changes by the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly accepted by &amp; Edit ; applied when you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise you will need to save the changes using the button modifications .
you can also display the welcome screen of &amp; Edit ; disable when starting . this acceler@@ ates under certain circumstances the start process of &amp; Edit ; .
the setting Bei@@ m start searching for new photos forces &amp; digi@@ plug ; search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ plug ; . if something was deleted from the base folder , &amp; Edit asks &amp; Edit ; you if it should delete them from the database .
various color schemes can be Edit &amp; Edit to customize the main window to suit your taste . you can select these settings under Settings Design from the toolbar . a preview of the available designs will be listed below :
these designs are defined in plain text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ plug ; to create , you will find more information about this in this tutorial .
&amp; Edit ; includes a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use this to view your photos and for correction and improvement . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selecting the item Display / Edit .
the image processing includes a set of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ code ; therefore , you may not be part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see Set@@ ting up the Image Processing section .
a status bar at the bottom of the window , the file name , current filen@@ ame , magni@@ fication factor , and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the editing functions of image editing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before using file saving or the Save button from the toolbar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo as soon as you have saved the image .
so you should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it . you can do this with File Save as .
as long as you haven &apos;t saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using File Recovery or button Rec@@ over the image editing button in the toolbar . you then lose any change you &apos;ve done on the photo since the last save .
virtually any image editing action can be und@@ one or restored . the last action can be und@@ one by choosing Edit back or restore by choosing Edit Rec@@ over from the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should use the keyboard short@@ cuts , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to und@@ o and remember C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the button or restore button in the toolbar for a moment , you will get a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in @-@ between will also be und@@ one or restored .
once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar , image high , picture or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them .
you can enter the photo and zoom out by using C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the view menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar :
view Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you come to the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . if you do not want this , you can change this in the Edit Settings dialog . you can view this from Edit &amp; Edit ; main window . see the section for setting up image editing .
if you want to print the current image , you can print in the File Image menu and get the standard &amp; node ; Print dialog . you can customize the settings before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual images or whole sentences . entire image preview pages can be printed from your selection . you just have to select the pictures with the standard methods and select from the menu album Export printer wizard . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; Edit Pan@@ e ; main window has a side@@ bar on the right , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation file , also in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five tabs is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicking on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear into the edge .
the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied to EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are converted . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label field in other applications , you should consider these limitations .
after you have commented , use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then saved .
with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this is always performed if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the pictures .
the rating shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images simultaneously , select them and use the context menu .
the rating is written to the IP@@ TC field in gency . the code follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword overview shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the keyword used previously in this &amp; Edit ; session .
the keyword Tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can quickly limit the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom of the page is a further relief when entering keywords for a series of images . if you have typ@@ ed different keywords , they are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree . keyword sub@@ s all key words of an image .
if multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this is only applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection , if you want to provide a selection with a keyword , please refer to the Key@@ word filter section .
the keyword filter side@@ bar is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side bar is used with their album , date , keyword and search views . if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also draw and drop tags . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and place it on the selection . then a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword .
in the upper example , the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day . the keyword filter refers to no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected using C@@ trl + a , and then a keyword is drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks whether this keyword should be set .
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be turned off under Settings Di@@ verse .
if you have a rule with and created a rule and notice that it should be one or more , you can easily change this by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry in which the database is searched for . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string already set in the database .
you can , for example , specify an Advanced search across all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button group@@ ing . the options then look like this :
why have Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web and Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? free space is limited to 1 GB and you won &apos;t want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I &apos;ve mainly adapted it to &amp; Edit ; s specific implementation .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is the color that comes from your camera or scanner that have a predictable deviation from the actually photograph@@ ed or scanned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can reach that the colors on your screen resem@@ ble those of your camera or scanner and that correspond to the colors you print or publish on the web to those of your digital dark@@ room .
when the subject comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of the image processing work@@ flows . additionally , links with deeper information allow you to make your own informed decisions so that you get the desired result .
if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you do not have to worry about color management .
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
your only other image expenses are by email or the web where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB functions so well and makes life so easy for all , why should one use a different color space and have to worry about color management ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ Dimen@@ sion@@ ale representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger colour spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and first click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to check my monitor when I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB color space ?
yes ! whether you are working in the s@@ RGB colour space or not , you have to be alli@@ g@@ ating your monitor because s@@ RGB assumes that your ; on@@ it@@ or is alli@@ br@@ ated to s@@ RGB . if you work than in s@@ RGB color space then you must either channel your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic corrections , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual editing .
the functions norm@@ alize , match , automatic balance and contrast expand from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ ting Automatic correction try automatically from your colors to make the best . you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the brightness values over the entire image so that the dark@@ est point is black and the brigh@@ test point as brigh@@ tly as possible without changing its color sh@@ ading . this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or cris@@ p .
balance : this method adju@@ sts the intensity factor of the color of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible . sometimes the comparison achieves very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it also produces rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation , which either causes wonders or destro@@ ys it .
automatic balancing : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and light border tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range .
intensi@@ fy contrast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a new ji@@ b of all values in between . this is only visible in selected images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ plug ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is slightly restricted since one color space is worked with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you can thus be too far from the original picture , areas with over@@ exposure may occur . if you can do the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is copy@@ righ@@ ted by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it using the menu entry Color white balance of image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left , both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen . the preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance then it is enough to click on the sub@@ window .
the image preview features a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
the hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well @-@ lit pictures , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your score depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow adjustments lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or also dim them down .
to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color for calcul@@ ating the color temperature of the white balance . in this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of preferences . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will get the combined result displayed in the white balance . this will appear in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save As and Load buttons do exactly this . any setting of the white balance you have set allows you to save it to a text file and load it later .
the default settings return all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that neutral settings will also result in a different photo than your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed .
you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit encoding is better suited for high quality images . however , this coding requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for the formats of PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF , and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color mapping can be done by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed instructions for using color profiles can be consul@@ ted in the chapter color management .
another important tool is to find color correction in the menu . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time , so that you can use it for several photos at the same time . this is useful if your camera or scanner always needs the same error and you always need the same correction .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
this &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool color effects provide you with four color effects , a solar installation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a can@@ ister filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect if one replaced a partially developed print with a short flash light and then completed the development of the image . this had the effect that the lighter areas dark@@ er and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illumination . the result was a partial neg@@ ativity of the image . this tool allows you to fine tune this interesting effect .
the intensity controls the solar system . at about 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . another up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment creates a negative image so that it is not possible to generate photographic paper .
this is an example of the solar installation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ a@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it simple , it em@@ belli@@ sh@@ es many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and hence a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photos . you can try to experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your adjustments can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result , use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you make a photo in poor light conditions , you can get the opposite problem : one too high satur@@ ation . also in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation instead of raising it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple contrast ratio / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool is based on tone correction for the improvement of exposure . even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated , you only need the area of the slide for the application purpose described here .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph , three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked in and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the controller and make sure the picture changes .
on the right side , the original and the preview of the image can be viewed . the preview is updated dynamically , based on the settings of the image , updated . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : this selection box shows whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed using a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear representation is often the most useful . if images contain large areas of a constant color , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic classification is more useful .
three controls : the upper one for the dark tones , the middle one for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma values .
the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows , middle and bright tones . furthermore , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controls that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as with the input values . for example , the compression of the output values can be used to create a light picture as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and Load : with these buttons , the set values can be saved in the file system and loaded later . to do this , the Gim@@ p Levels Format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows , means , and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the Over@@ lay In@@ dic@@ ator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , that means you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result .
below is an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
on the left side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modi@@ fier channel : this selection box allows the channel to be specified by the module :
beside this box are two symbols to change between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for images taken with a digital camera is mostly the linear mode of the most useful . for images with large areas of constant color , linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case , log@@ arith@@ mic mode continues .
for example , if you move a short part to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones correspond to dark@@ er output tones and that the corresponding pixels become dark@@ er .
when you move this marker to the area you want to change , a suitable line is displayed on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and Load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . any curve you have created can be stored in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
if you use this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes button , automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , mid@@ - and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the Over@@ lay In@@ dic@@ ator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels are found , the combined result is displayed . this is an indicator , i.e. you only get the effect displayed in the preview and it is not possible to see the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and corrected ( 2 ) .
the Edit &amp; Edit channel mixer ; image processing is a tool to improve color channels or change the color shades of the photo .
the Chann@@ els Mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the color tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu color channel mixer of image editing .
with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left part of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the picture , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram will display the corresponding color value .
controls for the module are right down : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you turn lumin@@ ance , the image will also retain the general brightness as the channel mixer is then THE tool for generating great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ rome , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colour space . the color space consists of small noise @-@ art@@ ef@@ acts that don &apos;t appear in the same spot in the color channel and whose noise pattern looks different in each channel . if this is the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rome conversion by reducing the color space first .
the Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any bl@@ ender setting you can save for later and then load . the file format used is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the Over@@ lay In@@ dic@@ ator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , that means you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a picture in which the Blue channel has been read@@ ju@@ sted . the option L@@ umin@@ ance is enabled . the original image can be seen in ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your ability to abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step because colour images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .
Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3@@ 200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford Consulting 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super
green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green l@@ enti@@ l filter . this looks good , with all scene images and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with orange lens filters . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simulate mo@@ on@@ light scenes at daylight time . thus , similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : generates warm light and medium tones while adding a bit of cold in the sh@@ ading tones . this is very similar to the process of staying a pressure and re@@ development in a s@@ epi@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) s@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with Edit &amp; Edit ; tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a screen , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper texture effect is applied in the picture below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the modified under ( 2 ) can be seen . the relief parameter has been set to 200 .
with Edit &amp; Edit ; tool frame add a decorative frame to be added to a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the confin@@ es of a photo is not an easy task . one possibility to keep his attention is to set the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye .
type : with this parameter you enter the desired frame type for your picture . throughout the picture borders with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce borders it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , bent around it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame that is ideal for a button effect and decorative inserts a decorative frame with patterns .
width : specifies the width of the frame in percent . the range of values for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for the printing of the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio beforehand .
with this handy tool , you can insert simple a format@@ ted text into a picture at any place . this also goes in several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
each setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the &quot; OK &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
using the &amp; Edit ; tool templates you can put a template over a picture .
the menu Image Tem@@ plates apply in image editing can be used to lay sten@@ cils over a picture .
for the template there are no restrictions regarding size and orientation . however , you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to minimize the file size of the template . if you want to add your template to &amp; Edit , simply send an email in englisch to the &amp; digi@@ kam ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ code @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to put your sten@@ cil folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder where you copied the sten@@ cil files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cil folder . selecting a folder automatically updates the template of the templates .
the preview contains three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the picture below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
smaller : this knob decreases the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to shrink the image accordingly .
move : use this button to move the image below the template . to do so , take the picture and place it in the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be automatically adjusted to the preview size .
&amp; Edit ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but generates gra@@ iny images , especially in dark areas .
blur@@ ry mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per . in fact , it sharp@@ ens no bit , it works rather psycho@@ visual . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ righ@@ ted by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for custom@@ ization .
images without focus as well as most digit@@ alized images need a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because the dig@@ itali@@ zation process is composed of only minimal differences to a color point . this in turn results in sharp edges becoming blur@@ red . the same phenomenon can be observed when ink points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras usually need more subsequently than normal cameras for private users .
in JPEG images , a camera is often used for internal sharpen@@ ing . in contrast , images in the raw format must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some scann@@ ers apply a field of sharp@@ ness while reading the image . if you disable them , you will get control of your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing tool . you can invo@@ ke this with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ t sharpen@@ ing .
you should be careful with this , as the results do not work very naturally : sharpen@@ ing increases sharp@@ ness of edges , but also increases the noise . in general , the most useful technique to shar@@ pen an image will re@@ focus the tool . you can re@@ focus more information and a comparison of all techniques to sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than sharpen@@ ing it . use the tool for sof@@ tening with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ t sof@@ tness and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ known mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove eils from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview help to edit the image . the preview window will display the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should be tried first . an increase in the radius or the amount will ampli@@ fy the effect . if you make the bl@@ ur mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ates in the vicinity of sharp edges will produce .
the radius shows how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , you should shar@@ pen pictures best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image one that is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference @-@ amount . thus , it is possible to define a minimum difference thus for an edge of the filter . thus areas with a soft change between tones are exemp@@ t from shar@@ pen and hence , beauty bugs in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of the extremely blur@@ red mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image that ( 2 ) . blur@@ red mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focused a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ righ@@ ted ent@@ f@@ alt@@ ungs @-@ filter algorithm of Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Viennese filtering . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Viennese filtering . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing pictures usually achieves better results than blur@@ red . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing colors in image editing .
in practice , the circular folding works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche fold . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche fold has a very long tail , which causes the mathematical result also depends on the source pix@@ el@@ xes which are far from original pixels . the fin &apos;s fin is influenced in most cases even very strongly from the distant pixels .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value 1 should result in good results .
correlation : an increase of the correlation may help reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation may be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ ness effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help to reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 are only rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad . a usable value is 0.@@ 03 .
G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your sharp@@ ness Gau@@ ß is sch . in most cases you should let this value be set to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a value non@@ zero otherwise you may need to increase the correlation and / or noise filter .
die size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase of the die size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the gauge &apos;s sharp@@ ness . note however that the module will be very slow if you select large values for this parameter . in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to change all the blan@@ ks , color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible , but which later leave unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts .
if you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
in general , weed masks produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by the blur@@ red mas@@ king using a larger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing .
even under optimal conditions it is never possible to remove the effect of blur@@ ring . for the Viennese filter one can show that it is the optimal Lin@@ e@@ are filter . practically , the result of the FI@@ R Viennese filter is always at least as good as the bl@@ ur mask . the FI@@ R Viennese filter is often better when machining small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small un@@ focused image :
the original un@@ sharp color picture that needs to be corrected . this picture was made with an analog camera . the un@@ focuss@@ ed result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for further information on the correction data in digital pictures you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the sli@@ der controls the blur@@ ring of the area of the dark@@ ened area in order to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the ink ink allows a matching colour for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , you can adjust it here .
the image error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
this tool contains various default settings as starting points to simplify the restoration process . the available default settings are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the tab smo@@ othing and advanced settings .
attention p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to an even smo@@ othing over the picture . a value of 0.@@ 9 should keep details in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary afterwards .
directional dependence alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions , while a value draws close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a movie gran@@ ul@@ arity or CCD h@@ iss will produce a high value wave @-@ like patterns . JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 .
fl@@ atten &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smo@@ othing factor above all@@ el@@ . p then defines the relative smo@@ othing . therefore , place this value corresponding to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary when very much noise is present , as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is going through . usually 1 or 2 is enough .
angle step width da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is selected small , it should also be selected small . make sure that small angles create a long runtime . therefore , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral stri@@ de width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel @-@ smo@@ othing and never greater than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the amount of quality you receive by selecting this option is only minor . it doubles the runtime . we therefore recommend that you let it out .
the Save As and Load buttons do exactly this . any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
correc@@ ting image errors is relatively very fast at work . however , it can take very long time and draw a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time by pressing the Cancel button .
below you can see how image errors can be removed with Small art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is applied in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see , there is a strange black arti@@ fact that was caused by a poor movie deposit during the trip . the original picture is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise noise . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts that come from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or mos@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scanned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window of advanced settings can remain with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time that the filter per pixel needs and can bl@@ ur the image . the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and thus smaller faults .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel spac@@ ing the filter to the front to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter will not be able to get picture details anymore and noise or lubrication will occur again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong cannot be removed all the noise or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak h@@ iss or JPEG @-@ art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend either to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend either to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process that is controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the chro@@ mat@@ ing tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark@@ er areas , which are typically more distorted .
damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of the phase damp@@ ing . this value defines how quickly the adaptive filtering radius respon@@ ds to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is raised , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high . if it is at its minimum , noise and phase j@@ itter can occur at edges . it can remove spi@@ kes and is the recommended method for it .
save and load : these buttons are used exactly for this purpose . all the noise reduction parameters you set can be stored in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and corrected with ( 2 ) . noise reduction has been applied using standard settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a little sof@@ tly is fortunately much easier to shar@@ pen than a picture . use tool for sof@@ tening with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ur sof@@ tness and experiment with the smooth@@ ness . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; Edit ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film scores , scratches , compres@@ sion@@ art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that occur in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images .
the same algorithm can be used for color and texture creation . the texture creation is performed using a different tool , the image error correction . the algorithm for the restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away from it . as a loss @-@ prone comp@@ action algorithm , it generates some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ac@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in the un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the Save As and Load buttons do exactly this . any setting of photo restoration can be saved to a text file and loaded later .
photo @-@ restoration is relatively very fast at work . however , it can take very long time and draw a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time by pressing the button termin@@ ating .
below you can restore as a photo with uni@@ formity noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film grain on the faces . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of photo restor@@ ations . this time tex@@ tures were reduced to an old colour photo that was read with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts that were caused by scanner illumination and photo paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool Hot@@ spot allows to remove Hot@@ pixel of photos that were taken with a CCD camera , eight were removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project which are copy@@ righ@@ ted by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw mode photographs , as many cameras with JPEG compression feature a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels quot ; and quot ; bright pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark @-@ picture sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
load this file into the wizard with the button dark . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the matching dark image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wizard will remember the final dark and automatically re@@ charges it at the next session .
the image area and the preview help to correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all preview ranges .
select an area to view the defective pixels from the preview and the filter results . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixels . these are the filters available :
average : an average of the neighboring pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the default fil@@ ter@@ method . all pixels with a gap of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to compu@@ te a bi @-@ quad@@ ratic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square turns ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to compu@@ te a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic turns ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ spot correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been magni@@ fied to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zing ; vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image .
wide angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , can frequently illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting &amp; quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . telep@@ hot@@ o lenses also show this behavior .
many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter , which may increase the necessary sh@@ utter speed under certain circumstances so that it is impossible to hold the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an aperture of f / 16 or smaller since otherwise un@@ shar@@ per effects are caused by movement .
with the large expos@@ ures of today &apos;s fil@@ mic and gra@@ y@@ scale depth of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers , it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image created without this filter . the tool vig@@ net@@ ting correction applies the transformation with a center filter onto a picture . the algorithm is copy@@ righ@@ ted by John Walker .
with three controls , you can control the vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three further expos@@ ures of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the largest density of the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which compens@@ ates for an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly a light intensity of 2 . increase the density to compensate for a larger degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it by a small degree .
lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the lumin@@ ous intensity of the pixels . you must adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide you with positive values , since you only have to increase the settings .
if you want a fin@@ er read@@ ju@@ st@@ ment of the exposure of the target image , leave the values for lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / G@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the Edit menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the vig@@ net@@ ting correction applied to one image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image .
the &amp; Edit ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geomet@@ rical distor@@ tions . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree treats the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or conve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s at edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of fourth gra@@ dient adju@@ sts the distant corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ rical distortion can be eliminated almost .
in general : this value controls the thickness of the distortion second degree . negative values can be used to correct t@@ onal distor@@ tions and positive values of the cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth degree . this value works more strongly against the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses the &apos; Corner Par@@ ameters &apos; has the inver@@ ted character of the parameter General .
zoom : this value res@@ ets the image size and thereby performs a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive the image res@@ ins .
bright : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase them .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialogue with a preview illustrates the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start .
the ho@@ ver@@ - or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes . best perform this correction as the first one . if you want to re @-@ cut a picture and then perform a t@@ onal correction , the effect would seem obvious to the fal@@ con .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal auxiliary line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to display the dotted lines . move it into an important location , such as the sea edge or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove this with the cutting tool in the menu transformation trim from image editing or via the zoom sli@@ der of this dialog .
the next logical step for some motives , e.g. shots from the front , frame and picture , is the perspective to correct which all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera by hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the t@@ onal correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ating the infr@@ a @-@ red film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infrared movie , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview , you can set two parameters to set film scores and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the Add Film Con@@ sole option if you want to simulate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regulator changes the amount of film grains and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white like snow !
since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a kind of au@@ ra in the top lights .
this is known from classic high speed rollers such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , manufacturers mix large silver grains of photographic emul@@ sion .
the film grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to post@@ p@@ one into the past . the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere of everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographer , gra@@ iny view especially in your mon@@ och@@ rome photos , you need to use this filter .
the regulator can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is set to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 , although higher values are often required . if you need more grains , you can apply the filter repeatedly .
this is an example of the film grain effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that edited the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity is ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ code ; filter oil painting generates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature images and style life are good for this effect .
there are two controls to influence this effect . the upper one sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better suited for large images .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the editor is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixels large picture is 1 and smo@@ othing 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ code ; Filter cab@@ le@@ drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a cab@@ bage roll . the lines whose gra@@ dients vary slowly are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sket@@ ch@@ .@@ This would be good pictures to begin with .
there are two kno@@ bs with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower knob adju@@ sts the contrast ( smooth@@ ness ) .
this is an example of the char@@ coal filter filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ code ; Filter engraving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Filter engraving is a fast tool to give your pictures again with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important in content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ strous landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave @-@ blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and make it look as if it is looked through glass blocks .
wave @-@ blocks 2 : analog@@ ous to the wave @-@ blocks 1 , the picture is distorted here with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects take long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the button exit .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of bl@@ ur effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image along star shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a zo@@ oming camera and thereby creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radial blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by turning the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
correction : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to step back into the background .
blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : photograph@@ ing from a car or train , camera .
blur@@ ring blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image soft into the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ am@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle light .
sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image by random@@ ly shifting the pixels and thereby simul@@ ating the blur@@ ring of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur : finds the color bas@@ ins in the picture and blur@@ red them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : spl@@ its the photo into rectangular cells and then recre@@ ates it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects take long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can cancel this calculation at any time by pressing the button termin@@ ating .
the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops on your picture . this gives it natural to your pictures a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of drops . since the drop@@ let size does not grow automatically with the size of the image , it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops .
you can use Edit &amp; Edit ; edit an area free of rain@@ drops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter rain@@ drops , the area will remain free of rain@@ drops .
this is an example of the rain@@ drop filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the edited image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can place it through mirrors or turning in the correct orientation . you can find the tools for this in the menu transform@@ ations or transforming mirrors .
photo flash is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of resolution are reached ? how can you recover the missing information here or guess ? the C@@ TR@@ L algorithm used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose to change size change in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is shown below .
the size change tool uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality then try the tool to blow up .
many image processing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to increase an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm picture bubbles was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
you have to tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the New size tab and are listed below :
maintain aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary when very much noise is present , as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gog@@ h &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
the Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . each installation for photo magni@@ fication can be saved as text file and loaded later .
photo infl@@ ating is very fast with what it does , but it can take very long time and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time by pressing the button termin@@ ating .
you can see below an example of photo infl@@ ating by enlar@@ ging a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard magni@@ fication for comparison .
cro@@ pping a photo is not only a frequently performed surgery , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together a picture . to crop a photo you simply need to create the rectangle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag@@ ging the rectangle . you will see this rectangle while you move the mouse .
when you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut off . this will give you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cli@@ pped by drag@@ ging on the corners of the rectangle . a new rectangle will create by simply drag@@ ging it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The edit button for image editing in the toolbar and the photo is cut ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the file saving or file saving in the File menu to save the newly cut picture .
in the preview section , you can change the size of the rectangle by drag@@ ging the corners using the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog will be preserved .
according to the aspect ratio , you can specify orientation as portrait or landscape format . in portrait aspect , the greater value of the height and cross @-@ format width is always assigned .
cutting the tool after aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches , inches or any other physical size . you can e.g. see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and its aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically .
in the bottom of the dialog you can use the Max relationship button to set the area to cut to the greatest possible depending on chosen ratio and orientation .
the Adju@@ st@@ ment tool stores its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horizon@@ tal or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the editing tool next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cut image and not the original image .
the settings of the assembly assistance make it possible to blend help to make your pictures better . these help are :
harmonious Tri@@ angle : harmonic divi@@ des are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ rule , harmonic tri@@ angles are a way of dividing a rectangle in similar harmonic tri@@ angles on the diag@@ on@@ als .
golden middle : the golden middle is a division that is based on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things we feel as beautiful .
the golden pitch is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks used to construct your temples and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put together your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious .
the golden center provides liqu@@ e@@ fied auxiliary lines when you compose a picture . these aids are listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ al will bring you good results for your photos . compared to third @-@ level gels , the golden spiral generates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this kind of composition carries the viewer &apos;s gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a sym@@ metric visual flow in this way .
a further rule is the rectang@@ les of the golden spiral , also called golden rectang@@ les . this rectang@@ les should be used to create the golden spiral . this can be a line or different objects .
the Golden Tri@@ angles also derive from the golden spiral discussed above . your verti@@ ces are the center points of the sides of the golden rectang@@ les . note that in contrast to harmonic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not even triangle tri@@ angles .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect called Dynamic Sym@@ met@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise .
the options Horizon@@ tal mirror and vertical mirr@@ oring can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions .
with the Color button you can set the color of the relief lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the guides can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
if you make a photo then it easily happens that you don &apos;t hold the camera vertical or horizontal . this creates a picture where things are rot@@ ated around an angle . you can do this using the Edit &amp; Edit free rotation and adjust the finish angle .
rotate your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this slide are indicated in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button you can set the sli@@ der to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are displayed on the top right .
for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the picture , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after you have shot a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix this is to use the function transformation trim from image processing .
an elegant way to trim the image is Automati@@ cally trim the function . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the image a bit after the turn . note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tival transform@@ ations are performed by a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will be automatically rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty spaces created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty spaces created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle to the top left : indicates the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area .
corner right top : indicates the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle at the bottom left : indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
corner right down : indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image is slightly s@@ me@@ ared . for a single adjustment , this effect is small , but two adjustments generate a dou@@ bly so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adjusted the perspective , you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to clean this is to cut the picture with transformation trim from the image processing .
the sh@@ ear@@ ing tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part to the opposite . a horizontal shift , for example , will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left . in other words , a rectangle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module via transform@@ ations .
shoot your image by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles are reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview pane .
to your help , a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed . move the mouse to an important point , like the sea , a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the sh@@ ear@@ ing tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture is wi@@ ped a bit . for a single sh@@ ear@@ ing , this effect is mostly negli@@ gible , but two sh@@ ad@@ ings generating twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after sh@@ ear@@ ing the picture has im@@ print tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transformation trim from the image processing .
&amp; Edit ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were compiled . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of formats with &amp; Edit .
due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF among them .
&amp; Edit ; displays only files in formats that you know . this happens on the basis of the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , you can modify this list of file extensions and Edit them . in the configuration section , you will find more information about this .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to use . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; Edit ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression procedures to digital images . thereby , redundant information is reduced to save image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also store loss@@ less if specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read from Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful guides in English . you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter by &amp; Edit . in the configuration section , you will find more information about using modules with &amp; digi@@ plug ; .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the loading of raw images only with the d@@ cra@@ w program , which is included in &amp; Edit ; here are supported over 200 raw file formats . all supported cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats that &amp; digi@@ code ; supported :
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam ; does not understand these formats and therefore has no built @-@ in options to display or edit movies . if you click on a movie file &amp; Edit ; use settings to play movies to start playback .
go forward to the previously visited album in the Chron@@ ic@@ le . you can only go forward when you have gone back .

if you swa@@ p the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four adjusting entries with the white balance module .
many tools you need to edit photo editing are in &amp; Edit ; included . your description follows here .
all image editing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , m@@ oll@@ us@@ cs , noise suppression , re@@ focus , blur@@ red mas@@ king , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture user quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter to the current image . to the left of it , five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
the left part shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected area .
the upper part shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected area .
the left part shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper part shows the original and the lower part to compare the effect of the filter .
mouse over &apos; Style : displays the preview when the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over@@ exposure and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general preferences page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to view the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module will be noted .
the page bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble miniature program . you can move in or out with the mouse wheel or hold it . move it while you press the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this of course pres@@ upp@@ oses that your images contain ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and to select and nam@@ ing colors .
the pal@@ ettes that can be installed by &amp; k@@ de can be valid for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color and last used colors .
in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of the installed trays or browse the folders for files .
the cursor is displayed in the palette view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it indicates the color beside it . the color is described under the Pal@@ let View . here , the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used for selecting . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box Bei@@ m C@@ ursor is activated under the button color , the color is inserted from the color table at the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write is selected . this mode you can set by selecting the check box over@@ write under Bei@@ m C@@ ursor .
a selection that was created as described in the last section can be used together with the copying , cutting and paste actions .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line sign if another color follows .
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be drag@@ ged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color selection on the left side .
&amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a K@@ DE program used to view &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graph@@ s . graph@@ s are used in science , especially in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graph@@ s . the programs that &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; includes are according to the program author out@@ dated &amp; X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with just a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ Gra@@ viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ dot ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; displays graph@@ s with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; k@@ ate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; re @-@ calculated the graph and represented in &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; )
menu to open the graph@@ s in &amp; k@@ ate ; to open or open the graph@@ ene in &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; in a &amp; k@@ ate ; component
loading large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems starting from about 1000 nodes and a h@@ ack to represent more than these nodes )
further needed software : &amp; k@@ Gra@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of the graph pres@@ upp@@ os@@ ed .
the main window displays the opened graph@@ s , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; without starting a argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot . in this case , the toolbar only contains the symbol file and the ( empty ) list Last opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the bottom screen shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the diagram is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( up and down without special keys , left and right at pressed &amp; Alt ; button ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the currently loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph should be rel@@ o@@ aded or if you want to ignore the change . if you want to change your decision later , you can change the menu item Settings k@@ screen viewer ; set it up , see also .
if you open a Gra@@ ph file outside a running &amp; c@@ Graph@@ viewer instance , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; or to display the graph to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but change it later with the setup dialog .
when starting the program , you can re@@ open all the graph@@ s of your last session . again , you can save your choice as well as change it later .
you can also specify how the graph should be split across multiple pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be selected freely .
if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page will be adjusted to this page . this ignor@@ es the aspect ratio . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph .
page preview with a graph@@ s distributed across multiple pages without header and with another font
the Er@@ ne@@ ut Load page gives the possibility to specify the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can specify a default behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or ask the program every time .
the Open page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; specify when a graph is opened out of a current session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that every time it is requested .
the session management page gives the possibility to specify the start behavior of &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( opening or not ) the files of the last session ( or not ) to be asked at each start .
the context menu , which normally appears at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; appears , opens up more possibilities :
here you can choose among various &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are :
the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overl@@ aps as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the default for un@@ coated graph@@ s . it produces represent@@ ations according to the spr@@ ing@@ spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is equivalent to statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP algorithm creates a spr@@ ing@@ spring model for ung@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s . it uses the Fru@@ str@@ e @-@ Rein@@ gold he@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ grid trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ s .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the nodes in a circular manner according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ cal structures .
opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which is then executed from a shell . the command should accept the graph file as a parameter , and output the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in the x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can give &amp; eg ; algorithms , or even modify the graph with a filter before it is drawn .

the K@@ IP@@ I module displays images and provides tools to read and store new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner supported by the San@@ e project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . to do this , you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
when you open the File menu item , a dialog appears , which lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select here the source from which you want to pick the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by replacing the default values duc@@ r@@ he own to select your image . view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you start scanning the image . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right lower corner . see the K@@ oo@@ ka manual for more information .
make sure the window is completely displayed as some settings may not be displayed otherwise .
after you have pressed the Scan button you have to wait until the scan is complete and the window to set the image file options appears . please remember that the BM@@ P type does not comp@@ ress and therefore creates very large files . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create by saving the image .
screen@@ shots can be created after you have selected in the Import &gt; Screen Photo ... menu . a window appears where you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all of your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ space . if you have picked up the complete desktop just read the window under the mouse .
the delay determines how long screen@@ shots are waiting before it starts . if you need to switch to other work@@ tops , you should select this delay highly enough to have the time to navigate there .
after the screen@@ shot was taken , the Options dialog appears with the options described above .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data are stored in the EX@@ IF key words of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization provides tools to locate images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , long@@ itude and l@@ atitude are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as XML file in the g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can bring together a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog appears then . to load a possible correlation about time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . this file of course contains data that were recorded at the same time in the same locations as the pictures of your camera .
if the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed which shows the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted with the GMT . this can be done using the time zone . set your camera time zone here .
the setting for the maximum time deviation gives an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time . if the deviation is below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from one location for images , you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all the images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in min. can be used if you have no adequate data . if you know that in reality is a location in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relations for inter@@ pol@@ ating .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a series of photos at the same place . since the dialog box is the coordinates of a call to the next you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . to do so , select the region and enlarge si@@ e.@@ Lead this over and over again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the map can be changed manually between card mode , satellite image and mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to attach the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module image gallery is a tool for ex@@ porting a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages conform to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that you want to export as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to allow the best possible internation@@ alization .
the tab has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted . you only need to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML . the albums are not displayed hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below you will see the alpha preview and the text that appears in the header of the HTML page .
the tab appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . the option for each picture to create a page creates a gallery in which each image also gets its own page . if you then click on a picture , a new page is opened in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer , &amp; eg .
the tab Album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be stored with all your associated images . to do this , select a folder where you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original pictures will also be saved in the new images .
you can change the default color depth with Other color depth . of course , this also affects the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tab preview images allow you to customize some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Cancel to cancel the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . therefore , you can read the program messages to see if errors occurred during the creation . the web browser will automatically start at the end to preview the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool for viewing images .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as turns , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse gest@@ ures . it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , a picture is displayed in full screen mode by default . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less module is a tool to change images without compromising your quality .
this module allows to save images in JPEG format for the actions listed below , without the usual losses in quality or metadata .
the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size is increasing because no compression of the color information takes place . this can also be found in the PNG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client has no documentation right now . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . to do so , select the image that you want to copy to the main program and then call the Import function . this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image , the image to which you want to copy the metadata .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere but not write to any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please check i@@ v2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di Module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG enco@@ ders module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the packages M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck . between the single images you can add a base picture transition . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide show .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
first you have to select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG slideshow . after that you can create the module using Extras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
the images selected by you are then listed under image files in the Portfolio section . there you can also change the sorting of the images or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you need to select the corresponding TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds the one image is displayed . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value creates very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image change .
the background color can be set next . in case of doubt , you should let them black . you can specify the name and path of the created file using the name of the MPEG output file . keep the extension mp@@ g as soon as possible .
if you specify an audio file with the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all the settings to your li@@ king , you can start the production of the movie with the button coding . depending on the speed of your computer you can now quickly or in all cal@@ m@@ ness enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slideshow if you are back .
if a critic appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can customize the paths to the programs of the jp@@ eg@@ tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages using the button Settings right down .
the print wizard allows you to print several images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image image gi@@ mp . this is e.g. useful to improve or print directly to the Gim@@ p module .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in RAW to one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w from Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : expect d@@ cra@@ w not to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first select the raw file that you want to convert and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window will then appear in mode for a single image . with the Pre@@ view button you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now re @-@ adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance . the essential parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue enh@@ anc@@ ers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the file name stays the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tag@@ ged Image Format , TIFF , keeps all the information of your image and uses the loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you plan to edit your images frequently or later otherwise you should not choose the JPEG format because it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ates . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the Ex@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the execute button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Cancel .
batch editing mode allows you to convert different images at one time . therefore , use this mode if you are certain , e.g. by testing on a single image , which is the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write the existing file automatically . this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to re @-@ comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can res@@ ize or enlarge the image .
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option , for example , to adjust your image to the screen size .
non @-@ proportional : dispro@@ portion@@ ate size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
preparation : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can set the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , border size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred email program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent . additional images can drag and drop the images to be sent .
after you have started the module , the image window will be displayed with the images selected by you . you can add more images via the button Add pictures with a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , a preview is displayed on the right .
you can also drag and drop images to the list of images in order to add them to the list of images to be sent .
the Select Res@@ et button removes the selected images from the list of images to be sent .
after selecting all the images , you can open the new message window to your e @-@ mail client using the OK button . you just have to add the addresses and the subject here . the images selected by you are already attached as attachments .
do not forget to send too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations on the size of emails sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration will be saved and used every time you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you will need to specify the right path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments to the images will be added to a text file and the mail attached .
the PNG format from the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats such as TIFF . therefore , you should use PNG when you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG in pictures file format and the original JPEG files are in JPEG format , then the original copy data will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so you can view the status messages in search of bugs . your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end .
after starting the module Advanced Sli@@ deshow , a window with questions like you want to display your slide show appears . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the option Open@@ GL @-@ transitions in the presentation will activate very elegant image transitions by Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the option Show names ensures that the filen@@ ame of the images will be shown in the lower left corner of the presentation .
the loop option causes the presentation to be displayed in an infinite loop . you can then manually cancel it with Es@@ c ; Cancel .
the option images random@@ ly select that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not used the order of the pictures in the album .
the distance between the images can be set between the images . 1500 milli@@ seconds equals 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . so you should check it out before you show the presentation to your friends !
there are over a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly , every transition between the images sel@@ ects a different effect .
during the slide show , you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn on .
with this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slide show .
at the bottom of the bottom of the screen you can see the current filen@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date has no documentation right now . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the user interface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE working surface .
once you have ann@@ ot@@ ated your images and videos , you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; Browse through these , see picture . as you can see by comparing with the image , there are now in every group , i.e. in persons , places and in group keyword records .
in the browser window , you will see the categories for which you have entered information as you have provided your images and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current preview images . in the following , each is described for itself .
if you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
if you select another person , only the pictures are displayed on which both persons are visible . through this selection method you can limit the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few individual pictures .
if you have selected all persons , locations and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area of activity .
in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person storing his own thumb@@ nail , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself .
to view images next to the names , select the button located to the right of the toolbar . in the appearing context menu , you can select which view you need to set for each category separately . this has the advantage that you can display icons with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have suitable images for your keywords ) .
however , you need to determine which image should be displayed for each individual person . to do this , you need to open the image view window ( described in more detail ) and select the image for the corresponding person in the context menu . here you can customize the image for the corresponding person . in the view window , you can customize the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image to be displayed or cut off .
if you enter the search in the main window , a dialog will appear to you , which is very similar to the dialog for setting the picture properties . you can view this dialog in the image again .
if you enter a string in the Text Cap@@ tion or Description field , the cap@@ tions and descriptions of the pictures will be searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can be either a part of the total date , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window you can search all images according to certain names as you can see in the picture . here , pictures on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user manual for &amp; photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but rather want to try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the Homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; photo@@ album ; and select the demo in the first dialog if you start &amp; photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the photo@@ album menu item in the Help menu . after that , some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of the photo@@ album ;
if you would rather like to print this manual , you can find it on the Homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar is shown here : . as the name already says , this bar shows you date statistics on the pictures in your database .
each bar displays another unit . you can switch between units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries Pre@@ view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date will be displayed in the preview ) and the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select an area of the time line by holding the mouse button down and drag@@ ging the mouse over the ruler of the time line , i.e. the time data . if you select an area , only pictures of this period will be displayed in the preview view . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar on the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you with two ways to create html web pages with your images . one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version is described , which you can create via the File HTML menu ...
before creating HTML pages you need to make some adjustments . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and goal . in the following , each area is described more closely .
first , enter the title of the title and a description that the HTML file will contain later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages you will see an example of these settings .
next select if a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file should be created which is to be seen on the overview page . mist@@ y information about the export files can be found in .
last , you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid displaying information that is obvious to the viewer without a description . for example , that all images are from a party . note that all pictures are from a party . therefore , you cannot use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this section you can specify how the HTML pages are supposed to look . most settings are un@@ ambig@@ uous , which is why it is not dealt with specifically .
at the bottom of the page , you can set different resolutions for the images , so those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 do not have to download images that for example have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you set . so it can browse your images with low resolution , which results in a lower transmission time . if you want to get a picture larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting , specify the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
the best way to choose a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first you need to select the main folder in which all your images will be saved . this folder will be saved and added automatically next time . this allows you to specify the location for all future pictures . here you can select either a folder or a protocol supported by K@@ DE , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if these really are all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages have been created will be started . the URL you set here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files you created are not yet in the final destination folder , you must manually copy them to them . in order for the import function , see , properly , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the just described settings have all three related to base folders or URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , the name of which you specify in the output folder .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; photo@@ album ; coming together , you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . however , if you have already spent a lot of time viewing the picture information , people on the pictures , location , etc . then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work will not go once again .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import other ones into your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and im@@ porting .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external ones . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored with in the file or if there is only a link to images in the file . the advantage of saving all images into the file is that you have all the images together and that you can pass this file independently . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the File Export menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are in the .@@ k@@ im file folder . if the corresponding pictures are not found , the images of the URL you specified when you create the HTML files will be searched . this is only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
the following section describes the dialog for ex@@ porting images that you can invo@@ ke via the Export menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available to you :
with the Man@@ ually option to copy to the .@@ k@@ im file , you will need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Automati@@ cally move to the .@@ k@@ im file copied &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth comp@@ ressing the files . if you still like this , simply select the Export File option .
the last option of this page is Maximum image size . if you send images to your friends , you might not want to send the pictures in full size , since the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File Import menu ... select &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described .
the wizard for im@@ porting consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folder the import images are to be copied .
it may be that you person@@ alize the category people of the file to import ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is called persons in your database . therefore , in the third dialog box , you will be asked which categories of the file to import and which categories should correspond in your database .
in the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen in the picture .
it just has to be easy to browse and look at images : if you look at images , you often want to jump inside various picture groups . if you look at images of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will go through the different steps of ( 1 ) Set@@ ting the information about your images , through ( 2 ) the browsing and viewing , to ( 3 ) advanced themes and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program for managing your pictures , but it has been expanded and today your videos will also take care of . in many places in this manual you will talk about pictures , but often this also includes videos with one .
&amp; photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml file in the top folder of your images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup to a program of your choice , such as Nor@@ mal backup tools , to a floppy or re@@ visions in CVS , where they want .
&amp; photo@@ album ; remember the folder where your images are stored and use this in future starts automatically . if you want to read another database in &amp; photo@@ album ; you can start the photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
through the menu entry Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... you get to a window with which you can change the settings of the photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual you will explain the different settings options .
to the left , you can see six different symbols , with which you can view the settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can call by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the desired option .
it describes how to set different properties for each image , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups like objects , animals or albums .
see the dialog used to edit already existing groups . for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol .
sub@@ categories have already been mentioned in the section . in the Options dialog , you can set up complete groups of members , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained in the section .
in the list below you can select the category you want to configure . in the left side of the window is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; spl@@ its its modular system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface .
modules can and will not be described in this manual since they are not part of &amp; photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can call via the module itself .
since the modules are used together by several applications , it may be that the modules have been tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; therefore you should always test new modules first with the demo database before applying them to your own pictures . demo database can be called either via the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu .
the applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , whereby it can be that some modules with &amp; photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage when you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications use their images in albums : this is an album simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this type of order does not support , it simul@@ ates the order for albums for some modules so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ;
this simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album that is simply the current view , so all the pictures that show you the preview currently .
in addition to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have a list of albums . here goes &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the contents of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry in this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you specified in the preferences dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category individuals , you will do &amp; photo@@ album ; so do so if you have selected people to view and pass on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . to do so , start the settings dialog and select the modules to load modules in the module .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start the photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used to by any other K@@ DE application , you can see at the top a menu and toolbar . currently , it does not contain a lot of information , since you have not yet entered information about your images . in the section we will return to this window , but now click on the images to show you an overview of all available images .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to mark any picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons shown on the picture , etc . you can set each image individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . if , for example , on all images Jes@@ per is m@@ apped and all pictures taken in Copenhagen .
all these comments can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these comments if you are using the built @-@ in viewer .
you can see three lists with a text box by specifying persons , locations and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; photo@@ album ; since you will always use them again and again , when you enter information about your images .
the following idea is based on moving the images within the list : if you have for example a family celebration and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are m@@ apped , you can find that the names used are moved upwards , the people find and arrange them faster .
if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the sorting icon after date on the list .
if you have selected comments for each image individually , you may want to edit all the selected images and add comments to these images . in this case , simply click on the above and back buttons that are located under the preview of the image on the top right .
if you have taken several images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Sever@@ al entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . besides , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California .
the picture shows a browser window displaying the USA as an over@@ board . to show you that it is a super@@ group , a special icon will be displayed .
in the Comment dialog context menu it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category . in addition , you can also simply drag one entry to a category and place it in order to sort it into a sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this assumes that you sort your categories alphabe@@ tically . see for it .
you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bars that form the upper edge of the frame . you can also make a separate window from a frame by drag@@ ging it outside the window pane .
if you have adjusted the appearance of the window to your needs , that you are satisfied with the settings , click the Options button ... which offers among other things the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window .
you can also display a frame completely . if you want to see this window again later , use the Options button ... and then hide the window . you can see this process in the picture .
if you select the images in the browser , you get an overview with preview images of the currently selected images , or all images in case you have not set filters . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the size of the thumb@@ nails by simply drag@@ ging the mouse with the middle mouse button .
if you drop an image on the background of your desktop , this image is set as background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , it will be displayed in the image viewer . if you have not opened a window with an image viewer , a new window will be created .
you can also delete images in the preview . simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and press the Remove button or select Del@@ ete from the Edit menu . now the window that you can see in the picture will be displayed .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you with a solution for this problem . you can also use pictures without having you saved on your hard disk . of course you need to have the images stored somewhere so that &amp; photo@@ album ; you can record the photo album ; in the picture you can view the view of &amp; photo@@ album ; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard disk .
pictures in which the right upper corner is cut off are not stored on the hard disk . however , this is present in the pictures 1 @-@ 9 . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , the thumb@@ nails are present so that &amp; photo@@ album ; you can also view these images with the image viewer .
as you can see , this feature requires you to copy and copy files from the folders . &amp; photo@@ album ; does it still not support you to ask for inser@@ ting the CD concerned . so if you want to avoid anno@@ y@@ ance on how to avoid the confusion of your images , please purchase a larger hard drive to store all the images on it .
in the Pictures menu you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name Privacy . if you want a little more privacy , filter the pictures in such a way that at the end those who want to make them in@@ accessible and click the current view in the privacy menu . alternatively , you can control all the images that your little sister may see , control and block the menu entry All except current view .
with this you have determined which pictures should be hidden in the case of the case . if you give your laptop now to your little sister , simply select the menu item to lock images , so all the pictures you have locked will be hidden . if you want to get the pictures again , click on Lock .
it is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the Privacy menu .
please keep in mind that this image protection is by no means very safe . on the one hand , anyone who can access the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only used to forbi@@ d those with &amp; photo@@ album ; not very familiar to forbi@@ d the view to private pictures .
the reason why you want to spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to consider them at some point . for this reason , the photo album has an image _ and video viewer . you can start this from the preview as described in .
you can see the viewer in . of course he shows the picture , but additional all the information you have to enter through the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was made , etc .
if the info@@ box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and place it somewhere else . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information should be displayed at all . all of these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer . the appearing context menu can be seen below .
if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have multiple images loaded in the viewer , you can switch between them before and after by using the image high and image . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run it as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then load a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ trl key and plus or minus .
a very useful feature of the viewer of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete place on the screen . just use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can move in and zo@@ oming in the image . to zoom in , you can zoom out a rectangle with the mouse . with the minus button you can zoom out the plus button zo@@ oms in the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom @-@ rectangle is selected and shows the result of the zoom .
with the dot key you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the same key , zoom into the zoom , so that every pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos are in and out zo@@ oming with the plus and minus key .
the screen@@ shots from the context menu allow you to rotate the image . this does not work for videos . you can make comments to the current image using the menu item ann@@ ot@@ ations from the context menu .
if you view images it can happen that you find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can cancel the view and open configuration dialog of the image to enter these names . however , you may prefer to mark only the picture and see more images .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the images and mark them as good or bad while you view one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to tag images with attributes as you view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter . in the picture you see a picture where the characters A , B and C are set .
once you have placed attributes on your images , you can see them in your browser . so if you want to print , print or whatever you have selected , simply print them all at once with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this is described in . after that you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to make .
categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view . if you display categories in the front view , you can add features to the pictures by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case , you are allowed &amp; photo@@ album ; to paint on the picture .
the restore is not saved with the image , but in the database . in the way you can und@@ o your gem@@ s later .
to enable the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; to turn on , select View on the picture from the context menu . to end the painting press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to use the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not fully profi@@ cient , but the documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understand .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wi@@ re@@ frame views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the object of an object already selected , since all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and either click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the Add menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will pop up so that you can choose the correct position :
you can delete selected objects from the scene by del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button context menu .
if you have changed properties , click Apply to take these changes . if you entered invalid values , a message appears with a fault description . then you can correct the input errors and click Apply again or reject the changes with Cancel .
if you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view .
press Pre@@ view in the property view and a small example of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as a default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example , a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , cross the box locally .
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and thereby change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross will appear in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for moves . you can change the shift by drag@@ ging with the mouse within the entire window .
each object has a stage of visibility as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the parent object or as absolute value . objects are only displayed when selected , or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility stage chosen in the toolbar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it as desired . you can also save several window orders and simply switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window above or below a view , drag the user to the top or bottom of a view . a rectangle will then display the new position .
to create a new column , drag the user to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anch@@ ored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other , drag the amateur in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the tabs on top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to solve a view from the anch@@ or@@ age , drag the user on the desktop or click the small arrow pointing to the left at the beginning bar .
to close a view click on the small cross in the beginning bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can add additional views into the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any place .
the current window view can be saved with View window order ... saving it . a dialog appears where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to render , this program has to be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene , click the Ren@@ dering icon The icon Ren@@ dering in the toolbar or select the menu item View scene render .
a render mode corresponds to entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many render modes , from a quick preview to full pictures of the highest quality .
if you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or in the View Mode menu ... select the following dialog :
each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense , but it makes sense to recognise the features of the mode .
in the Size Guide Size , you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the picture , select the check box sub@@ section and enter the image section to render into the input fields .
in the quality combination field , you can select the properties that &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use reflection lighting . a detailed description of render features can be found in the User Manual &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with only one ray per pixel , various errors can occur . these images often have a mo@@ ir@@ é pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . generally , images look better with this property .
if you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calculate and connect &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than a ray per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as a standard , an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tively because the super @-@ sampling the neighboring pixels are included . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is further divided and adap@@ tively because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a ray per pixel . if the difference between pixels exceeds the given threshold , then both pixels are processed by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel .
diff = abs ( R 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the predefined threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels that are followed individually and for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the ray process called J@@ it@@ tering . when you turn on J@@ it@@ tering , changes &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; it calcul@@ ates diff@@ use light reflection . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can specify whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated beams have not hit the object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly terminated , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; scene , select the menu entry file Import ... and select a file in the dialog box .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the full command sum of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; . if error messages or warnings appear when im@@ porting , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not want to support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import , write this source text between the two particular comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this adds the source code of the object to the opened text file in the editor . simply select the source code in the editor and drag it to the object tree .
copy and paste to &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can add source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene rendered . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on the help in the property view , open and k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; User documentation to the displayed object . set the path to your document retention and version here . supported are versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. altitude field data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for the display of the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates .
you can set the object capture of the d@@ ots to the grid in the context menu of the wire @-@ model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the detail level separately for two directions .
if you tick high attention to detail for enhanced projections , all wire @-@ model views are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions from the perspective and the vertical projections . this feature gives a better approxim@@ ation to projections , but requires more time to render .
if you tick the wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is represented in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you tick the floor , a bottom is rendered below the objects . the bottom is represented in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors .
if you tick the edge smo@@ othing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value . more exact details about the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender modes section .
on this page , you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the Window System section it will explain how to create and save window orders .
the combination panel Standard window arrangement : shows all existing window configurations . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
the list of existing window orders shows all existing window orders . a new arrangement allows you to create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected layout by removing the button .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement . you can create new views using the Add button and delete selected views using the Remove button .
the position of the new window . with New column you create a new column on the right side of the existing windows , with Un@@ ten anchor the window under the existing window , with map board you get a map view together with the previous view and flo@@ ats the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more detailed knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on one level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only get a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied to rendering , as a result you get a black picture .
if you do not insert light sources , your entire scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture .
if you have installed everything correctly , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following default window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of the toolbar . please read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols often , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu item Edit Del@@ ete . so you now have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera views the whole scene you are creating . in particular note that in the fourth wire model view ( right down ) . this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of the ren@@ der@@ ation of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the content of the view object properties in which you can find the different parameters of the camera . in the user documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; see for more details .
change nothing to the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera has control points that you can change the target point of the camera . just click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location .
if you press the Apply button or enter the Enter key , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . you could , for example , insert a header ( insert infinite body tor@@ so ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method of solving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually provides a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as floor :
a good advice : select the layer in the object tree , change the name and then press the Apply button or enter the Enter key . in the object tree , the new name is displayed immediately .
the wi@@ re@@ frame view now also indicates the level , al@@ beit at the moment only as a fin@@ ite fin@@ ite level . if you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon .
if you look closely at the object tree , you will find that you can fold the entry for the bottom if you click on symbol + in front of the object . in this case , you will only see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene , you should shift the bottom line to the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select Shift and set the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but you can choose a simple one at the moment .
in both cases a dialog opens , in which you can select how to insert the object . please select first object . you can change the name in the property view ( name = bottom @-@ pigment ) , with a click on the button preview you can see how the pigment looks now .
of course , the preview of the pigment only shows a matte black material , because you still have to enter settings for the pigment . always remember that you can check the look of materials at any time with a click on preview .
if you don &apos;t see any color on the header and ball in the preview , just click on the Apply button and then preview .
the material for the floor is set correctly now . if you are rendering your image now with a click on the symbol , you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the color you expected . here are additional settings necessary . in the color list you have to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more often , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
each time you select the color in the object tree and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
this step should be done simply because you should have already understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you should already have understood the sphere as easy as the floor :
in the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget to press the input key or the Apply button ) , so the ball has contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground , since you have moved the floor around one unit down .
of course rendering now a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . put a suitable material in the next step .
if you have chosen the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as with the floor , give the sphere a pigment as a color :
select First object and change the name for example in Ball Pig@@ ment . click on sphere pigment , then select In@@ to and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values as shown in the following screen@@ shots and click Apply or push the Enter key .
the brightness effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome @-@ plated surfaces , even if metal : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; offers . hopefully you have learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
ra@@ y@@ trac@@ y@@ pricing is a render method to produce a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three dimensional scene or model .
if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the rendering can shoot hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this ray is reflected by the objects in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog have an effect .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you view the scene . without a light source you also don &apos;t see anything , the image is just black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file that you created previously with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
once you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you will need to enter a name and disk space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last saved session will be dis@@ car@@ ded .
you can only select this menu entry if you don &apos;t have saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last revers@@ ed command . you can select this menu entry only if you have used Edi@@ ting Un@@ do .
saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ ride an existing arrangement .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , short@@ cuts and default behavior .
opens a dialog for changing keyboard short@@ cuts . you can use this option to modify or add new short@@ cuts for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; commands change or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set the tool@@ bars . you can use this option to add and remove tool@@ symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; commands .
a B@@ ump @-@ Map is an option for pre@@ ten@@ ding rough surfaces without having to model each dent on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a B@@ ump map as well as for a texture map .
basic shapes are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these base bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by applying a picture file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ dex@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
images can be displayed in either a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ dex@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can view by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ s ; or the Return key .
you can specify whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a particular file , simply type the first character of the filen@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a matching file name is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the Configuration &amp; Play Show dialog , there are five flash@@ cards . in three of them , General and Edi@@ ting and Sli@@ deshow , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ dex@@ show ; in the other two , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts for the respective windows can be specified .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color that you can set further down . default is not full screen mode .
when this point is activated , the next image in the folder will load , while you still look at the current image . this reduces the delay if you select the next image and is particularly suitable for a slide show .
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ dex@@ show ; when moving the name of the last opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; ku@@ dex@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the image , the background will also be filled with the selected color .
you can set up &amp; ku@@ dex@@ show ; set up that only some of the file types can be displayed that can also display the program .
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
determines whether the slide show should begin with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repeti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show is repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 1 .
change the keyboard short@@ cuts for the different modes of operation of &amp; ku@@ dex@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards brief instructions for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the file system with folders and files in one window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
displays thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
decreases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
includes the display window for the pictures . &amp; Play@@ Show ; is also closed if no browser window is opened .
view the picture in original size . this is only useful when the automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the filen@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ screen@@ shot ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing . &amp; show@@ screen@@ shot ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; project .
&amp; show@@ screen@@ shot ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and make corrections and changes .
as the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ screen@@ shot ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user helping his part to report at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ screen@@ shot ; makes it as easy as possible to report errors or possible improvements . wherever you are in the program , the menu contains an entry to report problems or wishes . this displays a dialog with a link . if you use this , your browser opens a page for reporting problems and wishes . all required information is already filled out , and you can just follow the instructions to give your message .
&amp; show@@ screen@@ shot ; is a project supported by a community . if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ fig ; if you are a common user of the show@@ screen@@ shot , then we would like to encourage you to answer questions to other users of &amp; show@@ fig ; however , in this mail@@ ing@@ list English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
the best way to participate in the show@@ screen@@ shot is to join the developer mailing list . instructions to join the developer mailing list from &amp; show@@ fig ; .
&amp; show@@ screen@@ shot ; try to give you so much control over its workflow as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of the show@@ screen@@ .@@ To access these settings , you need to set up the show@@ screen@@ shot in the menu . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left side .
in the field of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator was selected . skill @-@ wise should contrast the colors with what you should display . under@@ exposure should indicate a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of the show@@ screen@@ shot has a side@@ bar at the right edge which provides important information and actions to the selected images . you can view the same side@@ bar in image editing . you can view it by clicking on one of the five tabs :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that no longer makes to scan and save images .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that no longer makes to scan and save images . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for saving for each image or save the images in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . the user can also display the images before saving .
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a default scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog for selecting the scanner will be opened .
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner . Cancel will stop &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; Cancel .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not handle these options particularly .
to scan a picture , the user can start a preview scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview will fit into the window .
when the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the Scan button .
if before saving a preview is selected in the settings , then the image is displayed in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image is saved and Sch@@ lie ? s leads to a break and you will get back to the main window .
the Settings button opens the dialog with the same name in front of the main window . you can change the main settings here .
the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows you to select the type as &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; images saved . dialog to Save for each image opens the dialog in front of each scanned image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; this will automatically save it with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must select Save without asking for a filen@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images will be saved with the Save option without asking for a file name . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder will be used as the default for dialog for saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change this using the button ...
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the images to be stored automatically and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically saved image gets a numerical suff@@ ix that is uploaded every time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if choosing the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the Help button starts the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the knob About starts the K@@ DE about -@@ dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; . the Settings button displays the dialog for Settings and C@@ lose can be used to quit &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; .

below you can set up a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global short@@ cuts can be set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and selecting Global key short@@ cuts . clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and setting short commands ... select .
you can set up existing multi @-@ media buttons in such a way that they function as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short commands . this will make your keyboard &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface from Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browsers , players , play@@ lists , play@@ lists browsers and scripts . an example call for the D@@ CO@@ P function break could &amp; z@@ b ; look like this :
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de , and Amar@@ ok also has some command line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependen@@ cy . please check in your script if all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog to enable the user to know why a script does not run .
start require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ruby ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply extend them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in each K@@ DE installation .
most script languages make it possible to execute external programs and commands . usually the ex@@ ec ( ) function is used . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be inv@@ oked relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends al@@ erts to all running scripts . for this reason , strings are written to the default input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore the events when there is no use for it .
configure Sets the script to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be saved .
track@@ Change Shows that a new piece is being played . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can query more information about the new piece ( for example , the metadata or the length of the piece ) .
Volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er between 0 and 100 .
customize Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le Categories Con@@ tains the path to the selected files of the playlist when a custom menu entry is cli@@ cked . to add an entry you can use the D@@ CO@@ P function d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Item ( Sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) . to remove an entry you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Item ( Sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do , for example , storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages which the user &amp; z@@ b has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ tar ) .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept scrip@@ ting packages with the em@@ power@@ ment of amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script packages right away .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the other modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file permissions :
if your script package is ready , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry to k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the Amar@@ ok ; scripts category .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . you might also find a very specific title for thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then the playlist browser is just the right thing for you . and if you still find it hard to choose , the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . furthermore , many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right way to re@@ discover your music !
usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto conf and autom@@ ake are used , you should not have any trouble comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options that can be activated or de@@ activated at compile time using the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the compile options certain dependen@@ cies must be met to be used . details can be found in the System Requirements section .
enables de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without effort across the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the different functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
in addition to the player window , the player window will turn on or off in addition to the playlist . if the option is disabled , only the playlist window will be displayed .
voice bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for mo@@ od@@ bar compiled . the option switches the experimental function of the mood bar@@ ometer .
more atmospheric : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for mo@@ od@@ bar compiled . this modi@@ fies the used color scheme for the mood bar@@ ometer .
save voice files from the music files : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for mo@@ od@@ bar compiled . if this setting is enabled , .@@ M@@ ood files will be stored in the location of the appropriate music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files will be stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / mo@@ od@@ bar / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; should be started when a browser is needed .
other browsers use : here you can specify the path to another browser that is not in the list above .
save the playlist when moving , save the current playlist automatically when moving &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist when moving .
relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : when you activate this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , will use . otherwise , the absolute position of music files will be saved .
keeping the current piece visible when changing the piece causes the playlist to pop up / down to keep the current piece in the visible part of the window .
changing the context browser automatically displays the context browser when the next piece is played .
in the App@@ ear@@ ance section you can adjust the appearance of Amar@@ ok ; the section is divided into three parts .
in the font section , you can set the use of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; set . by selecting own fonts , the otherwise gray displayed section is enabled . you can select fonts for the following range : playlist Pan@@ es , Player Window and Con@@ text Browser . click Select ... so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the Custom color scheme selection , you have the choice of choice and you can set your own color scheme . to do so , use the color selection for foreground and background color .
resume playback when starting , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , resume play automatically with the piece at the point with which it was stopped at the last stop .
setting up the On @-@ Screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is used , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
using your own colors gives you the option to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . clicking on the color faces opens the dialog for selecting colors . if your own colors are not enabled , the default colors are used .
the Display text entry field displays the text shown in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ cards , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your own needs . below is a list of the available space holders and what they mean .
the Display option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users , so you can specify on which screen a multi @-@ monitor environment should appear on the O@@ SD .
the audio card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers enable further adjustments in this card .
the Collection box collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder that should browse &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , mark the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes for setting how to proceed with the selected folders .
recur@@ sively search sub@@ folders : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the ti@@ cked as well as their sub@@ folders will be searched for music .
monitoring changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders to changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import play@@ lists : effects that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collections folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) added to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists appear later in the playlist browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further configuration is required in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; under Calcul@@ ator : enter the host on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . after that , the network port is entered under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use username : and password : to enter the data needed for connection to the database .
the card@@ boards last@@ .@@ f@@ m addresses the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece if necessary .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send played pieces and then update the profile : this setting allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
call for similar performers : after activating this setting , Amar@@ ok ; a list of similar performers will be retri@@ eved to the played piece . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok requires only the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the included programs , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find , for example , modules or scripts ) . we have written a small tutorial on how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ ose that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ escal@@ top@@ .org . so Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will cause difficulties , for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these provide an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files causes a bug in the tag library for days . you can locate the file by looking in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this bug to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and app@@ end the broken file that caused the crash .
it is mostly because Tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this bug to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is somewhat more mature .
make sure that all libraries used by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries with the same comp@@ iler version were compiled . if , for example , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b but G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes when editing the met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then disable automatically if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail opens automatically during a crash ) . if this is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be corrected .
this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 into the met@@ a information , but do not mark them as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ mp@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Error in writing the tags of $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &apos; unless $ mp@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ day , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repeat / dynamic play@@ lists ) are always actively visible in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects are simply forgotten . note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error , amar@@ co app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ca app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ D@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ca app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this bug , you may need to remove any conflic@@ ting Q@@ t version or modify / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok finds the correct version first .
most installation problems are easiest through the help of an expert in your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter only one error if you find something in the correction of a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only a blank playlist appears . how do you get music pieces there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the folder you want . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to make the GUI more intuitive , the Start window has been converted to the statistics window . you can find it under Extras statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for rating by the user while the points are calculated automatically .
to evaluate ch@@ unks , the review column must be displayed in the playlist . click the title bar of the playlist and select column Show rating . click anywhere in the new application column to specify the rating for a piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard . or right @-@ click on your selection and then select From Play@@ list Remove from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with your mouse into the playlist and drop it there , just like you would do with other files . that &apos;s how easy it is : - )
in the toolbar of the playlist , right next to the Add button , you will find the Play@@ list button . click on it .
you probably don &apos;t have the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config . install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ tool , this package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ zations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
none ! yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , therefore the real question is what types of media support G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ M ? . as you can see , we support pretty much any imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and PNG !
it may ! perhaps you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , where in default no MP3 deco@@ ders are provided ( for pat@@ ent@@ age reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 node , input key
start the Ya@@ ST Online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s : - )
if you are using the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the al@@ sa @-@ sink , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer enables several applications to use the device at the same time and to output audio simultaneously . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to provide another sink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ sink ) .
this does &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media first need to be deco@@ ded . you can &apos;t just send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you &apos;d just want to listen to a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is reading the file , deco@@ des it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound servers with the highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that the SU@@ ID device wra@@ pper is set :
K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x has problems with K@@ DE multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed playback . read this bug report . enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia complete to get the faster Arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less supports react the visu@@ ali@@ zations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ab . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you will need to register all components . follow the registry to register all the G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask in the I@@ RC channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( quit Amar@@ ok earlier ! ) : - Download and install ff@@ m@@ peg , once as system administrator and once as your regular user . then delete all the ff@@ m@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer module folder ( you will find the module folder with the config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run it again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
please report it under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. if you have a complete list of proposals / wishes , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm run this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you are awak@@ ened by the soft tones of the music you have stopped before going to bed .
how to get to know the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current titles if you are on another computer ?
if there is a functioning SSH environment , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you interpreter and title of the running piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ ip d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ user name Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this requires your identification in the ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa file .
the visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . press the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window that can be changed in size .
the combination of C@@ trl + Right M@@ ouse sets a piece in the queue order in the queue . pressing the Enter key after a search in the playlist will play the first search result and reset the search .
OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky features , but how about the icon in the system section of the control bar ?
click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ s ; click on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browsers you want to display .
my Personal Fol@@ der $ HO@@ ME is on an NFS drive . after amar@@ ok launch , the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to link to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click on the audio CD in the menu . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic encoding , instead , take files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g instead .

basically this fits the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less impact each individual score has on the overall score .
you can enter the rating for a piece by right @-@ clicking on a column heading in the playlist window . then you can change the evaluation of a piece as well as all other attributes , namely by clicking with the right mouse button on the piece and editing : select review or press F@@ 2 . you can also edit the rating in the Metad@@ ata dialog .
the developers do not want you to tell you when you want to release a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a specified release plan that is not compatible with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find annoying . de@@ activate the option icon while playing animated in the general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool bar . select Set@@ ting Set@@ ting tool@@ bars ... and take the desired changes there .
download a design , or create your own . then install it under Amar@@ ok ... App@@ ear@@ ance context @-@ browser design , click New Design to install ....
the icon was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid difficulties it was removed .
Kon@@ quer@@ or &apos;s navigation pane allows you to monitor and control Amar@@ ok ; while browsing the Kon@@ quer@@ or . start Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation pane . then click the Settings button ( top ) and select Add Amar@@ ok ; click the Add Amar@@ ok drop @-@ down menu .
audio @-@ osc@@ anim@@ ator is a free service to be sent to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free of charge and you only need a free user name and password .
if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and therefore a lot of bug reports .
probably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you must re@@ configure and install Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ?
you probably have to install a distribution that will install the development files separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , you will need to install the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel package . the same applies to x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you will need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel .
I receive the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix this ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : don &apos;t use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS when you compile Amar@@ ok .
I present the error message of There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module has to be installed next to G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad .
you will receive the error of There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play an MP3 stream , but the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run it as System Manager . then restart Amar@@ ok .
I have a second sound@@ card and I use AL@@ SA . how can I use Amar@@ ok to use the second sound@@ card ?
setting up Amar@@ ok ... Audio output gives you the device . typical is e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
the intel@@ pp@@ .@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
in the setup dialog of x@@ ine , enter us@@ b @-@ audio and the output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of the sample rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the check box on sound card supports m@@ map .
sorry , but the audio @-@ edition with Arts will not be further looked after . of course you are welcome to take this problem yourself ! if you would like , you can become the new so @-@ urgently needed super@@ visor for arts : )
listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the Setup Wizard that is displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to update your collection subsequently or simply don &apos;t like the wizard , this quick start guide will help you . with your help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in a few minutes .
creating a playlist is very easy . drag and drop entries from the collection browser into the playlist . the small text field to filter the collection will help you to find the matching entries . if you are satisfied with the playlist , you can save it with the button &apos;s Play@@ list button .
if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add this to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , and you have enabled the option to import play@@ lists , then these play@@ lists are already in the tree view . by right @-@ clicking on a playlist , you will find different ways to load the playlist .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; assumes the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . in addition , some additional packages are listed that make the work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more pleasant .
if you install these packages via a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player has also &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however , a playlist that is superior to all others . the playlist window contains multiple browsers with which you can capture and browse your entire music collection .
this chapter explains how to use all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; including creating a collection and a playlist .
the Player Window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Control Centre . at the top of the window is a running text display that shows the current piece or the current stream . directly below it is the area , the play time , bit rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current play . a click on this area changes the ad of the already expi@@ red play time to the remaining play time of the play .
the Player Window also includes a selection of audio analy@@ zers , also under the message text display . you can change through the available analy@@ zer by clicking the left mouse button on the area .
the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be dis@@ connected from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will be displayed in an independent , expanding window .
the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also included in the running text display . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the Play@@ list window , while the E@@ Q button is used to set equ@@ ali@@ zers .
the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the piece @-@ position sli@@ der . use the sli@@ ders to adjust the piece position or volume . with playback buttons , you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece .
the use of the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own preferences .
to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you mark the check box E@@ quali@@ zer , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation .
the &amp; Amar@@ ok playlist ; is the most advanced playlist of all available multimedia players . it has many features that do not exist in any other player . but don &apos;t let the abundance of functions deter you , they are all easy to use .
the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , on the left is the navigation pane . in the navigation pane , you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . on the right @-@ hand side is the playlist itself . the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users powerful enough .
the context @-@ browser displays various information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be adapted with the help of context @-@ browser designs . the context @-@ browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and performer . these three sub@@ windows will be explained later in detail .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you might notice that the sub@@ window starts to fall away . the information presented there is now divided into other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; it is also possible to view the information collected in the statistical window ( Extras statistics ) .
the music sub @-@ window displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the performer and the album .
the first section in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z Symbol . click on this icon to check the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
you will find further information on the current piece under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its rating .
to display cover images in the context browsers , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the image file formats .@@ jp@@ g , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ ng are supported . the contex@@ tual browser will also display covers images that were either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
among the selected pieces are the favourite pieces of this performer . this section shows the five most valued pieces of the current artist .
you can specify which information should be displayed in the music sub@@ window . to do so , right click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , albums of the performer , lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be opened and you will see the content of the album .
you can click on all pieces in the single fields to immediately start playing . you can also right @-@ click on it and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu .
this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages using self @-@ written scripts . once you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text @-@ script is running , you can choose which to start .
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is required .
the Find button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Artist - group@@ ed only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres are dis@@ regarded .
group@@ ing Artist / Album - First the pieces are arranged according to the artist , and a further division is made according to the respective album . if you want to see compositions or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Various artists .
group Artist / Year - Album - S@@ ort by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically by each other . the artist will be ignored .
group@@ ing genre / artist - your tunes will first be sorted by genre and , below , artist .
group@@ ing genre / artist / album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the performer .
the remaining buttons allow you to customize and combine the group@@ ing as desired .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically capture your collection once you change something on the selected folders . if you own a lot of pieces , this might take a while .
a search filter is located directly below the toolbar . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . information about using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual .
below the search filter is a selection box , with which help you can filter out the most recently added pieces to your collection . you can also choose from different time windows , starting from the last 24 hours to one year .
clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser gives you the following options .
load - This emp@@ ties the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order .
att@@ aching to Play@@ lists - Add the selected songs to the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry , you will get the same effect .
set pieces in queue - This function will insert the selected pieces into the queue . this will be played next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
transfer the pieces to the media player for transfer to media players . see the Media Player Browser section for more details .
burn all pieces of this performer / burn to CD - This will cause the selected pieces to be sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or as an audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option will not be displayed .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Open dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) Move files into the tr@@ ash bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
mark the selection - select the selected album as a compilation , and it will appear under different interpre@@ ters .
picking up a compilation - Chan@@ ges the album marked as a compilation back into a normal album . afterwards , the album is no longer displayed under various interpre@@ ters but again under the associated interpreter .
the playlist browser makes dealing with many play@@ lists very easy . among other things , it also includes Intelligent Play@@ lists .
the lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at runtime . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist containing the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click on Smart Play@@ list to open the dialog for creating a new smart playlist , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the Media Player sub@@ window is used for connecting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod , for example . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod to Interpre@@ t sorted in the upper list view of the Media Player Browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list Interpre@@ t . if you &apos;re done , click Apply . thus , the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod . if the transmission is finished , quit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and lo@@ osen the drive connection for your iPod .
under the toolbar you find a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser is an address bar with which you can fetch music from a given URL . for example , enter / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press enter key , you can listen to music in the music .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , dropping files may be difficult by simply dropping the shift key . in this case the holding down of the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position .
you can change the order by simply drag@@ ging the entries to the desired place by simply drag@@ ging the entries with the mouse . as soon as you enter letters there , only the pieces that contain the characters are displayed . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty again .
if you enter del@@ im@@ ited search terms by spaces , search &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries containing all search terms . if you enter , for example , one two , the search will find all entries containing one , two and three .
if you type OR between the search terms OR , search for entries containing either one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces that contain one or two or three are found ( or a combination of them ) .
if you want to search for entries containing spaces , then close the keyword with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries that Mike Old@@ field contain , but not for entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a specific search column , you can also search for larger or smaller . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . This is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain something .
you can combine these syntax versions at will . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 comment : bad . this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment baths .
you can set the sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ trl key , and then with the right mouse button in the desired order on the entries . the entries then receive a marking with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the playlist . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left , you will find the button Add , which you can add to the playlist .
next , the buttons will follow und@@ o and restore , so you can und@@ o or restore changes to the playlist .
a unique , increased analy@@ zer is located in the middle of the toolbar . the refresh rate can be set to the Analy@@ zer by clicking the right mouse button .
the last button in the toolbar is menu . it opens the same menu as that you can see in the Player Window using the right mouse button . through this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s Configuration .
there are many more buttons available for the toolbar , for example , playback controls and volume controls . you can set up the buttons by clicking on the menu and setting up toolbar buttons .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it shows the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for random mode and retri@@ eval , a sli@@ der for the playing position and the playing time of the current piece is displayed .
you can also hide the status bar . to do so , disable the status bar in the General Settings .
the contex@@ tual menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking in the playlist on the menu . this menu allows you to reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok ;
clicking on this entry will open the window visu@@ alisation plugin . there you can select the visu@@ ali@@ zations of &amp; Amar@@ ok ;
behind this entry is a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start it by selecting cover@@ art cover management in the collection browser .
the cover management includes a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the artist on the left side .
with the View menu , you can select what should be displayed in the cover administration . select :
the queue management got your big collection in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this function you have even more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece in the queue , a number appears in the playlist next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 will play first , 2 as second , and so on .
if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the contex@@ tual menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already predefined ( the details of setting up these later ) .
fills your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds more random pieces during playback .
add pieces based on load .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audio @-@ osc@@ ann@@ ers ) . this mode requires that there are already some pieces in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a load .@@ f@@ m profile for this dynamic playlist to work .
double click on the playlist you want , drag it into the playlist window or click with the right mouse button on you and then select Load . this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist . so you should save the old playlist in some circumstances !
the two pre @-@ set modes of Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ list Mix immediately fill in your playlist and you can start playing directly . the recommended pieces will start with an empty playlist and you will need to add at least one piece from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added at the next piece change , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , activate the last possible dynamic mode : setting Dynamic Mode . this will use your existing playlist as starting point . this will also be disabled via the same menu entry .
the New Fil@@ l button emp@@ ties the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . edit the playlist opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the settings .
with a right click on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . this will open dialog to edit the playlist settings .
enter any name for the playlist here . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for incoming pieces will be ski@@ pped and they will not hear a play twice in this playlist . however , if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed while resp@@ ecting the play@@ lists .
played pieces - this is the number of pieces played that are to be kept at the beginning of the playlist . this allows you to easily see which pieces have been played recently .
this is the number of pieces that should be added to the playlist after each played piece . if you set more than 1 , the playlist will grow continuously because only one piece can be played and removed .
the right @-@ hand settings are already described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you tick more than one playlist , you will add &amp; Amar@@ ok ; random items from each of the play@@ lists you have checked .
some scripts make your own settings possible . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then clicking on setup .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; scripts by clicking on scripts . a selection dialog will open in which a script package can be selected for installation . after you have installed the script , a new entry appears in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet .
if you do not want to use a script for a longer period , you can delete it . to do so , select the script to delete and then click Un@@ install .
if you are looking for information about writing your own scripts , please refer to Using scripts section .
the dialog window Visu@@ alization plug@@ ins is used to activate the available visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plug@@ ins . to use a plug @-@ in , simply activate the check box next to the name .
this Quick Start will show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b in four steps . to track the steps you need a sound installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog box where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other loss@@ less compressed formats then remember that when encoding to MP3 , you will get a po@@ orer quality , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD has been created by a loss@@ less format . use the au@@ CD@@ t@@ ect project .
in this dialog box , you can do nothing . please wait for the computer to complete the burning process .
this Quick Start will show you how to copy &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; copy a data CD in just four steps . to understand the steps you must have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and insert the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
to copy a data CD , please select Extras , Copy CD ... from the menu . you now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning .
after you have done all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , please press the Start button . you now see a dialog which looks like this or something like this :
in this dialog box , you can track the progress of the copy process . once you have finished reading the original in the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium on which the data should be burned .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you need to wait until the overall progress has reached 100 % .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you need to wait until the overall progress has reached 100 % .

&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program will burn audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a flow ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burns all types of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions that also &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; typically sel@@ ects &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; typically automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; however , a higher quality of burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . in the Internet , such programs are generally referred to as ri@@ ppers .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional audio encoding technology and for dealing with audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Dek@@ oder@@ - und Enco@@ der modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG Audio decoder . currently it supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported .
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 encoder module .
fla@@ c : a free open source co@@ dec for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ MPEG , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack decoder : more libraries for processing different audio formats . with FF@@ MPEG , for example , it is possible to dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t WMA files to burn it to an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : a utility that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the SO@@ X Audio Enco@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a fully featured auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analy@@ zing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can , for example , be useful for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without Norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the unpleasant effect that the music pieces will play differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to be able to start from CD and automatically playback all the videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the related sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . clicking on an entry will open the project .
save the current project . if the project has been saved once , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise a new file name will be asked .
save the current project under a new filen@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As is shown , with which you can select folders and file name for the project file .
save all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call Save file for each project file .
closes the current project . if a project has been modified and not yet saved , asks &amp; k@@ 3@@ b . you can then choose between saving and making changes . you can also stop closing and keep the project open .
includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project what to do with it , just as if you had called for each project file closing .
closes all opened projects and ends &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for each project that is not stored , you will be asked what to do with it as if you would have called a file closing .
when you access this entry , you can select files to add to the project through the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you move the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the files added will appear in the base folder of the CD .
open the &quot; Burn &quot; dialog for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the project &apos;s properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; promp@@ ts for the burning of the medium . the burning dialog can only be opened if the project already contains data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described by the What is the ? help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry only appears for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful when you compile files for a multi @-@ session CD . the data of the previous session will always be included even if this feature is not used . it is more likely to be considered for help so that you can see the files and folders already present on the medium .
this entry only appears in an active data CD / DVD or Video @-@ DVD @-@ Project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files will remain in the project . this function does not remove any files from the medium , it only displays the previously imported files .
open the CD Copy dialog . this allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can also create a copy of a CD that you can burn later on . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
the DVD Copy dialog opens , allowing you to copy DVD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can also only create a copy of a DVD , which you will burn later on . also , the copy / reduction of a DVD with the help of the copy dialog has not yet been supported , so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in its original form .
open the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete the entire contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
open the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , whereby the content is completely er@@ ased . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; allows you to choose between the write modes over@@ write and incre@@ mental .
the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button .
this dialog window appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the read video , encoding settings , and even options for changing the size and cutting black borders .
displays information about the submitted medium . this information is displayed in the content view and includes properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is enabled , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view will display an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , their contents will be displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as Media info , locks and unlock the drive or ej@@ ecting the medium .
the content view allows selecting and drag@@ ging files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read out audio or video CDs , if a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD has been selected in the folder view .
the header is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog box to change the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after you have selected one of the available commands in the top part , you can adjust the key mapping to the bottom .
this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct permissions to burn CDs and DVDs . to do this , you need to set the system administrator rights , so when you start the wizard , you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work at first . this dialog is for person@@ al@@ ising and fine tuning of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . using this interface , parts of the functionality may be controlled , for example , via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line or the somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in functional scope , so your taste and nature of your task is critical , which of the accompanying programs will give you the advantage .
in this chapter , we assume that you use the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you need to make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b is started . then enter something like the following at the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , which all &amp; k@@ de ; program have in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format@@ ted DVD and other functions for creating new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Astro@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project via command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ v@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which can only be applied to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ string parent ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String New@@ Name ) void set@@ Volume ID ( Q@@ String id )
this makes it possible to fill out a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders , and then inserts files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ read for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it can easily be read audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible depending on encoder installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on hard drive ) and by many enco@@ ders that enco@@ des these wa@@ v files ( loss@@ less compression ) by default ( These enco@@ ders must still be installed from the Linux distribution ) . other enco@@ ders may be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and saved to WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these wa@@ v files ( usually one per cap@@ tion ) are compressed into mp3 or O@@ GG format or other formats such as loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , read out the &amp; CD ; it is used by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) should be installed og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders , so it is very likely not necessary to compile something yourself . however , only the enco@@ ders need to be installed that are needed . if for example FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not required .
which coding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction about enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading out the audio data from the CD ; if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device prevents protection , it is not possible to b@@ ypass any protected audio CD ; even do not avoid the mechanisms of copy protection . simply avoid buying copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while setup only needs to be performed once ( the setup dialog can be called up until a suitable configuration is found ) , the daily use for reading a &amp; CD is explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to the understanding of the lean approach of the user interface , which you will often stum@@ ble through at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ ders are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without network , with everything being recorded manually .
this is just a short list of commands from the main window . on the step by step example , further information on how this program is used , as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tabs for configuration of the program are located .
start CD@@ DB request of the CD data according to the setup of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this may be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet has to be established first . )
starts reading and - when an encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup index - the encoding .
opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders , so that the selection can be read with a different encoder than the default . it must be noted that before the encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dialog .
open the file manager so that an already read file is selected for encoding rather than a full &amp; CD ; read out and en@@ code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pic@@ s ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main setup dialog of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; with different card slots ( such as Enco@@ der , for setting the encoder ) . you need to go here before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ders and compression ratios and helps you choose the correct encoder .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is required . apart from FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; which may be available for this distribution . the draw@@ backs are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files .
among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 kb@@ ps ) , but above this bit rate the differences become less important since both enco@@ ders generate very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame will still be supplied with most distri@@ butions free of charge , but there are open license questions
+ high to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality with lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music should be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play@@ sites exists .
MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto hi @-@ fi systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly support only MP3 format .
a short list of audio quality parameters and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide acceptable visibility for most people and most music pieces , and has already quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems of high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 kb@@ ps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 kb@@ ps for complex music pieces and a little less for complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems of high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 kb@@ ps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs always 256 kb@@ ps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems of high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 kb@@ ps C@@ BR , common stereo , compression rate approx . 11 128 kb@@ ps for all pieces of a song . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and car oster@@ ol@@ aters . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ kb@@ ps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without considering the file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that is entered manually or automatically fet@@ ched from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet is available in the program as a list of parameters . you can commit / use it with &amp; k@@ audio creator ; and the encoder program to create folder and file names as well as the properties of music files .
in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ ders and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the coding bars explain the switches for these programs .
e.g. to add the &amp; CD ; tracks to the keywords ( English : day ) when MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audio creator must be added . the result looks like &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button designation in the Wizard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download information , so that all others can download the information instead of entering the computer . it &apos;s important to note that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of the translator : this is meant by the author ) bin not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from being attached to the CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . any information can be obtained anyway with a bum@@ per through a CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is active to select a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( fake ) address as the one set in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears , the email address is not used when retri@@ eving data from the server ( this can only know the programmer who checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; used to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the hosts .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; . alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
what read@@ out program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in wa@@ v files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; those who want to know more accurately , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; s . note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this hasn &apos;t happened yet .
to save the selected wa@@ v files , the encoder and the desired file format can be selected . the first opening contains predefined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( loss @-@ free compression for audio data ) on the encoding tab . other enco@@ ders can be added to this tab .
the encoder package must be installed from the corresponding Linux distribution before using the enco@@ ders . this is also required for the pre @-@ defined enco@@ ders . more information about enco@@ ders can be found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a encoder , more information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , read and write permissions on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ n@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you don &apos;t want a copy @-@ proof audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not work !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program exactly what you want .
in this example we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 224 to 256 kb@@ ps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 words ( tags ) .
both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found , for example , with a search engine as it is regarded as not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can of course always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you own write permission ( eg ; by trying to copy something into it ) .
the first section deals with the basic set @-@ up of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; something that is likely to be done only once and
the second section describes how to read out a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each out@@ going &amp; CD .
here we determine the enco@@ ders to use for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 kb@@ ps ) . since we are la@@ zy , we share the program with which fre@@ ed@@ b to use the &amp; CD ; download data from the internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them at any reading of a &amp; CD ; change if the appropriate settings are found once .
the device name is passed to the reading program so it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look at the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of the device desig@@ nations for CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the card @-@ card General settings . here there is not much to do . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything is left / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
select only in case of incomplete information , so that you will be informed if information about the creation of keywords ( tags ) is missing .
the card board CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet in order to access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection box is easier , will be a &amp; CD ; entry found , immediately starts reading the &amp; CD ; . this is associated with low risk if you are later un@@ satisfied with the database entry and the directory name / filen@@ ame resulting from it , and the directory / filen@@ ame resulting from it will be changed to K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; node ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , note that if you want to enter everything manually , disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . however , you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to use the database before . however , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card board .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for calling the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the fre@@ ed@@ b section . set everything as shown in the screen@@ shot .
mode : we did not download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org site and look for a mirror server near you . on this way , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work equivalent to the server , as many fire@@ walls will boot the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with the 80 protocol , as the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example we do not want to transmit data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box should suff@@ ice .
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the / tmp directory exists on your computer )
number of simultaneously dischar@@ ging pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? read and code parallel ? the author does not know , therefore simply try it yourself .
disc@@ ard CD ; disc@@ ard after reading the last piece : tick this to check the CD ; disc@@ ard at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this then / must be specified the path / folder where the wa@@ v files are saved . this can be useful if there is only room on another drive . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself .
enter everything as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something has to be brow@@ sed to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned earlier , this is sufficient for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit rate is on average around 224 @-@ 256 k@@ p@@ bs . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; to restrict the generation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; Tags can also be deleted if wished . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; node ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as shown in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of simultaneously enco@@ ded wa@@ v files : with a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad core or even a multi@@ processor machine , you can try to code more than one wa@@ v file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; used . if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change it again .
this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; runs on the hard disk . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , has been set up in the previous section . first , a connection to the Internet is established , since we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each out@@ going &amp; CD .
since we use a CD , which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a bit different from the data obtained by fre@@ ed@@ b . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; manually insert data instead of removing it from the Internet . comments are pointing to the differences .
do not try the &amp; CD ; this example can be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this has not been done yet , the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive that has been defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as shown in the screen@@ shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; can be identified as Audio CD ; can be read and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , then look for help in the section Questions and Ans@@ wers , or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
note : if the &amp; CD was successfully fet@@ ched by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all the titles of the pieces are already filled in and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed .
in case there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; a window will pop up , and you can select the database entry that best matches your &amp; CD ; it fits .
if you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the toolbar . if you do not have a local database , but fetch the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; News Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer needs to be entered in the field of &quot; Ac@@ tual Tit@@ le &quot; unless you have a collection of different artists for each piece .
the bottom Comment field can be used for the individual comments of each piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that are common to all pieces of the CD .
note : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. if all words with upper@@ case letter start or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment area . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; maximum allowed .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later with the Tag Editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . check the help of the encoder to get more information .
simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the missing CD ; in this example , this is not important since we don &apos;t transmit the &amp; CD ; data anyway . for more information go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org website and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you will get back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD Editor appears again and you can see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data that we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . the title of the piece in any case and other information you desire .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed to the same way until you have entered all titles of the &amp; CD ;
note : this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the BO@@ M list .
note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece . a simple click on the line switches off the selection of the piece . make sure all pieces are selected , or press the All Pi@@ eces button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once .
when clicking the button selection starts reading the selection process , this window will appear to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the jobs and track what is going on .
click on the tab jobs to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , right under the buttons of the toolbar .
this is the window to check the jobs . the first piece is currently read out to the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the lower left part of the window in the status bar .
you will see this error when you try to work with a code that you haven &apos;t yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully co@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we entered here in the example . did you check if you have write access to the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece .
order 1 reads the first piece , it &apos;s finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 to the format MP3 . this allows reading and coding parallel . notice the status message in the bottom part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding . in the case of low @-@ performance machines , the result is unclear . the computer used with an AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to have a problem at simultaneous reading and coding ( of two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read out while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is in the queue of the encoder . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window opens with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for successful use of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . res@@ p . 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the encoder of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is maintained today within the &amp; k@@ de ; CVS as part of the k@@ de@@ multimedia package . if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . most distri@@ butions already contain a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ audio creator . install the k@@ de@@ multimedia package from your distribution . if you read this , you probably already did it ...
this section is directed to people who compile from source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help , how the program can be adapted to your needs when it is running , then the following is true for you :
a program that calls many different programs has many variants of settings . the best way to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen@@ shots of the various flash@@ cards of the settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example .
hello , still reading ? even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked after the first startup of the program , without any reference point as it should continue from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD in the drive at the time of the program starts ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it all about ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately , no email . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator . whoever wants to add or change something useful may do it . at least after contacting the author . and if you read this , he left this section and is therefore in agreement with this suggestion .
strange if you have managed to get the source file from the &amp; node ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these informations , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kara@@ ok@@ esp@@ ack@@ er von &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke @-@ real @-@ time high@@ lighting of lyrics , he also has some properties that others &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound project driver needed for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequence er .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece .
graphic representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can drag and drop any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to k@@ mid .
supports both existing standards to save text into MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically determines the currently used process .
session Support . when you end &amp; k@@ de ; when playing a song , k@@ mid starts again with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the song you want .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . this also works with several songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the toolbar , select the Play from the menu item , or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts as soon as you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( for several pieces you will be added to a collection and then played one after the other . )
as soon as &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece plays , you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and navig@@ ating with the knob .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slowly , you can click on the arrows left and right of the speed display to change the playback speed . to restore the original tempo , double @-@ click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a play is played , a pressure on the space bar acts as a pressure on the button Pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu item , thus interrup@@ ts playback . pressing the space bar while no piece is playing starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics events and others . some pieces don &apos;t have any text at all : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can specify which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined , which a song is used , so that you don &apos;t have to manually set the text selection , but you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set an event type , select the entries of text or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has the 1 and 2 keys .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you can compose . these are played in series . this section tells you how to use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you can find this in the menu item under the point Organ@@ ize .... click on New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking copy and then specifying the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original one at the beginning .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the desired items in the collection manager .
the temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
when you leave the application , this collection will not be saved . remember that when you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the Add button . it will again be the file dialog with which help you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic Add to the collection .
when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) .
if automated add to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the pieces that are still open .
to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the song you want and then click Remove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series from the sub@@ menu of the menu collection , the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order is re @-@ specified .
to play a song , select it from the collection manager or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke text .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to skip a song , select the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Next song &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button , the next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to jump back a song , select the button Previous piece , the item For@@ ec@@ asting It@@ ems from the menu item or press the button arrow left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection you want to delete and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not play a role since it is not stored when leaving &amp; mid .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not general MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI map transl@@ ates general MIDI events into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map which converts all the events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano type into events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et type and thus always sounded a trumpet , if originally a piano should play .
if you have only one sound@@ card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI map , because all sound cards are GM -@@ compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI maps , so you have to edit the appropriate file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all required settings for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section that may appear as often as desired . however , this requires that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; The name of the Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; A further Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS ... EN@@ D
see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an email so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not general MIDI compatible .
this section specifies how the patches of General MIDI are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the equality sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM @-@ patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you must not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to lay all the sounds that this instrument needs to play on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a gun for example ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun shot .
so if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , no matter what sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that with the term drum patch the patch is meant to represent a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ary instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the sound represents the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards have ) .
the key@@ map section is used to specify how tones are m@@ apped on a specific channel or instrument . use is :
as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as is the presence . so , you need to create 128 entries .
you can define multiple key@@ maps for each channel and instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ words are used mainly to map sounds to the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel . see for example the included key@@ maps .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swa@@ p the first and second channel , do this in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for Key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel that is m@@ apped to the N channel . if you use the Key@@ map option , you will need to define the keyword with the name name for that channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events that try to change the patch on this channel will be ignored . in this case patch x will always be used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio specifies in which ratio pitch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multiplied . so if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with n , it is converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used to avoid decim@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM pre@@ tends that a keyboard that receives a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a tone higher . unfortunately , some Key@@ boards are trying to play two sounds up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you must try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . you can find this in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI Settings
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you can see which sounds are played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel . for each channel there is a drop @-@ down list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the knob is no longer green , but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to display the played tones . in the View menu , select View Channel view : settings
the speed @-@ LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; . this allows the same MIDI file to perform on two different devices to very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
good , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support . to fix the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example , k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files separately .
simply browse the folder you want to add to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
make sure to activate Automatic Add to the collection before . otherwise , the temporary files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down playback . to restore the default tempo , double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have an &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; open on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file , I just have to change to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the file to the &amp; k@@ mid window .
if you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection , turn the setting Automati@@ cally add to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. First you just want to play the first file . so set the setting Automati@@ cally add to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard , I encourage me to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; laga ( Spain ) .

if you want to know where you can download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
if you send me a postcard from your home or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will list ( if you want to ) . but before sending a MIDI file , you should contact me as I might have the file already .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and didn &apos;t get money from anyone . I would like to point out that I only use it because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch was too high for AW@@ E cards .
my thanks also to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for the testing of the AW@@ E support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing the AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , O@@ la Sig@@ ur@@ dson , Marc Di@@ ef@@ en@@ bruch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Magn@@ us Pfeffer , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , an error notification or just a supporting e @-@ mail .
and of course my thanks also to all those excellent musicians on the net who give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ mid can be found on his homepage , which is located under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , search information and view images . you will also find links to sites with other kar@@ aoke songs , etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use an FM device or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you need to compile and compile with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you have a sound card except that you can of course not hear any music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; KM@@ Player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ on@@ o and FF@@ MPEG . the program is used to play video files of supported formats supported by M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on , as well as to play DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .

for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website on new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Ma@@ iling List .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is returned .
it is possible to save the preferred connections under the book@@ mark menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are playing after each other , you should use the category permanent playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level . if you click an entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and permanent playlist can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course you can only do this if &amp; KM@@ Player ; not running . the different files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / , can be changed by an editor , from the View menu and next editing mode . by clicking a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed .
after changing XML files , you need to select Play@@ list from the drop @-@ down menu and choose either the Edit Mode , or select another category .
all changes will be lost if the editing mode is left or another group is selected without comparing it to the playlist .
because of the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player ; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation during start and finish can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c and modi@@ fying &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be simply inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; KM@@ Player ; notice the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during start doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . however , this would be disturbing at the end @-@ animation , so the user can end the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite picture : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / etc .
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; in the toolbar of S@@ MB . here is the output of m@@ player .
there is no rider for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; everything must be configured through manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c , such as setting the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; played using the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; KM@@ Player ; it can even include the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
in order for the &amp; KM@@ Player to play &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player must be specified as a service provider for the mim@@ e type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog file assignments of K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; is in a console application to launch and search for error messages regarding loading the browser module library . if there are no errors , the Back@@ end issue is within &amp; KM@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu to check ) .
in order to always take a given back@@ end for a specific mim@@ e type ( of course only if this has been calculated ) , this must be done through manual change of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c . for example , Ph@@ on@@ on should play all og@@ g files :
&amp; KM@@ Player ; can play cards from TV , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be watched , the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured . for this , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configure the V@@ DR ( Video Data Recorder ) settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialog in the settings is under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port . there should be detected ports from which one is selected . the encoding to use must be found ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably contains a dv@@ b in it .
since the V@@ DR support of S@@ MEs can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this kind of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . that &apos;s why the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux expansion for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must be in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) the following :
internally , various names are used by S@@ MEs for the sources . at the time of the creation of this documentation , this is dv@@ d@@ Nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , FTP source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source .
is there any hints how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the HD@@ PAR@@ M -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom command can be done as root user after inser@@ ting the device . it is absolutely certain that / dev / c@@ drom shows the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine starts up slowly , why does each time my CPU have to be tested for its performance ?
note : the answer is over@@ hau@@ d. k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support , and is needed to compile &amp; zip .
latex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to use the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the Linux / Linux distribution . the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be included for the installation .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; -@@ Project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages of &amp; Ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further complic@@ ation and are included on the box ; -@@ website .
this manual is for everyone - independent of experiences with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users don &apos;t have to read this manual . however , all the suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is requested , the contact via the box should be established .
if questions arise or comp@@ iling &amp; Ki@@ le ; on or if extensions are requested , this should be addressed to the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; latex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; latex ; features in a graphical interface and within this a simple , direct and customized access to all &amp; latex ; programs . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use wizard has to be called the &amp; latex ; reference and powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and its possibilities , the manual should be consul@@ ted to K@@ ate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start working there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ;
for &amp; latex ; is the right exercise : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use , use a lay@@ man ( lay ) &amp; latex ; mac@@ ros . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it deri@@ ves from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while here is only a good view to &amp; latex ; given , it is not the ultimate book about it . to exercise properly , good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
the introduction includes at least the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class , the body begins with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } .
the quick @-@ entry wizard of &amp; Ki@@ le ; is an useful function for fast creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) offers some possibilities for the creation of the document . there may also be some settings related to the document .
document classes : this introduces the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; letter &#93; , report &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , editor &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , Proj@@ ector &#91; Proj@@ ector &#93; , Films &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined .
encoding : this sets the character encoding . it should use the character encoding of the system . modern systems increasingly use the U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of the &amp; latex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used additional packages for and latex ; for the integration they only have to be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( in compliance with German DIN regulations ) .
new users don &apos;t have to worry . it is only a short description of the functions and further information is given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers - as well as other source text editors - high@@ lighting the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . through &amp; Ki@@ le , it is quite likely that some mathematical area has not been closed . however , it is noticed by the modest appearance of the output file .
when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) from &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically generates an empty line ( for entering the text ) and the corresponding line to the command line of the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set in the Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . and latex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the most subtle and sub@@ paragraph the bottom element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse .
when creating your own &amp; latex ; files may be very helpful when searching for a DVI ; file . as soon as a DVI ; file is an independent file ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ atively File ) &#93; , jumps and boxes ; by one click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in the &amp; latex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is besides PDF the usual output ear@@ t of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; there are many tools to view , convert and to print DVI ; files for various systems and devices .
using the search search , the elements of the DVI ; file are added to the editor and as soon as an element has been cli@@ cked into the DVI ; file , the exact opposite is added . as soon as a section in the &amp; latex ; source code has been cli@@ cked , the corresponding position is j@@ umped into DVI .
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , working with others is incorporated .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project settings .
quick construction : the &amp; latex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there are no errors in the source code ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; video surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wa@@ sted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after quick construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when viewing the Edit tool bar , the three large selection fields should be noticed . the selection fields were developed for the fast classification of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; latex ; commands for sub@@ division are :
the selection box More is for inser@@ ting items such as keywords , foot@@ notes or references . the available options are :
name : this command creates a description for a section , an image , or a different element .
reference : used for reference to a specified term ( select a selection box possible ) .
when using Qu@@ ote a selection list is displayed with literary entries . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file belongs to a project . for editing of &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are required corresponding editors . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ b ; files can also be written in &amp; Ki@@ le ; by hand .
the last sel@@ ector with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ RE@@ E is used for the definition of the font . you can specify the fonts for the main text , the base notes , etc . the following fonts are available :
when calling &amp; Ki@@ le ; there are two options for selecting : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and specifying the settings . 2 . the document can be written from scratch .
the par@@ enth@@ eses under the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the font . if the font is not set at the beginning , this can also be done later in the text .
as soon as the above source code example has been entered , the &amp; latex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is the use of the context of building or button quick construction .
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; storage automatically exec@@ utes .
if you fail to compile the document , you should be looking for errors in logging . if you use quick construction &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , it should be automatically started . if this is not the case , the logging should also be followed .
an environment ( environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font E 12 is created and only a few columns are intended to have another font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } then allows the alteration of the font .
the changes are considered only within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and usability of the document . for example , certain fonts , fat print , ital@@ ics , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the active pressure and is valid until it is closed with \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be displayed recur@@ sively with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
after the background for writing the source text with the &amp; latex ; mark@@ up language was presented , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; .
as soon as a bit of text has been entered in the assistant , some adjustments should be made for the better read@@ ability of the document . at least a quote , a few passages in the grease and sp@@ aci@@ tive pressure and a poem can be applied to see the differences between these commands .
once the document has been viewed , an editor view or C@@ trl E can be returned to the editor ( internal viewer ) .
once the DVI file is created , the document can be printed out or converted to a Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . just try and have fun .
DVI ; is an independent file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ atively ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI file , the same steps as for creating the document are necessary ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed with file printing ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool bar allows the conversion of the DVI file into other formats . as soon as the DVI , file was created from the &amp; latex ; source code , the conversion into desired other formats can begin by means of the buttons in the tool bar .
the default search allows the direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; latex ; bin@@ dings . for this purpose , only Modern can set up under Settings ... Tools Construction to be selected .
in order to search for the pres@@ election , the mouse cursor has to be positioned in a row of the source text and then cli@@ cked on to select the template . the jump to the corresponding position in the DVI ; viewer is then carried out .
with this function in &amp; Ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with one click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; latex ; document of &amp; Ki@@ le ; opened and j@@ umped to the corresponding line . to do this , &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; Ey@@ epi@@ ece ( setting up ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
if you do not open the &amp; DVI file , an error may occur . if there is an error , this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window .
the logging file explains the source code of the source code . in the editor you can use the L@@ Te@@ X errors and N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X errors for jumps between errors . to view the defective line , you have to click on the error in logging and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jump to the wrong line .
once cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the toolbar , a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document . the default options are :
when selecting a blank document , a document can either be re @-@ written or used for the quick creation of a new document . further information can be found in the section .
hands @-@ like users of &amp; latex ; mostly use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created in &amp; Ki@@ le ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file must be opened or a new file is created . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template by sni@@ ff@@ ing an existing document and choosing file template from document ...
when creating a new document from a template by file New , some strings may be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings ...
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS $ $ : this string is replaced by typing in document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ Docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS $ $ &#93; { item } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . as soon as the document has been created this way , the following steps must be taken :
when creating a new document , your own template can then be chosen instead of the default options .
a template can be created from any &amp; latex ; files . if an easy way to create a template is taken , search for an Internet search and follow the steps described below .
&amp; k@@ ate ; used &amp; k@@ ate ; as internal editor . &amp; k@@ ate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting many different types of text files ( including also &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; k@@ ate ; can be done in the menu item directly from &amp; Ki@@ le ; out .
to learn more about &amp; rate ; and its possibilities , the manual should be consul@@ ted to K@@ ate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start working there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ;
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very convenient &amp; latex ; command reference , which can be called via the Men@@ Ã ¼ aid La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains an exclusive description of nearly all commands that can be found in &amp; latex ; use as well as their syntax .
a double @-@ click with cli@@ cked C@@ trl key to select the &amp; tex ; this means that in this way , when clicking the \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ big@@ ad@@ skip is only \ \ par .
when drag@@ ging the text with left mouse button pressed , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
using the arrow keys with pressed shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to search different types of source codes and to emphasize them . for example , the natural latex contains ; -@@ commands from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by a different color .
many assistants can add additional jump marks . this is an own type of book@@ marks within the text . the menu items Edit dive brands or the corresponding keys enable the jump to the next or last jump mark . this is also highlighted by this jump mark , so that it is automatically deleted at the first input of a character .
editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; ki@@ le ; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already excellent opportunities , have been added in &amp; ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; latex ; source code has been added ; special commands for their selection . under Edit menu , the following commands for text selection are included :
choose a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing a blank line on both sides ) . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; latex ; commands and all other lines of the source text . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; latex ; commands and all other lines of the source code .
select the word under the current cursor position . this selection also has an expanded meaning as this command also reads &amp; latex ; commands with a zip code ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
for reading a part of the document , it can be removed first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; k@@ ate ; offers the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; Ki@@ le ; with its own commands for a faster option .
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is included in the description to the section Export Sale paragraph .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; latex ; therefore , &amp; Ki@@ le offers ; for five more commands under Edit environment for one possible easy work with &amp; latex ; .
this command jumps to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
this command jumps to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to the environment .
if the cursor is located before or inside the \ \ begin { environment } , it is j@@ umped to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted environment commands , the remote view can be lost quickly . this command will close the last opened environment so that the ne@@ sted surrounding structure will not be destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special prec@@ ep@@ ts for the &amp; latex group ; groups specified by bra@@ ces { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that match those from the working environment .
this command jumps to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket .
this command jumps to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the cur@@ ly closed clasp .
if the cursor is in front of or behind the cur@@ ly clip of a &amp; tex group # , the group jumps to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
in the input of many ne@@ sted welded groups par@@ enth@@ eses can be quickly lost . this command will close the last opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be destroyed .
in &amp; latex ; two simple instructions are used as a belt . for the appropriate conversion is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; is used for two simple motion signs . also for the end of the application the sign &quot; is used . &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and holds two complete support signs for &amp; latex ; one .
this automatic entry of double quotes can be set up under Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
it can also be used for specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or French ) and therefore German or French directions . many other languages can also be used .
when pressing Shift ; input key for &amp; Ki@@ le ; an intelligent new@@ line break . if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not only a line break but also the \ \ item command .
within a table environment , join &amp; Ki@@ le ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with a subsequent line breaks off .
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; latex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be added under Settings ...
some users want to arrange the columns in tables -@@ environments and all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among each other . when pressing Shift ; Alt ; amp ; search &amp; Ki@@ le ; after the next tab in the above line . although this tab is not the associated tab , add &amp; Ki@@ le ; some space for the columns positions of the current tab .
although &amp; k@@ ate ; already provides a good source code completion , this has been extended in &amp; Ki@@ le ; for special commands ( mostly for &amp; latex ; ) , three different modes are built . three of them work as needed and the other two are for different modes of work under Settings box ... complete set .
when starting a new environment with the command \ \ begin { environment } , &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the button , the last letter of the input will be removed and thus the complete list will be removed . on the other hand , the list can also shrink by entering a further letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are nat@@ ally removed when selecting a command . alternatively , jump marks can be inserted , so that a jump to these positions is possible by editing jump marks N@@ ever Ho@@ ck brand and the desired parameters can then be fed .
under Settings ... Ki@@ le ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; complete adjustments can be made to these lists . there can be different types lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; commands as well as home@@ owners of the general language use will be selected .
the command mode is not useful for the completion of environments . it will always have a few letters to be entered with \ \ begin and the call of completion mode will result in a large list of environment commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for the completion of environments .
when calling the completion mode over the menu Edit complete environment or the key / key Alt + Shift key , the command is automatically folded to the environment and it appears \ \ begin { . afterwards , the environment can be resum@@ ed in an easy way and by pressing the input key can be completed .
once this is done , the environment is automatically closed again . as soon as &amp; Ki@@ le ; recognizes that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command is added .
under Settings box ; setting up ... Ki@@ le ; full adjustments can be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of completion mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; commands .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; supports custom lists of col@@ ds that can be replaced immediately by longer strings . the lists can be set up under Settings ... Ki@@ le can be set up . as an example of a drop @-@ down list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which for example the L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X entry is included .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word completion mode is initiated over the menu Edit complete trunc@@ ation or the key C@@ trl + Alt spac@@ eb@@ ar , the letter L is replaced by the \ \ La@@ Te@@ X string .
large roofs are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been found that many more people in a document are written more than once . thus , &amp; Ki@@ le ; the completion of all already written texts .
this mode can be set up in the Settings box ... Ki@@ le can be disabled completely . here , the threshold for the display of the completion can also be set .
the complete files can be installed in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Ki@@ le / complete / fashion / Person@@ s home folder . mode stands for Ab@@ brevi@@ ation , Dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex .
the graphic design dialog box designs the layout of graphics as easy as possible . to view the basics of graphic formats , the sections should be considered .
PS files are not as popular as PDF files but offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders of pages . if the PDF output is used , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted into a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf .
to view the result of the work , you need to compile the source code . all the construction tools are compiled in groups in the Men@@ Ã ¼ s Cre@@ ating , Create , and Create view .
for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used by the keyboard short@@ cut Alt ; 2 . afterwards , the DVI ; file is converted into a PS file by means of Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file is converted into a PS file and viewed using Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the Quick Build command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if a viewer is not used , a new window will be opened each time .
a new project will be asked about the project &quot; New Project .... &quot; the following information will be asked for the project :
when retri@@ eving the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows exec@@ uting EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed through scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be changed in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first you have to say that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = Ki@@ le ) with the following methods :
&amp; latex ; is a quite distinct system where basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a lot of different help to support the users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are supplied with many documents . it includes a documentation for the packages contained and a further &amp; latex ; reference .
this is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather a complete instruction manual for the &amp; latex ; commands contain and is therefore ideal for finding a particular format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; boxes ; in three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ Doc@@ t@@ k which contains a database with all files to &amp; Ki@@ le ; provided documents and for a graphical surface area .
all documents are divided into categories and the advantage is the search for package names or keywords . from &amp; Ki@@ le , only the results are displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or pressing the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; latex ; - / tex ; -@@ source editor available on all systems with installed &amp; node ; work space environment . &amp; Ki@@ le ; is also part of the Fink project , allowing &amp; Ki@@ le ; also available on &amp; Mac ; with OS @-@ X installed .
many thanks to those who strive for the Fort@@ ress of the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project aiming and sacrific@@ ing for many hours for the development of tools , which we all can use in compliance with the GNU General License .

&amp; ch@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . with the command line interface you can create random signatures or daily signatures from a list . this command line interface provides the signatures for external email programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random signatures , any signature is from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; read out . by many signatures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information , you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique .
for day signatures the same signature is from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; read out . for each day you use different signatures , as with the random signatures you create unique emails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ trl ; N File New . this will give you an empty string ; in the Sig@@ natures section . click on the &amp; lt ; empty signatures ; and insert your new signature in the lower section . Sig@@ nature @-@ example Kon@@ qi @-@ qi @ k@@ de@@ .org htt@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ de@@ .org If you have entered your signature , save it with C@@ trl ; S file saving or click the Save icon .
you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mails personally or professionally , there are always plenty of signatures .
to delete a signature , select it first and then Remove from the File menu or click the red cross button in the toolbar .
opens the dialog for short@@ cuts . here you can select short@@ cuts for menu entries . to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click the user defined button on the bottom right @-@ hand side and enter the new short@@ cut by pressing the button or key combination .
for the use of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; k@@ de ; 3.5 required . to attach signatures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program like &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature from the output of a command .

version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration into &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; all of these tools use Kom@@ mander as surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a base . the combination results in fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
everyone who has worked with the k@@ de @-@ documentation knows my pro@@ c and how outstanding it is . let &apos;s raise it a bit , give it a graphical interface ! no more dependent on a terminal ; simply click on the symbol for the XML processor and finished !
this application expects a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is found in the native work folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and specify the folder you want in the other folder .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files are deleted every time mein@@ pro@@ c is started .
as I said before , everyone who has worked at the k@@ de @-@ documentation knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there is now a great graphical interface for it .
if the currently opened file is inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book , then simply select the current working folder . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is located .
when it comes to an output on the screen , its file is defective . please check the reported bugs and try again .
if the file to be checked is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , then it is easy to drop the current file . if not , delete the file in the current file and select the file to be checked by other file - file cho@@ oser .
if you just want to know if the well @-@ formed file is well @-@ formed , click the Well @-@ formed Check selection .
to use a &amp; D@@ TD ; which is specified in the &amp; D@@ TD ; file select &amp; D@@ TD ; ( Internal ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; file selection . both for the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema and for the Relax@@ NG review is the definition of the definition UR@@ I ; file selection required .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; also has an &amp; X@@ SL processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us has already been selected , then it is easy to select the current file . if not , remove the selected file and select the file to be processed using the other file cho@@ oser .
enter the name of the file named as the result . the file is normally stored in your home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even possibly little to do . this makes the plug @-@ in system very powerful . you can immediately benefit from the additional functionality and do not have to wait until someone builds the fake in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; plug@@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements . find out more about it below .
to install a plugin or a part , we start working with the Edit Plugins section . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog allows you to manage all contained plug@@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often work on a project several people in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the user &apos;s nick@@ name and is used to uniqu@@ ely identify .
one member can have several roles in the project , as both team leader and sub @-@ project leader .
the user can select from the list of team members who he is . this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identi@@ ties ) appears rich after you are : text .
nick@@ name and the setting of your own identity are important with regard to messages and ann@@ ot@@ ations . see for further information on comments .
in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by cap@@ turing the members of the team : an event can be created for information to the team leaders when something particular happens . see for more information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something particular happens within the project . an example would be the recording of opening and closing the project so that later on , how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that plays a file into CVS as soon as it is added to the project , etc ;
on the event configuration page of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the add@@ res@@ sees selected in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see may be a team or sub @-@ project manager . see if such conductors will be set up .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
notes to be entered is simple . you can either select the comment -@@ entry from the editor context menu or enter the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment area followed by comment text .
notes can be sent to a specific member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) is part of the project from the following possibilities : team leader , Sub@@ project Manager Fol@@ lowing the area and sub @-@ project leaders , the appropriate range or sub@@ project names should be given , as shown in the following examples below .
nick@@ names and roles names are independent of upper or lower case letters , but spaces around the brackets and the : make the comment invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for script and format@@ ting languages that is D@@ TD @-@ agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the other can be found in .
the settings can be set up using Qu@@ anta . this dialog extends over a number of pages that are treated one after the other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags including car completion can be modified with it . the entries are :
large / lower@@ case of tags : large / lower@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal bulk / lower@@ case means the tags are inserted as they are described in tag XML files .
large / lower@@ case of attributes : large / lower@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal / lower@@ case means the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tag XML files .
optional tags automatically include : if checked , it is inserted for tags , for which the closing tag is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ;
not include optional tags automatically : as above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags .
automatically update the start and end date : if enabled , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic translation of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the corresponding coding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : types of expression for recognition of different types of files . using the Standard Res@@ et button , the default settings can be restored .
standard character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise than with file opening opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be b@@ yp@@ assed ) . this setting here is however ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties in case a project is loaded .
standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD is not recognized . however , this setting is removed from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regularly creates backup copies , so that in case of a power failure or crash at the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . even for un@@ saved documents , a backup is created regularly , according to the set time .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in a separate view ( or the documentation in a flash@@ light ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , the preview and the source text at the same time .
reset the window settings to the default when the user interface is changed by changing the M@@ DI modes and do@@ cking / app@@ ending views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ etting command line parameter .
the warning message area is used to control the possibility to switch the display of warnings by hooks out of non @-@ poll@@ uting .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be used to display symbols instead of scripts , as well as the V@@ PL@@ - and source code synchronization behaviour in shared mode . see the different modes .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the mapping of the par@@ ser nodes in the document , can be set in details .
in the mouse click on the structure tree , it is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse button .
in the area of structure tree settings , the visibility of nodes in the tree can be adjusted automatically when editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree . empty nodes are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are such , where no element has been found in the current document .
the area for setting abbrevi@@ ations ( a type of template ) that un@@ folds when editing to a larger text . abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means there can be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ clause ab@@ dic@@ ation means something else than in a group valid for Javascript .
plug@@ ins are K@@ Part @-@ applications from the third page , which can be re@@ used by any part @-@ enabled application , best known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is passed to the plug @-@ in at startup , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
load component in &quot; Read @-@ only &quot; mode : check if the plugin is denied loading . only Read @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected .
check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled , test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the entered information is correct . select to save the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it will be later installed .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting was completely re@@ developed . support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger was set , as well as support for the DB@@ G Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a Deb@@ ug@@ ger Plugin concept was implemented that allows different implem@@ entations via plug @-@ ins .
currently only a plugin is available , the support for using &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inserts .
using the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plugin in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger @-@ Plugin selection box , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; user interface :
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view in which all holding points are listed with line numbers and conditions . usually appears in the bottom dock .
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the bottom dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if required , is produced , or it tells the plugin to listen to de@@ bug@@ ging requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that normally does not have to be taken care of .
the counter@@ part to Deb@@ ug@@ ger session starts the session . includes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or ends the listening to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to request a de@@ bug application . this is equivalent to using a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger display view .
instruc@@ ts the Deb@@ ug@@ ger to start exec@@ uting the script and continuously send information about the monitored variables and the current line . if this happens , while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if this happens before a de@@ file request has been started , the script will start with the request .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to the monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens , while a script is stopped , execution continues . if this happens before a request is made , the execution starts as soon as a request is made .
the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script without entering the functions or include .
the Deb@@ ug@@ ger exec@@ utes the next statement in the script , where possible in functions and include is pur@@ ged .
instruc@@ t the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the instruction and go to the next one as if it were not the current one .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered , which is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
this dialog can enter a variable or set a new value of a variable .

this chapter describes how to adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us to your needs and how to help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; help to become better .
document type Edi@@ ting packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provide support for brand and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; they allow &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; their simplicity and flexibility power from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s exist in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages respectively &amp; CSS ; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two parts , the tag folder and tool@@ bars . tag folders contain two file types , the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files with extension .@@ tag@@ . Tool@@ bars are handy , symbolic buttons of image buttons ( above the editing window ) , inser@@ ting text and instructions faster into a document than a user ever could .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see for details on conversion .
this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ day ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and the content of the Properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the tag . file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; itself . tool bars allow a fast insertion of tags into a document without the risk of typing error .
tag folders are nothing but folders . they contain only the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders bear the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing but a single element type above itself .
the type of tag is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type method . specifies the name of the class where this method belongs to . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common @-@ attribute @-@ group and the attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only be used once for each attribute . it specifies the name and type of the attribute . additionally , it contains other tags that describe how to display this attribute , etc ; this is a single element type element .
specifies the source code used for filling for attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to reach the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and method name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag that groups together the elements of a list . it can only occur once for an attribute description . it is a single element type element .
specifies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each and lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tag to be defined . this element is a single element type .
specifies a list of elements that end a tag . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ ged XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces influence nothing , but pay attention to &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , and lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; . this will not cause a burst , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions .
this function is currently not available . currently , the check takes place only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
the following is an example of a family of 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the file name for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the file name of this Tag@@ XML file is to be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; function &quot; re@@ turn@@ Type = &quot; void &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as easy and there is an editor for it , accessible via D@@ TD Edit D@@ TD settings . this can be edited for a file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should be created a simple descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = User 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD specification . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with Settings ... to create . click New Action leads to the same dialog :
the keyboard short@@ cut assigned to this action . by clicking on the User Language button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ einer the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed .
the simplest actions . you can enter a text in the Det@@ ai@@ ed Settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text will be inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that modify the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) can be started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even are the quick start dialog or the different See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . In this way , $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in command line :
% f : we are replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name will be removed .
% p@@ id : is replaced with PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us process . if only one instance runs , the text unique is added to the PID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document , or the path to the project file .
in addition to the above mentioned methods , a script can be provided by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in the input field input can be specified , which is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed according to the input . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the default output ; error messages are passed to the standard error output . it can be specified , which should be done with the text written to the standard output , by setting the value of the selection box output :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create an own toolbar for each group . in the given case , it is not too many , so you can create a toolbar with the name of the mark@@ up .
once a toolbar has been added , you need to add and configure actions .
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . pressing the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
complete all necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool bar .
complete all and , if the tag has attributes and you plan to use them , enable dialogue &quot; Edit day &quot; when available so that an input is possible when using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? let us replace it before we have trouble .
to create a symbol that represents the action better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics More Programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ currently ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixel by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others .
please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to the fact that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green will usually appear as loose , stiff , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking this symbol will insert ; start ; -@@ tag in the current document will be inserted .
after creating the symbol , it still needs to be connected to the action . this is done through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the Apply button and continue with other tags , so there are still some , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; add functions to the tool bar or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview by some separ@@ ators . open the tool bar set up dialog on Settings tool bar . make sure the tool bar you want is selected .
I would like to select the separ@@ ator ( at the top left ) for my toolbar . after selecting the element that should be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the toolbar .
for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or Pre@@ view . I will select it and add to the toolbar .
please note how the separ@@ ators support the group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my toolbar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new toolbar has to be tested by tri@@ mming all the symbols to make sure everything works .
after New@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your toolbar ( s ) should be stored in the proper folder . please adjust your file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that your toolbar ( s ) will be loaded when a file is opened from the appropriate type .
perhaps the most notable expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or format@@ ting language that you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how to create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you might be able to check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; repository whether someone has done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to search for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the doc@@ r@@ c file . we will leave the first part to you , we will handle the second one here .
# K@@ DE Configuration File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , for documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for the func@@ 1 , func@@ 1 , func@@ 1 = func@@ 1.@@ html _ func@@ 1 = func@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the Tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you now see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation so somewhat :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , ... Intro@@ duction = Prec@@ au@@ .@@ html ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tac@@ .@@ html ...
note the # in front of Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known boundary for the depth of the shaft ( except by reason ) m@@ das@@ h ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top of the tree view &amp; m@@ das@@ h ; folder is shown ! ) .
spaces influence nothing , but pay attention to &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; resource files are replaced .
the content section is the area of the doc@@ r@@ c file that is used to create context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script should display the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . by selecting the function name and pressing C@@ trl ; H for context help , the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file linking lines .
a simple list of contex@@ tual elements that are supposed to be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file doc@@ r@@ c easily and save to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as specified in your doc@@ r@@ c file ) in the same folder as doc@@ r@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. what documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; repository for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; community . you won &apos;t be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the scattered resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or else . at different places there is an Email menu entry such as D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email sending , toolbar buttons with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts tree .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us users can download them . the contributions are reviewed and only made available when our team is looking for them as correct and useful for publication . to make a little contribution we recommend to sign the resources , both for our team as well as for the future users .
when you upload , you will be asked for your pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for your private g@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or if you have multiple keys , you can fill in the input fields ( the URL preview can be empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading .
up@@ loading can be uploaded from the D@@ TD D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , toolbar tool@@ bars , and started in the context menu of files and folders in the Tem@@ plates and Scrip@@ ts tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , check &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by examining the integrity and signing . in case of problems it warns and it can then be stopped . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the indication of the source of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages currently not yet available by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; however , creating a D@@ TE@@ P package can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files in tag XML format might be needed . there is a simpler way to automatically convert a D@@ TD into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the D@@ TD loading and converting a D@@ TD . choose the .d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD description to use . then the following dialog will appear :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! doc@@ type definition line : the string that should appear in the ! doc@@ type day like HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d
fine adjustment of D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when enabled , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after conversion the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; can be adjusted . it is recommended to use this possibility .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . in order to understand this and to be able to draw full benefits , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze oneself with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to bring these concepts to them precisely , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; little use .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
global elements are available for everyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it stores everything that is marked globally in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool tracks , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a particular project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions specially for the files of a particular project . simply put , this is the most limited size . all elements are placed in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ belli@@ ger@@ ates the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the tree views , the tabs with information and the tool@@ bars .
you can click the tabs with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document appropriate entries , such as closing , re@@ charging , del@@ eting or up@@ loading the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CVS commands to the current document .
right @-@ click in the editor pane to create a further context menu regarding the edited document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , edit the tags under the mouse cursor or open the file when the string is named a file under the mouse cursor .
at the top of the editor window are the tool bars of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional is the default for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of the further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , the tool bars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs .
the use of tool bars is really easy . if you want to insert a simple day , e.g. &amp; lt ; insert into your document , then click on the symbol that represents the tag . now you can insert the data for this just inserted day . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in different fields in a dialog .
the tree views ( Q@@ IT ; ) make it possible to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; navigate , open it and ro@@ am . in the display with tabs are available for files , project , pattern templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view shows all files in the project and allows to manage the files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as add , remove , upload or delete the files from the storage medium can then be executed with the context menu displayed .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc .
templates can be group@@ ed into three categories , depending on what context they are used . the category hing@@ es on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; global templates are always available , local templates only for the respective user and templates in projects can only be used in the project .
here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project works also here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information into a script . with the right mouse button further functions are available , such as starting , editing , or sending with email .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by clicking on an element opens a list of commands related to navigation and refres@@ her of the tree .
this tree appears among the other tree views . with it , you can quickly change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the application system oriented to the content allows you to change all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development to be found . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be added , edited and considered project @-@ specific documentation .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , two tabs at the bottom of the window , can be accessed through the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab displays information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used D@@ TD of the current document and all changes to the D@@ TD are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the current document mark@@ up . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; scripts that are executed give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the appropriate command displayed . the chocolate page of the toolbar is the option to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool bar with email . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; sends the toolbar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you receive a toolbar in an email , you can back up and load it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; like any other toolbar !
it is reasonable if you want to customize the place of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; files on your system . to do this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems starting from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you should check if your path contains the &amp; node ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that there is no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the PAT@@ H in front of its bin folder . the same goes for &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE interface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful features .
during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us started to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; an independent , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then should &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for this the suitable &amp; IDE ; be .
well , to the aforementioned claim must be stated that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; node ; developer community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; following , in good use of free software , the idea of Why Developer , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it allows users and developers to expand &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; so to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; allows web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ deleted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is possible almost every task .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly expanded to a sophisticated editor with many powerful features .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected to commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers abandoned the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in the details @-@ going documentation is with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; type , or use k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes each time you open a file that is not on it , and the oldest record is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . if you are trying to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
converts any special characters contained in the clip@@ board from the clip@@ board , so that they appear correctly and are not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instructions .
converts the text from the clip@@ board to &amp; URL ; -@@ Sch@@ ump@@ y , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag .
switches the block selection on or off . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift ; key .
goes directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script releases error messages !
search a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a sort of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre @-@ defined expression to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window where you can see the display of script actions and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
switch on and switch the problem repor@@ ter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem repor@@ ter is activated as soon as you change to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column to the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a click of the mouse .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries Previous or Next , depending on the position of the cursor in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu group@@ ed by the filen@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects are stored with the extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows for example to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
loads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de , and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; Projects you will find the details .
loads a project tool@@ box . these are stored in project Dir / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool bar . allows you to select the type of toolbar : local or project .
open a dialog to add a new toolbar . this creates only the name . actions need to be set by setting actions ... to be added . toolbar buttons are saved through toolbar buttons , or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbar .
removes a toolbar from the field of view . it does not delete it from your hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the toolbar , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do it .
this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team so that the toolbar will be present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as attachment .
allows to upload tool tracks to the main server , where everyone else can access it .
loading a &amp; D@@ TD ; which you or anyone else has made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format .
load / refresh the entities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; it is useful if the entities from the D@@ TE@@ P are to be refres@@ hed without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and there is no write permission in the global K@@ DE folder , the loading fails .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) toolbar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar .
allows access to the current tag creation dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub @-@ menus .
at present , this only works with ( X ) HTML D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ ting by tool bar is denied if this tag contradic@@ ts the rules at this place .
in the plugin menu the available plug@@ ins are listed under the menu items listed above . click on them . click on an activated plug @-@ in de@@ activated .
sel@@ ects the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; version .
choose the type of line @-@ end identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people using other OS platforms for developing . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
check the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; the external application ti@@ dy .
inst@@ ant@@ aneous switching between the different types of user interface . due to some restrictions in the K@@ DE libraries , the switch can sometimes need time or create un@@ nice graphics . the flash@@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or sub@@ window mode , which is the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub@@ window . by selecting an entry , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated .
enables the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window on or off .
the changes in this dialog influence every application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
set the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; k@@ ate ; you will find details .
a dialog appears where you delete entries from the toolbar , or add and modify the sequences .
this should create a help according to the context of the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter , but is not yet implemented .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project , developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom , as e.g. after filling the project name the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically . all these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties .
here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is filled in automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ j@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol are used . depending on the remote host setting , an adjustment might be necessary .
this is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . for server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
if a project is started from scratch , do not hook if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project .
this option displays all files and folders within the main folder and you can make an exact selection according to your preferences .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hook or , by removing the tick , clip out of the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be changed in the menu with Project Properties in the menu tree in the sub @-@ window profiles , or by Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( wild@@ cards possible ) , which are ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional options to the top , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project view that is loaded when the project is opened can be read more about project views .
the desired de@@ bu@@ gger can thus be selected . currently only Gu@@ bed is supported . more information about Gu@@ ild can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set using the Options button . the de@@ bug@@ ging plugin is described in .
in the Profile upload window , upload sections ( see in ) can be set as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by til@@ ting its own tree view for each profile .
in the team configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration sub@@ window , you can turn on event actions and add , modify or delete event actions . event actions are executed when a previously defined event occurs , such as the backup of a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us opens ; the last project that was opened . you can &apos;t influence this behavior at the moment .
to open another project , select Open Project ... from the Project or Open Project from the toolbar . the Open Project dialog is displayed and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us is closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folders behave as well , but the entries are not opened and open with ... in the context menu which can be found with the right mouse button :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files .
allows removal of the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button will be blin@@ ded to prevent removing .
the password will be kept in the kernel and forgotten when it comes to programs . this option is useful if you need a frequent upload of files and the rather un@@ secure password will not be available on the disk .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , many high @-@ loading profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog displays :
this is the name of the server to which the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for transfer . normally , this does not need to be changed unless the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port .
depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it after your discretion . the password is stored concealed on the disk , so it cannot be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. by simply swa@@ p the view , various files and toolbar buttons can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be saved , opened , or deleted from the Project or Project toolbar , accessible via Settings tool bar Project toolbar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us to its own way of working .
as already mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us are best stack@@ able through the toolbar . use and add differ . adding tool bars will be listed below in the Add tool section section .
the toolbar and the icons can be set using either context menu ( right @-@ click on the toolbar ) , other actions such as toolbar buttons , toolbar buttons or toolbar buttons can be executed , which will be shown in the dialog where it can be specified which actions to be visible on this or other tool bar .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a toolbar , the entries action will be removed and action processed , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the toolbar and actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings tool@@ bars ... and Set@@ ting Settings ... setting .
templates are basically document skel@@ et@@ ons , code schn@@ itzel and files for linking . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; basically uses templates such as a common file system with advanced organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any directory existing in the system into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the limitations you submit for the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; templates supplied have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
binary is all that is not pure text . it can be any file except text , i.e. images , &amp; PDF ; s , flash files &amp; etc . binary templates are usually inserted in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) .
documents can be from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally , more specific documents are found in corresponding sub@@ folders . you make a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in a proper way to be efficient . see for more information on template tree .
this type of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template but the same text area . you can include everything from a comment on a final mark to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl @-@ based . see for more information on template tree .
as the name says , these templates are used for entire websites as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive .
design a document structure as desired ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and choose File As template save As a local template store ....
once this is done , notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree .
select text in your document and click File As template save option to save as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can simply be drag@@ ged with drag@@ ging and dropping to the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used for this , such as pulling and dropping or inser@@ ting over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can select tree view on a folder to the right of the file tree or in the project file , enter a name for the template and back up . by default , it is backed up in the project folder , but of course it can also be saved as a local or global template .
project templates allow a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can specify he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or dynamically combine them with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link them with them . in addition , you can keep a few things in mind when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files submitted in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of container , as explained above .
to specify the behavior of a folder in the template overview with the right mouse button click on the folder and select Properties from the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is da@@ zz@@ led as soon as el@@ ter@@ al attributes are inherited .
this is enabled by default and fits for everything except for the root folders in the template overview . if a root folder is set , it would generally disable templates in this path except they would be explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder the bla@@ h would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder .
allows pre@@ fabricated or copied text for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a particular project and allows to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers by copying contents into a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have the context menu ( pointing to right mouse button ) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provides two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source text editor that can be reached via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source text editor with the V@@ PL ; Editor and the second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; Editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cursor . then you can edit and turn back to the source code editor , where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; Editor are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; Editor on a document , that &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green symbol indicates the V@@ oh@@ and@@ default of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . to edit &amp; PHP , the source code editor is still necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that the changes are visible both in the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; editor , and the cursor in the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor is activated , this mode is already active , the key@@ press moves the active cursor from one window to another , while maintaining the position in the document .
the synchronization distance between V@@ PL ; Editor and source text editor is customizable via settings Qu@@ anta . choosing V@@ PL ; view can be selected between synchronization with one click or automatically . in principle , the time span can be adjusted . in principle , the recommendation is : a small span for fast computers and a large span for slow .
assuming that you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to select document properties . this makes it possible to edit invisible tags when working with the V@@ PL ; Editor . the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document is created using the V@@ PL ; editor .
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click on the list allows to change the content , such as keywords on the column name and keyword 2 keyword 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons under the list . a change over the list is possible just like with the met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style sheet by pressing the File Open button and selecting the appropriate file .
the use of the cursor is possible as in a word processor , by moving with the arrows . in rare circumstances the cursor beha@@ ves as usual . text can be inserted by typing and del@@ eting by means of reset button or distance key .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way through the toolbar , as in the source code editor . note that inser@@ ting tags before already existing identical tags is not removed e.g. when an anchor tag is inserted with text , any other surrounding anchor tag needs to be removed .
some toolbar buttons , such as the T@@ ables Assistant or the Listen @-@ Assistant , are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists need to be used toolbar buttons .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for investigation of style sheets . in contrast to other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style of the style sheet can be followed .
to be able to compile successfully , you need other libraries , lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already present at a typical installation .
new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode , orph@@ aned support points can be set in a given file and line number and later enabled .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g returns the full path from a file name without path name . filen@@ ames in the same folder as the over@@ loaded period file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . for example , a file name file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ do@@ .x@@ s@@ l is loaded , the following entry is possible :
in this command , a partial or entire match is checked with a default named QNAP or a specified model name . &amp; eg ; template matches any QNAP that contains the template template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; is extended by the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file : test@@ 1 becomes &amp; eg ; extended to htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a requested fixing point must be resolved for the UR@@ I and line number associated with it . this is automatically performed when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . re@@ taining points are re@@ checked shortly after starting each run .

on systems with an installed Re@@ ad@@ line library , you can scroll up / down with the arrow keys of the previously executed commands .
several commands require more than one argument . quotation marks can be used to commit merged expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &apos; as argument a break@@ point is set in a file named &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; . &quot;
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name for a template which consists only of ASCII characters 0x@@ 00 to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a fully qualified name like &quot; x@@ s@@ l : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name . &quot;
filen@@ ame : a valid local file name on the user &apos;s system . on Unix or Cy@@ g@@ Win systems , the name may have the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; as a short form for the personal folder . R@@ IS@@ C @-@ OS systems also allow additional environment variables .
path : a path to change the working folder . on some operating systems , the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; will be replaced by the path to your personal folder .

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time had corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts during mer@@ ging .
the program used by me only showed me the modified lines , but I couldn &apos;t see what exactly changed within these lines . and there was no clu@@ e to the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . mer@@ ging these changes was a little night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , any number of other useful functions were added .
for example , if you want to compare text quickly , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and paste it into one of the comparison windows .
a function that did a lot of work was comparing and mer@@ ging folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full file browser .
this is useful when two persons work independently from each other on a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the result you expect . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; when mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and resist@@ s the possibilities of current color monitors . if you frequently need to check Ko@@ de , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visi@@ bly . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , you can see this at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side . ( no more anger if somebody changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is the same and the other is different from one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different .
if all files have the same name , but are in different folders , you can make typing easier by simply writing the filen@@ ame of the first file . example :
share folder 1 folder 2 shared folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 -@@ o target folders
the Open dialog allows the manual typing of file names , the selection via the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the Open dialog registers your selection and displays it again next time . you don &apos;t need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of differences with two files is performed .
through the Fol@@ der button ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , however , the comparing or mer@@ ging folders will be initiated . however , if a file is selected for A , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the two other folders .
when mer@@ ging is enabled , the input field is active for target and can be edited . however , it is not necessary to immediately specify a output file . you can also do this later when saving .
the set @-@ in button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can specify options before you start comparing / mer@@ ging .
sometimes you do not want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in the open dialog you don &apos;t have to select any files , you can close the dialog with the Cancel button .
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
what is the idea behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , this would be a relatively large effort . you would need to create two appropriate files , you can upload them into &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; now you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently you can &apos;t extract anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only dropping text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpre@@ ting and past@@ ing text into another program as cutting and past@@ ing ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data might be lost .
the info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the filen@@ ame and line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) E@@ ach info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , leave the mouse over the line for a while . then a small help window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed using the settings menu . )
when a difference is detected , you can see the color , which file is different . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflict in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . this is good to see in the next section ( mer@@ ging ) .
when differences are found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages , where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + e.g. white characters are only relevant in strings and comment@@ aries , for the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare isolated cases . )
the vertical line separating the binding column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line breaks is enabled , the line will be dotted with broken lines .
the result window ( among the comparison window ) also has an info line with the Wor@@ ding Edition : , the filen@@ ame and &#91; Ge@@ e &#93; if you edited the result . usually , it already contains text by automatically mer@@ ging , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts have been resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons to find the next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , each difference is also a conflict which needs to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the group belonging to the line will be marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this will also indicate a jump in the position in the windows , where the start of the group would otherwise not be visible . ) This group will then be highlighted with the color background color for current pane and each on the left a black beam will appear .
sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic mer@@ ging or manual editing ; this is only a substitute for the case that you change your mind and maybe yet choose another source . this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a marker that you may copy and insert somewhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflic@@ ted ; however , appears in the clip@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function .
note : if the sources ignore the numbers or ignore Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments when selecting the sources , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters .
navigate mostly with the scroll bars and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , page on , page from , beginning , end , C@@ trl @-@ beginning and C@@ trl @-@ End , Si@@ w as you can also be used by other programs .
in the output window , you can also use the other buttons for editing . with the In@@ sert button you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is insert mode . )
a click with left mouse button in one of the summary columns will synchron@@ ize the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as already explained in the merge section and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous difference ( C@@ trl @-@ Down / C@@ trl @-@ Image Ab@@ backward ) or to the next / previous conflict .
to copy the mark to the clip@@ board , you must copy the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ Pa@@ ste ) . if enabled , you will automatically copy whatever you mark , automatically copied to the clip@@ board and no manual copying . be careful with this option because you could accidentally over@@ ride the clip@@ board content .
line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix variants use a line feed character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use cart return + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 keeps the line end of the source files , therefore you should not use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not with bin@@ aries .
the options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically when you exit and restore them at the next start . ( Set@@ ting menu Set@@ ting up &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
( on some systems , the dialog also displays fonts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . )
if you enable this option , differences in itali@@ c text are displayed . if the chosen font doesn &apos;t support this display , nothing happens at all .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rendered rendered . on these systems , the Pre@@ ferences button automatically displays an un@@ altered color .
when this option is checked , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when the tab key is pressed . otherwise , a tab character is inserted .
if you press input or return , the ind@@ entation of the previous line is automatically also used for the next line .
when this option is checked , each selection is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . then the manual copy to the clip@@ board is om@@ itted .
you can select which line end type you prefer for saving . the default value is the generally usual selection on the used operating system .
when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 tries to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step , white characters are not ignored . even when mer@@ ging white characters are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , while others save only one line feed &apos; \ &apos; . if this option is checked , you will be treated with different sizes in the page @-@ by @-@ side comparison . if enabled , this option has to be disabled .
in the default setting , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated as white signs .
this option is disabled in default . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
search for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slow for very large files .
in Automati@@ cally advanced ski@@ pping mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict is continued .
automatically solves all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important . if you only need this from time to time then use better the functions Cho@@ ose A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the Automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments enabled , if the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments enabled .
these options are treated in the chapter to scan folders and execute a merge . see documentation for directory comparison and mer@@ ging for details .
if a file is saved and an older version already exists , the original version will be app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current running program . you must &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and re@@ boot to make the change active . ( this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally via the control center . )
the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries .
above the selection fields for encoding a short notice is displayed , which is the local encoding . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character . )
customize the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different encoding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding should be used to save .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands .
turn off this to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting of changes in white characters in text or review columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignore Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode all differences are displayed in a color co@@ ded over@@ sight column . but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files . after selecting A &amp; lt ; &amp; gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; C is displayed next to the normal still a second over@@ sight column with the required information .
sometimes you would like to use the space available on the screen for long lines . just hide the less important windows . ( this option is in the Windows menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the Windows menu . )
sometimes you look at the differences and then decide to merge the files . a simple click will merge the merge and use the file name of the last source file as default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to start mer@@ ging again , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file it is first given to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that exactly matches your needs . you can use this function e.g. to cut out disturbing parts or correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it is first given to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is also specified ( see above ) , the output of the command is used only when the line is abor@@ ted . you can write your own pre @-@ processor which corresponds exactly to your needs . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results . but for this an external program is needed , and most users don &apos;t want to program that themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l are completely sufficient .
use this pre @-@ processing command for new@@ lines to convert the input into upper@@ case letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically insert created strings ( info : / c@@ vs / keyword sub@@ stitution ) . all of them follow the same pattern $ keyword generated text $ . now , a pre @-@ processing command is needed for line synchronization , which removes the automatically generated text : \ \ $ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with sed , you may begin to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of another pre @-@ processing command for line synchronization . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing so virtually deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several replac@@ ements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the replac@@ ements . for example :
instead of sed you can also use something else such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / replace / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos;@@ How@@ ever , per@@ l needs a few details . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) is needed per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be retained for display and mer@@ ging . the other operations only change the data that the new@@ line algorithm sees .
note : in rare cases when using a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre @-@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences , you may not accidentally notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often programmers need to edit a lot of files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge entire folders recur@@ sively .
... makes a suggestion for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before the start ,
... can simulate co@@ operations and display simul@@ ated changes without actually performing them ,
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging individual files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
when three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as the base . if no destination folder has been specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically , not mer@@ ging . to start mer@@ ging , you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details . )
while reading the folder , a small message window informs you about current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folders , only the files that were compared until then will be listed .
when scanning the folders is complete , it displays &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually displayed together . you can open a folder by double @-@ clicking on the + / - or by double @-@ clicking on the object , or by double @-@ clicking the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions to fold up all sub@@ directories and open all sub@@ directories with which you can open or fold up all folders .
when you double @-@ click a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears .
the icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders then this is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the coupling action cannot be selected automatically . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed of problems of this kind .
as can be seen in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns .
in identical entries the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then folders have the same color . in folders the age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf which is only green , then yellow and later , when it is old , becomes red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such incorrect objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such incorrect objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
the synchronization mode is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified , and if the option synchron@@ ize dir@@ s is active . then choose &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist , but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as the visible file name for the output file only B ; copied directly after mer@@ ging &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders are merged and the option New file is selected instead of merge ( un@@ safe ) , then examines &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such errors are not removed , the mer@@ ging of the folders cannot be started .
while mer@@ ging , one file will be processed after another . you indicate the status column when mer@@ ging succ@@ eeds , and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurs . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right .
when a full analysis is selected in the setup dialog , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display more columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the dissolved conflict column is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected record ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all connection actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start mer@@ ging .
please note : if you have not specified a destination folder , then in the Three @-@ Fol@@ der Mer@@ ge mode C is used as target , B is chosen as target and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B is used as target .
if you have selected a destination folder , please verify that all entries that should be in the destination folder will also be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options to skip certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select folder merge start / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to select only the current item , select action from the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if the conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid mer@@ ging actions , a message appears indicating the incorrect elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog box appears with the Options , S@@ izing and S@@ itting .
choose Sim@@ ulate if you would like to see what would happen without actually making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( mer@@ ging a single file ) , a merge window opens ( note the screen@@ shot ) .
when you are finished with a file , select / continue directory merge again , or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog will appear . then proceed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; its work continues with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; click on an error , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem . if you continue the merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , you have the option to try another action for the entry or solve the problem in a different way before proceeding with mer@@ ging .
if some entries were brought together individually , you notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) do not merge them again . even if the merge operation was ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered completed . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . multiple patterns can be entered . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid wild@@ cards : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders don &apos;t have to match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one sample , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ cards : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one sample , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ cards : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignor@@ es files that would also be ignored by CVS . many aut@@ mati@@ cally created files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this can be configured specifically with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a hidden attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a preceding dot indicates a file as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default .
if the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is turned on , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default .
if the option is turned on , the links will be treated like normal folders and recur@@ sively searches . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; if the option is turned on , a link to a link that contains a link on itself would result in an infinite loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is disabled in default .
performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns . ( the number of dissolved , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files that do not contain any text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders through a slow network , it might be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is disabled in default .
similar to the change date . there is no true comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equal . this can , for example , be useful when copying the change date . please use caution . this option is disabled in default .
activ@@ ates the synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging are selected so that afterwards both folders are identical . also the results of mer@@ ging files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in the default .
if there are differences , instead of mer@@ ging , copying the newer file is suggested as an action . ( this is considered un@@ safe because it is assumed that the other file was not also changed . ) This option is disabled in the default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version will be renamed and will get the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file with the .@@ Greg@@ g extension already exists , it will be deleted without further backup . this also applies to the normal merge of individual files , not only mer@@ ging entire folders . this option is enabled in default .
normally , the folder Mer@@ ge view will remain visible to the merge of individual files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want this , you can switch off the directory and text windows option in the main window in the window menu and switch between the directory and text window between the two views .
you may prefer to merge a single file directly by double @-@ clicking . you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge . as soon as you save the result , the status will be reset and the file will not be merged again if you start the folder merge .
however , this status is lost when you re @-@ read the directory : directory -@@ Menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open , which are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a few things should be noted :
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. .@@ This is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , empty string &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes because of the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it can &apos;t be distinguished whether a link indicates a file or a folder . then always a file is accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit permissions or change date . therefore , the permissions or the date of change devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ al of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose is at present as a difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button over the differences viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part display from the context menu .
usually requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . however , if it is used as a K@@ Part , then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program to restore the missing file .
in the Con@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and from the context menu Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable when the original files have changed since the patch file was created .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; when executed as part , it only supports the comparison of two files , a very small toolbar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now it &apos;s called Kom@@ pare ) are already available . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff Tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs very long and learned a lot by looking at the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or have it to go that way .
you compiled the program from the sources and probably didn &apos;t tell the configure script to K@@ DE . in default , configure inst@@ alls in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ de@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find further information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical . however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical . i@@ F similar lines , next to each other , this is acc@@ . to this and is often the case .
the editor notes for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this is necessary to simply resolve a conflict by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . however , this important information is lost when the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information .
you can always recover a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger volumes of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is ab@@ rup@@ tly ; no sr@@ c is left ; and the text cannot be deleted . what does this mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and mis@@ ses the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild web . thank you !
in order to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
information on how you can use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of the latest changes can be found under htt@@ p : / / k@@ de@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source package .
to use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir provides the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , you should not have any trouble comp@@ iling . however , if difficulties pers@@ ist , please report to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists of it .
cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift @-@ Remove ) to the clip@@ board and delete the selected text . insert ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift In@@ sert ) insert the text from the clip@@ board at the current cursor position respectively replace the current selection .
show only differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder .
( in the current program version , you will need to re @-@ read the folder with the Update function after changes to these options . )
this also causes identical files to not be copied to the target folder when mer@@ ging . if the target folder doesn &apos;t already contain these files , they are missing after mer@@ ging . ( the behavior is likely switched off in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default .
note the buttons to select the source with the cap@@ tion A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be app@@ ended to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed when you click on the button .
in the default setting this option is disabled . different characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .

the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; nbsp ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other work surfaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu only has to set up the two entries P@@ ager ... and exit . however , if an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager was cli@@ cked , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minimize , maximize , on Desktop and exit .
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; nbsp ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work surfaces .
if this field is checked , the name of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops will be displayed .
tick this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is ti@@ cked together with name , the names are provided with folder numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st Desktop .
if this field is checked , the background of each desktop will also be displayed as background in the p@@ ager .
if this field is checked , the running programs will be displayed as small windows in the window . otherwise only the empty work@@ spaces will be displayed to allow their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rectang@@ les with the proportions of the program window . icon displays the windows with their default icon and Pix@@ map displays a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
the layout of the p@@ ager ; the main window can be determined : classic lets &amp; p@@ ens ; in a 2x@@ N grid appear , as is known from P@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizontal shows all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a horizontal and vertical row , which is very good for presentation on the side on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini @-@ program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size that can display and move windows as symbols or with their contents . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar .

this application is interesting for different users : artists , web designers and people with a visual impair@@ ment . this documentation is intended to be a complete guide to the use of &amp; k@@ mag ; be .
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly being extended with new features . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance computers .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; displays the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window is called a magni@@ fication window . the image that appears in the magni@@ fication window is an enlarged area of the screen and is described below as a selection window .
in the default setting aug@@ mented &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter as a moving pin . alternatively , you can &amp; k@@ mag ; this causes a select screen area in the magni@@ fication window ( selection window mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse poin@@ ter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse poin@@ ter setting . please note that &amp; k@@ mag ; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter . this is always the default k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter .
in the selection window mode , you can customize the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fication window and keep the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the content of the magni@@ fication window . this also goes with the arrow keys .
if you press the &amp; Shift key additionally , or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection box .
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window is fixed and only the lower right corner is to move .
&amp; k@@ mag ; owns a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save it to a file , copy it to the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and more .
start or stop the display update . stopping the update will cause the CPU time needed to stop 0 .
select the refresh rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands for saving files , opening a new window , printing , new@@ bie ( with the button document rel@@ o@@ ad in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and smaller &amp; etc ; .
k@@ mag is also known as a desktop magni@@ fier ; it is a screen lou@@ pe . you can use an area of the screen , as if you would use a magni@@ fying glass to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visual han@@ dicap .
you can find more detailed user documentation with help : / k@@ mag ( either enter this URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / k@@ mag ) .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click once the mouse poin@@ ter stays on the same spot for a while . it is intended to help people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome ( repetition rate in@@ jury syndrome ) and each mouse click causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter stays on the same spot . it is intended to help people suffering from the Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which each mouse @-@ click causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain that arises when you click the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , pain caused by your computer may also cause pain . if you suffer from pain associated with your computer &apos;s use , you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet .
to make it clear : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against sor@@ eness caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitor your mouse movements and execute a mouse click once you inter@@ rupt the movement .
if the intelligent shift is activated , do &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pause after pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the motion before the release of the mouse button is executed . in this way , you can do pulling with pressed mouse button . the intelligent shift requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click will execute .
if Intelli@@ gent@@ es shift is enabled , the shooting range is active ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing down the mouse button wa@@ its , before it release the mouse button again , if no moving of the mouse occurs .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking through mouse shift . if this feature is activated , a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ plan@@ k@@ es.@@ txt , but they can be changed later .
when the sound appears delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to reduce response time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select sound system and here the General tab . there is a sli@@ der sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten response times .
if this setting is selected , it will start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available at &amp; k@@ de ; for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program there automatically .
res@@ ets all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the Apply button , the settings are reset to the stand after pressing Apply .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first of all with pres@@ ets . in particular , if you get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later accept the intelligent shift .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it might be necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in case of sounds .
first of all you should make aware of which places a mouse click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window that do not represent a link does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use it again .
when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you don &apos;t only clean the h@@ emisph@@ ere , but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you have to take the mouse ball out . how this happens is different from mouse to mouse . however , it should be clear when you look at the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you &apos;d have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . you can easily scra@@ pe the dirt and dirt with a flat blade or a f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you have just started a move . if you use the intelligent shift , this means that the m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be stopped by releasing the mouse button .
this happens if you &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under another window manager and move a window .
the solution to this problem is that you have a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you type text , try and k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue mouse clicks and set the cursor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want it . but use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to make a ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ ke . secure zones for the mouse @-@ cursor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the toolbar buttons and menus and the title lines of windows .
I try to work with intelligent shifting , but I don &apos;t make it to edit lyrics .
the intelligent shift is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very probably possible to copy text , copy it to the clip@@ board and execute any other action , where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . however , it will probably only cause problems . here are some advice :
do not use intelligent shift if you just start and k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use . instead , drag a mouse click at one end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and then press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this will always play when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when when moving the move time begins . later you can use the intelligent shift without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some exercise .
to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window needs to be installed . that should be the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and is set up correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; activ@@ ates the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter stays short . this program has been developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome and who pain the bed@@ side of the mouse buttons .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to wait a certain time waiting for a pulling process to start before the mouse button is released . in this way , drag@@ ging and dropping can also be done with the mouse .

&amp; mouth ; is a program with which silent users can let their computer speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , dum@@ b users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation history sentences that are to be spoken again .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) enter the command which will later be used for the speech output of text . further details can be found in the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the default text pass@@ book . from the text pass@@ books , you can often select used text passages without typing them . of course , the text passages can be edited .
on the third page ( right screen shot ) , you determine the dictionary for the word completion . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the selected language to determine the frequency of each word . in addition , you can synchron@@ ize the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary so that only properly liter@@ ate words are included in the wor@@ d@@ board .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and includes an input field for the keyboard input of your movements ( the bottom white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
if you have set your mouth , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken set is app@@ ended to the memory channel . you can select sets that are to be spoken again .
with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , page word completion as well as the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page .
in the input field of the voice input voice output , type the command to call the language generator . in the selection box below the input field , specify the character encoding that the text will be passed on to the voice generator .
&amp; mouth ; knows two ways of passing the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed on to the voice generator unchanged as standard input .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command to voice output depends on your voice generator . you will find this command in the documentation to your language generator . examples are in the app@@ endi@@ x .
if this is successful , the other settings on this page will be ignored . if this is successful , the other settings on this page will be ignored . the t@@ d language service is a standardized interface for voice output and is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . choosing this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first drop @-@ down sel@@ ector in the selection of a text passage you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the text pass@@ book menu or in the bar for text pass@@ books .
with the selection of sockets , the chosen text passage will be directly spoken and added to the default memory . with the selection of Add to the input field , the selected text passage will initially be entered only in the input field .
the second selection box C@@ lose the edit window for text pass@@ book lets you specify whether the text pass@@ book should be saved automatically when closing the editing window .
the book is saved with the choice of text pass@@ book . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text pass@@ book will not be saved . select before saving , and &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text pass@@ book should be saved .
in the main window next to the input field displays &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection box , you can choose the currently used dictionary for word completion .
with the buttons on the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the name and the language for the dictionary in the input field .
select the desired language for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of each word is simply determined by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are brought together and how these should be weigh@@ ted .
this option lets you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . as &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically inserts into the dictionary , you will create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time .
the main area of the window for editing text pass@@ books is divided into two . in the upper part , the text pass@@ books are displayed as a tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated keyboard short@@ cut . if you have selected a text pass@@ book , you can only change its name .
you can either add actions such as new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either by selecting the menu bar , toolbar or drop @-@ down menu .
the sequence of text pass@@ books or text passages can be changed by drag@@ ging the mouse to the new position or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt key .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected ranges of the processor will be used .
the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected ranges of the buffer .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected pro@@ positions of the exp@@ iry character .
if this menu entry is enabled , a sliding tool bar with buttons is displayed for frequently used commands . by default , the toolbar is located directly under the menu bar via the editing window . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag@@ ging , the toolbar can be moved to another position .
if this menu entry is enabled , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with information about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is enabled , a sliding bar for text pass@@ books is displayed with entries . by default , the bar is located above the editing pane directly below the toolbar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag@@ ging , the toolbar can be moved to another position .
you probably didn &apos;t have the command for voice output correctly or not completely entered . open Settings k@@ mouth , set up the General Settings page and enter the voice output command on the map voice output . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for further details . )
Festival is a speech @-@ edition system from Edinburgh University . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows to use the festival for free and without any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival directory . the command for voice output is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written voice generator . currently it only supports English pron@@ unciation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and without any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ pair folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the following three command examples :
for the third example , the option must be turned on as default input . ( this is the recommended example for the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax is happy to swal@@ low the last character of the text , so that an additional character needs to be added . therefore , the full command is more complex than in the other examples :

the voice output da@@ emon from &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
since the voice generator setting only takes place in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use the Dic@@ ts@@ d as a voice service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application with which people who can &apos;t speak can output text by the computer . it stores a list of already spoken sentences that the user can continually read@@ out .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no voice syn@@ thesizer . a voice syn@@ thesizer must be installed on the computer .
you can find more detailed user documentation with help : / k@@ mouth ( either enter this URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or launch k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice @-@ over@@ s system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service that allows any application to read text about the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a part system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programmer ready to be equipped with their applications with T@@ TS skills . also the users offers interesting possibilities .
reading texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor &amp; cas@@ ate ; , even if &amp; k@@ ate ; embedded in other &amp; node applications .
speech output takes place via the speech speech cont@@ actor , which uses different background programs such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc .
enables the creation of voice output on command line ( or shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; help program .
in Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up Met@@ a Language ( SM@@ ML ) .
&amp; k@@ de language output service ; an application without visible windows that offers T@@ TS services via &amp; d@@ bus ;
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and setup of kt@@ ops via kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for web browsers and kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor , with which a text file can be read in whole or in part .
in addition to the bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( htt@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you will find discussions about &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can subscribe to the list via htt@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ accessibility .
before you can use &amp; kt@@ ops , you need to install and configure program speech disp@@ at@@ cher .
on the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card board spokes@@ man will be shown . see also . if you have at least set a speaker , the card board is displayed in general . see .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least set up a speaker before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher uses the standard speaker .
several speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are similar to several printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
if you click on the flash@@ card reader in kt@@ mu@@ g , the card board spokes@@ man will be displayed . this will appear automatically when you start t@@ t@@ m@@ gr and no speaker has yet been set up .
all speakers already set appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear above in the list . the top speaker is used for voice output when there is no speaker .
select a speaker from the list with a mouse click and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a speaker from the list with a mouse click and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to move the speaker in the list one line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
select a tuning type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boy and girl &apos;s voice to choose from .
when you click here , the new speaker appears on the card board spokes@@ man . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can go &amp; kt@@ ts ; almost use it . go back to the tab General and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) enabled to allow the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de . see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; to make text orders read and manage . see .
if you have at least one speaker , you can start the &amp; k@@ de language sharing system . click the General tab General to open this card . here you can set some general options .
check this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; system . this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start succ@@ eeds , the card board is displayed and you can create text orders and read . see . remove the mark , will stop K@@ TT@@ SD and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
if kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is terminated , proceed &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , if the field voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr automatically appears in the control bar while reading , disappears again as soon as the read @-@ out is finished .
with the buttons in this series you can start , cancel , stop and resume text orders .
with the buttons in this series , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board or open a text file to read . you can also switch the speaker for a job .
click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be applied to all pages .
the card card orders are only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the General tab and cross Spe@@ ech Rec@@ over there ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . first check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then select the text that should be read , and select Tools Text from the main menu . after a short time the speech should begin .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre@@ tension lines and other invisible marks are also read .
in &amp; k@@ ate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the displayed text . first check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then select the text to be read , and select Tools Text from the main menu . then the speech output should begin .
this also works if &amp; k@@ ate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
the Noti@@ fy is the &amp; k@@ de news system that noti@@ fies you of events you have specified . you can also read the text of this message from &amp; kt@@ ts ; read it .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; for example , set up that you are notified when a message appears in an I@@ RC channel where your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the I@@ RC message text .
if a Noti@@ fy is supported , a menu item will appear in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application .
the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml that belongs to the scope of delivery is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box since it can be assumed in most cases as pres@@ upp@@ os@@ ed .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of frac@@ t@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ops ; filters are not required .
in filters , text is processed before being sent to the speech cont@@ actor . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation to replace spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable speech and speaker , or to avoid certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand how filters work , it is important to know how the speech &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; program works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distinguishes four types of texts .
the output of screen readers is the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops them . if the output of the screen readers is read , the orders received will be continued .
warning has the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor gets too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after issuing the warning .
messages have the next highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg may read a long text on a website , you can see &amp; k@@ mouth ; noti@@ fications are also news .
the rest are simple text orders . each order you send from the card card orders is a text order . K@@ S@@ ay@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are meant for the output of longer texts which do not have any particular ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in queue , with the exception of the output of screen readers . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ops ; just one reading , this output is stopped and ended .
first , you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filter edit the text and pass it to the next filter . currently , there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future , there can be even more types of filters .
text boxes replace parts of a text with other text . the parts to replace can either be specified as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is supplied with predefined string translator filters , which enable the creation of chat emo@@ ti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for re@@ format@@ ting messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable form .
&amp; XML ; Trans@@ former use an X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert from one format to another format . included in the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ S@@ LT files for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; contained in SS@@ ML .
with language selection filters , you can send orders to a speaker depending on the content of the text or depending on the program sent to &amp; kt@@ ts ; for example , if you have set a female voice on the board spokes@@ man , you can read the text of K@@ DE messages about it . read more about it .
each of these filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied to voice output . if the filter states that its rules do not apply , the text remains unchanged to the next filter .
when a text order , message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters that were set up on the page below . processing by the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of the normal filters that have been set up . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the following setup di@@ alogs are displayed below .
for the setup of character filters you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern . if these patterns are found in the text , then the text is exchanged against the corresponding substitute text . upper and lower case is ignored when compared .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it only needs to differ from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column match and replaces it in accordance with the string from the En@@ try column . the list is processed in the displayed sequence from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . load a list from a file , the entries from the file will be app@@ ended to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter will only apply if the speaker for the text order speaks one of the languages listed here . click the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you hold down the &amp; C@@ trl key at the click of the mouse .
if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID of running programs is provided with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers you need to om@@ it . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID cop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you may only enter copies .
the string release filter is applied to the text only if all the conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if they match . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all text .
when compared to words , the string release filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . thus , the words must be limited on both sides by del@@ im@@ iters ( spaces ) .
in this manual you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; terms &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; terms &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package &apos; deu@@ ti@@ ls &apos; .
XML ; Trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ S@@ LT files from one format to another format . X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such transform@@ ations . however , it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility program must be installed on your system .
specify the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c User Language program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the PAT@@ H environment variable , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough .
with the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection filter you can send text to a specific speaker , which is set up on the box speaker , or to a speaker with specific features . for example , you can specify that text should be read by k@@ mail from a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text is passed to the filter , it searches for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected according to the speaker characteristics that the program pres@@ ets the text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends , and the characteristics of the speakers set on the card board spokes@@ man . with the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection filter you can over@@ ride the selected speaker .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is on your system the &amp; node ; -@@ editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions installed , you can call it with a click on the button to get help when entering .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the properties of the speaker you want . if the text ful@@ fills the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected , which best matches the desired requirements . click on the button on the right to see the dialogue box selection .
use these buttons to save or load your voice settings or delete all settings .
the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection Filter is applied to the text only if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter when apply . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice @-@ over@@ s API , of &amp; k@@ de ; with which programmers can give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD about &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD Module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesizer can use .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface of the Spe@@ ech API of &amp; k@@ de ; . the complete documentation for both APIs can be found on the c@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( htt@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications demand language output functions via the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d over the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
here text of the text for reading and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands ,
open two &amp; console windows . start t@@ t@@ d in one window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; converter filter , but web pages are not read when using the module for festival .
condi@@ tionally due to an error in the 1.@@ 95 beta festival , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone for S@@ able to work at all . you need to do that even if you do not use this voice to read web pages . also make sure that the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c User Language program is installed and can be found using the environment variable PAT@@ H .
certain characters or punc@@ tu@@ ation marks seem to cause errors in the syn@@ thesizer so that whole pro@@ positions are ski@@ pped or only gi@@ b@@ ber@@ ish . what can I do about it ?
first of all , make sure the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be corrected by a character set filter . see .

K@@ T@@ TS works with any voice syn@@ thesizer that can be started on the command line in a console .
the list of languages listed above may be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , consult the description of the syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . also look at the website of kt@@ ts ; , for information which is not yet contained in this manual .
the &apos; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &apos; program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ops ; for the use of another syn@@ thesizer , contact the developer team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c User Language program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the XML conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
to compile and restore , you need a current K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) development environment , including the k@@ deli@@ bs packages and the &apos; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &apos; program .
if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code archive for dec@@ r@@ yp@@ tion or downloaded the tar@@ ball currently created each night , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before using &amp; kt@@ ts , first check if speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your speech syn@@ thesizer . you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of d@@ t@@ ts ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is to be developed in such a way that the creation of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is divided into individual sentences . the user can return punc@@ tu@@ ation or paragraph , pause , pause or cancel the output .
if an application passes text on &amp; kt@@ ts , it can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for output . for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language English and its gender is female , this will be used , otherwise automatically the best suitable speaker is chosen . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; select a speaker , look in .
if you click Add to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the card board will be displayed . as an example , the setup of the module for Festival Interactive will be shown in the following . details on the modules can be found here .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is included in PAT@@ H , you only need to enter the festival .
select the character encoding for text that is passed to festival . for voices , which are known , this setting is done automatically . generally , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders you set the volume , speaking speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some controllers and display them gray , the voice you selected does not allow these settings .
some voices such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need several seconds to be loaded because of their size . if you select this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( for larger memory consumption ) the first set is syn@@ thes@@ ized faster .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or don &apos;t forget to click Apply . ) .
if this check box is selected , the program window is displayed at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the t@@ m@@ gr icon in the system section is visible after the start , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr still does not run , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this gives you the possibility to stop reading or otherwise control it .
here are all jobs listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the currently processed set . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID column on the card board spokes@@ man .
with the buttons in this series , you can go back or forth in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sentences ) .
with a click on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other cards ) are taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is reduced to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click the Audio tab Audio . see also .
only text orders are listed and managed here . outputs of screen readers , warnings and messages are not displayed . for more information about the types of news from &amp; kt@@ ts , please refer to .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the corresponding audio module or frac@@ t@@ ts ; can not load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ C@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the speaking speed here . 50@@ 1 ; % equals about half and 200@@ cc ; % approximately the double normal speaking speed . to make these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click Apply to take over the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you must find out for yourself which device works with you . in case of doubt , select Standard .
on this card board you can set up special actions which are always executed when the text order is interrupted from a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of speech jobs :
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops them . after the output of the screen reader is read , the retained jobs are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next highest priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
messages have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that reads messages . if you &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a website , you can talk to &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who is just entering the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output to the queue .
this audio file is then played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound and introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card are only valid for normal text orders . there are no special actions for messages , warnings and the output of screen readers if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; read the Noti@@ fy messages , start t@@ t@@ m@@ gr and click Noti@@ fications . the card alert noti@@ fications appear .
check this check box to enable the read out of &amp; k@@ de . if this setting is not checked , the other settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; do not read al@@ erts .
if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications with which a sound is played are not read .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click on the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and event you want to add to the list .
this event will read the message , the &amp; conversation ; sent if someone in an I@@ RC message men@@ tions your nick@@ name .
all events for which nothing else is specified in the list are ignored .
use this check@@ box to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; to do when an event hits . you have the following choices :
if you have selected custom text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter here the properties of the desired speaker . default sel@@ ects the speaker , which is shown in the list on the card board spokes@@ man as the top entry .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a specific event of a particular application , the action will be executed . otherwise , the action will be carried out for all other events of the particular application .
the event All noti@@ fications for the Application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . you can specify the noti@@ fications as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for noti@@ fications in a file . use the Load button to load stored settings from a file . the loaded events are merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all noti@@ fications are deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains brands for controlling voices , speaking speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . also marks for controlling the pron@@ unciation of for example abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W3@@ C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions exist :
you need to install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) since this is the default voice that the festival uses in the output of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ nbsp ; % , the SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously .
&lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; !

there are two types of filters - normal filters and set @-@ limits detection filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . this enables &amp; kt@@ ts ; this can be quicker with the reading , since only the first set has to be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text order . this allows you to skip or stop orders on the card board , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not directly support this .
here you see the punc@@ tu@@ ation detection filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; a set limit detection filter is automatically set up as a default . you can change its settings or add other punc@@ tu@@ ation detection filters , but beginners will be dep@@ rec@@ ated .
the easiest way to learn the setup of the speaker selection by trying . turn off the speaker selection and select text to read . switch on the speaker selection , change some properties and check how to set up the speaker . of course , you have to set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then you can start reading faster , since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can take very long
you can pause or cancel text orders on the card board , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal set limit detection filter is automatically set up if you start t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it can not be switched off , only removed . do not change anything on this filter unless you know what you are doing .
punc@@ tu@@ ator recognition filters compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ positions and add a tab character ( decim@@ al code 8 ) to the pro@@ posi@@ tional boundaries ( tab characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ notify ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen readers .
if you have removed the normal punc@@ tu@@ ation filter by mistake , you can insert it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ts .
the box selection box allows you to over@@ ride the language settings for the application .
use of the standard speaker ( the top priority on the card board speaker ) . in other words : no speaker properties are specified .
use the most appropriate speaker that has all the features of a furnished speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker settings , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; select this speaker . otherwise , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker that is most likely to match the originally set properties .
select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the properties of the subscri@@ ber you want . if this property does not play a role , do not enter anything .
select this check box if the property should have priority over other properties . you can also set multiple marks here .
since the language is a critical factor when publishing the output , it is always treated as a primary property . you will rarely use this feature . the only case in which you may want to specify the language attribute is above if you know that a particular application text is sent in another language other than the language set in the working environment .
to delete all the features in the speaker area , which is most likely to delete the following , click on the default speaker , and then use the speaker , which is most likely to follow the following .
in this case , 0 stands for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number the input 0 is required ) .
kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr soon crashes when it is started . I have compiled Deb@@ ug support , but I do not get any trac@@ eability .
for G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x , you need to pre @-@ register G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not solved , a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer .
the audio output over AL@@ SA doesn &apos;t work if I play music simultaneously with another application . when I receive a text order , freezes &amp; kt@@ ts ; a . on the &amp; console ; a message that says : un@@ able to open PC@@ M .
there is a problem on your system that conflicts occur at AL@@ SA , which prevent simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . you can find hints for possible solutions on the website of the AL@@ SA @-@ project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I loaded an additional voice for festival from the internet . I installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr shows this voice not .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int / Vo@@ ices . as a guide , you can use the other entries . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the URL ; where you have found the voice , to the developers .
in order for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and be discover@@ able via the environment variable PAT@@ H . some Syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ Module such as Festival Interactive offer even on the card board for speaker installation a setting for speed . depending on the selected voice it is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speaking speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ read . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for conversion of &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML converter filter , and set the speaking speed up .
I don &apos;t make it that websites are read with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the websites with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta the Tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . so that festival does not produce errors , the x@@ s@@ l file re@@ jects the GEN@@ DER @-@ Tags for converting SS@@ ML into S@@ aber . the same also applies to the VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added a character set filter and now I can go in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more set @-@ up or go back . on the tab , orders are displayed , the order is just one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
you are not allowed to filter punc@@ tu@@ ation marks ( dot , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . instead , use a filter for punc@@ tu@@ ation detection instead .

some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts in audio output . if your system also counts , you cannot simultaneously play music and read a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you stop a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) website .
as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de doesn &apos;t support real p@@ auses . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current sentence is still read before .

have you downloaded the tar@@ ball ( tar @-@ packed archive ) , log in as a normal user and un@@ pack the tar@@ ball into an appropriate folder . go to this folder and enter the following commands :
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least only created on request .
the following modules for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have a runtime @-@ dependence of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the Deb@@ ian distribution guidelines ) . the configure option column to turn the build displays the configure parameter which causes the passing of the output .
default is &amp; kt@@ ts ; installed in / opt / k@@ de@@ 3 . if this folder is not specified in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify --@@ pre@@ fix = destination . for example
on Deb@@ ian systems , / usr / local is the proper folder for programs translated from sources .
CD k@@ de@@ kun@@ k kt@@ ts@@ d &gt; in@@ st @-@ apps make -@@ f Mak@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ c@@ vs . / configure cd script make su make install
before using the syn@@ thesizer , first check if your syn@@ thesizer works properly . follow the instructions you received with the syn@@ thesizer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , whose source code is obvious . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are multiple voices and languages supported . with many voices you can adjust volume , speaking speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ops .
you must install at least one language . help is found in the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on .
this voice requires Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or newer . the voice is still in an early stage . un@@ pack the software in festival / li@@ b / vocals / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phones . choose a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding , such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , visit the festival as the first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to a 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic like ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; syn@@ thesizer . then Festival takes on le@@ x@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; it generates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from
please note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; not a complete language output system . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generated voice from di@@ ph@@ onic files . you need additional software to create this di@@ ph@@ onic . Festival generates these files from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also generate di@@ ph@@ onic from German lyrics . more information can be found here .
in this process , additional wra@@ pper code to festival is added to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices to voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files are not installed in the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder but in the folder festival / li@@ b / .
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of the festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices . required is either festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival of
instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you have downloaded .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center , allowing management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a unified , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center .
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings are displayed at &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the network settings module ( k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ d.@@ conf is not able to install . physical devices and their drivers need to be installed and configured in a functional way , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all shows and allows setting of the network properties .
in most cases , drivers for the network hardware and other devices are installed and set up . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adap@@ ting the following files according to the kernel version :
the network settings module is loaded when the option Network settings is selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index . when the module &apos;s network settings are started , this attempts to automatically detect the platform used on the system .
if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which best matches the distribution and the level of release . by selecting the setting non @-@ again questions , the definition can be made permanently .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are gray , meaning the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . in the system management mode , you can access the system management mode at the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
the entire functionality of the module is available in the system management mode . it is divided into three tabs :
the Ri@@ der network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be carried out by the Ri@@ der network interfaces :
the settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button interface ... to be edited in the Device Dialog .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to open the dialog with further options .
with the option Automati@@ cally select TCP / IP settings from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system will also be done with the start of system services . the DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server will send all necessary TCP / IP information at each system startup , so no further setting is required . in the selective list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
the manual can be selected without dh@@ c@@ p or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP configuration . in the IP address input field , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the net@@ mask input field , the sub@@ net mask must be specified .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is un@@ welcome , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . ping in the &amp; console ; you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in case of doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or turned off as needed . switching on a switched network device is enabled by selecting from the list and clicking on Interface ....
network devices can be activated or turned off as needed . switching off an activated network device can be de@@ activated by selecting from the list and clicking on Interface ....
specifies the host &apos;s IP address in the local sub@@ net that communic@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with hosts in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected .
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer calls htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS will resolve this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution calcul@@ ator part of the tabs name resolution allows easy administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or altered . DNS records can be sorted by selecting an entry and listing or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the Hin@@ du or Her@@ on buttons in the priority list .
by clicking the button Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog .
first you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... It will display the Edit dialog .
the list of names known by name specifies host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used when bo@@ oting when there are no DNS servers available . in small , remote networks , it can replace DNS servers .
typically , the list includes some known hosts some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv@@ 6 addresses . this still in the test version of IP will replace version 4 in the future .
enter the IP address of the known host and click Add .... The New Ali@@ as dialog will be displayed .
enter the name of the known host and click the Add button . if the familiar host has multiple alias names , de button Add multiple times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry from a name known by name from the list and select Edit .... The Modi@@ fied Computer dialog will be displayed .
it can be executed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the Network settings module are not effective immediately in the system . in order to activate the changes , you need to set the following command .
the home page of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ d.@@ conf is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) , if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the ready @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool with a graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution can be used .
in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but additionally the development packages are needed with libraries and other things .
this is recommended for experienced users only . however , it is not difficult to compile and compile . the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given , and in the second section all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ s.@@ conf may be discussed .
this section cannot replace advanced knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC is medi@@ ated into a small ( home ) network .
IP networks are currently being operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv@@ 4 ) . IPv@@ 6 has never found great dis@@ semination . IPv@@ 6 is expected to be implemented in the near future .
one of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; Work@@ place , the network administrator is the point of contact which is valid for a valid IP address or if available , DH@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address cannot be chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up an own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet , therefore their arbitrary use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be made possible by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks usually addresses in the area of 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own computer ) .
the net address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in your local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to your own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circuit .
in this part are the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ d.@@ conf and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynamically changed in DSL connections , so it won &apos;t be surprised if another content is found there in the case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is random@@ ly sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE . another level than expected may therefore occur .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar , which also offered the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective packing . the second goal was to answer a question my wife asked : how much longer does it take if you secure ?
before a tape can be used it must be engaged in &amp; dat ; it can happen in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; re@@ charges the tape and reads the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . detects &amp; k@@ dat ; don &apos;t know the front credits on the tape , you will be asked if the tape should be format@@ ted .
recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; the pr@@ elo@@ ad , searches for the appropriate index on your disk . if it cannot be found , you will be asked if the tape index needs to be recre@@ ated .
when everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the volume of the tape can now be searched by folding the entry for the tape .
prior to ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; there is a change of symbol for the tape to see that the integration for the tape has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without any danger .
before a band of &amp; dat can be used it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat ;
a tape card must be format@@ ted before you can use it to save data . this process does not correspond to format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; it must be format@@ ted before using the tape . floppy disk drives usually require format@@ ting of tape , but DA@@ T drives do not .
after entering the tape name and the capacity goes &amp; k@@ dat ; with the format of the tape . all the data on the tape is lost ! after completion of the format process , the tape is automatically integrated and ready to use .
before you start the backup process , you must select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder is backed up .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select Save ...
once the backup is initiated , the dialog opens for backup . in this dialog , you can check the selected files again and change the backup settings .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog box appears . the dialog displays the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
select the files in one of the archives for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
right @-@ click in any of the archives and select the menu item to check ....
once the check process has been started , the dialog will appear for review . in this dialog , you can check your selection again and change the work folder for review .
if you have confirmed the check settings , the dialog will appear . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before initi@@ ating the restore , the files you want to restore must be selected . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in any of the archives belonging to the tape drive . it will only restore the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right @-@ click a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore from the File menu ....
once the restore process has been started , the dialog will appear for recovery . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the work folder for recovery .
if you have confirmed the restore settings , the dialog will appear . this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and time remaining .
sometimes it is necessary to re @-@ create the index file by means of the band content . this process will delete all existing index files for this tape . you can create the index in two ways :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can set the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder where the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected folder .
for all folders listed under backup files , only the files located in the same file system are backed up as folders . folders located on other fil@@ es@@ ystems can be entered separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independently from the others .
perform incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snapshot file before calling tar . this will cause all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file will be created for the next backup .
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
you can set up the settings via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape device .
is this setting active , transmitted &amp; dat ; before the tape is mounted the command mt load to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before read or write operations can be performed .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; to lock the ej@@ ection at the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives .
if the option is enabled , the tag is automatically dis@@ car@@ ded when it is deleted . do not use this option for floppy em@@ bedding .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you must notify &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape is format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only occupy one block of memory on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , with the host@@ name being the full name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the period in which the tape was format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the rest of the files on the tape are tar archives , which can be administr@@ ated directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is mounted .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; Viewer for System Log@@ s . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system leaves the different protocol files . in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users allow quick access to , for example , information about problems appearing on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the log files of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system leaves the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; hence attempts to provide some advanced functions with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated .
the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ esystem log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other features are also included and will be explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the screen@@ shot below , we provide &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions with which the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can be easily filtered and sorted . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after startup , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - is not displayed , and it opens instead of a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very likely not started with system administrator rights . the protocol files are usually found under Linux in / var / log , for the normal user usually do not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criterion or entered string . add a string to the filter bar . in the default setting , the selection box next to the filter will display the Show All . then a record line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is contained in one of the columns .
you can of course select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term is then matched only with the entries in the selected column . for example , in the protocol file , select the process column , and then enter the name of a process in the filter bar , and then show &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to see the important protocol lines . protocol lines of the level error are displayed with a more con@@ spic@@ uous color as protocol @-@ lines of the level indicator . the colored representation of log lines can be switched to setup dialog .
if you only want to display a specific process ( for example in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can use the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . for example , this can be useful if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
in addition , you can activate the Add to new lines in the main window context menu to display all new incoming log lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows you to display multiple log files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage extra windows . as soon as you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log from the menu to view .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website to htt@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find more current information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; you can also find in the following folder of the &amp; node ; -@@ Subversion archives : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , more known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the System V In@@ it quickly becomes the standard for controlling the program start @-@ up in the Linux &amp; Linux system ; this is because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD ini .
I will not go further into historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know anything about myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary is below / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and re@@ format@@ ting . the &amp; Linux kernel looks first under / etc after an in@@ it file . therefore , you need to make sure that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically you need a script for every system service that you want to run when you boot the system or when you switch to another running level . system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is started only once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is actually not much use for it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port .
the kernel looks for in@@ it at different places and starts the first it finds .
the default running level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably notice that the default running level 3 is . if you want to change this , then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you have mess@@ ed up something , then you can fix it by re@@ bo@@ oting the system and exec@@ uting the following :
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no right files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument such as start and stop . you can actually start these scripts manually from the command line :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the K contains , the script is called stop with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be called with the argument start .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; have a server runtime running only ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc ; I could also have a user running level , &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is easy , not to say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the area of the available system services to one of the six Run@@ time to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between running level@@ ing or change the position within a level by drag@@ ging it somewhere else . this will only take place from its original running level ( or position ) . this will only happen if you extract an entry from the area of the available system services .
note : entries will be moved if you drag them to a new area . to simply copy them to a new Run@@ time , you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste them into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action .
the sor@@ bet number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service .
note : currently there is no way to restore entries that have been thrown into the Recy@@ cle Bin . so be careful .
you can use the tab key to activate the different working areas ( available system services , Run@@ time 1 Start , Run@@ time 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one .
to move an entry into another run level , move it into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and paste it into the desired run @-@ level with past@@ ing ( using C@@ trl ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the input key to switch the Properties dialog . use the Tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of loss of data , all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pre @-@ settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
I experim@@ ented with the standard runtime and now the machine is constantly re@@ started . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input key to start in single @-@ user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default running level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under running level X , but they are not executed .
if you use Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) then you will need to edit additional files in / etc which are only present in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions simplifies the configuration for the proprietary installation programs of these distri@@ butions but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution , please check if all configuration files are available that are required by the respective system service ( and whether they are in the proper directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg , Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply end without notice if their configuration files are not present or in@@ correctly set up .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; running level varies from distribution to distribution , even from version to version . if you are using another distribution , please send me information about the runtime , so that you can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read Chapter Adju@@ st@@ ment of &amp; k@@ user ;
after you made changes , you need to save it . either use the toolbar icon or the Save in the File menu .
the main window consists of two flash@@ cards , the user group and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog for user and group properties .
some cards are only displayed when you have advanced system settings . only when you have enabled user space restrictions ( quot@@ a ) for users is created a card board where you can make individual settings . additional cards may appear , if shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD Uni@@ xes .
the card password management board appears if shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD Uni@@ xes .
this card only appears if space limitation ( quot@@ a ) is activated and initi@@ alized for at least one embedded file system ( recognizable by the quot@@ a user / quot@@ a group file on the file system ) .
these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current file system is selected with space limitation using the file system .
the groups that belong to the user can be found in the Pri@@ mary Group field . furthermore , the user can become a member of other groups by marking them in the large field .
the Properties dialog of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the User or Group menu or click the matching Add button on the toolbar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group works analog .
with this module , you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , add , remove and change the boot password , add the time to the bo@@ oting of the standard operating system , add , remove , change , change operating systems , remove , change , and more .
