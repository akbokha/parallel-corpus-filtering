<seg id="1">The Language module can be found in the & konqueror; translate the menu under Extras web page. select the source and target language of the translation from the drop-down list.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated into place of the entire & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Translations are very rudimentary. babelfish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations are not subject to any important decisions, without checking the translation beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web pages on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be compiled on the Babelfish page itself, where you can insert translated texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">Package & package; contains different modules for & konqueror; despite their small size, they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some functions of & konqueror; by making them easier available.</seg>
<seg id="6">More information about the use of & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual on & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror, select Settings enhancements.... Open the Tools menu and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard customization modules from the kde; addons. please note that there may be more modules on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, the & konqueror, before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click in & konqueror; on Tools crashes. then you can view the page, the & konqueror; to crash, or the list of crashes, if available, erase.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module view filter (also called folder filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras view filter. with the module you can filter or konqueror; s current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Tools DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed web page. as a default, the ad begins with the root node of the document, example: documentElement, all other nodes are subelements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; represents a further view of objects with the MIME type inode / directory in local files. it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The special feature of & FSView is to graphically display nested order hierarchies with the help of a so-called Tree map. each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView; the size of a file or folder is mirrored, the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the entries in it. thus, large files, even then easily identified, can be easily identified if it is far down in the folder hierarchy. therefore, & FSView may be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; is an entry in the Treemap representation a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your file system. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful color and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle that is switched over View color mode can either display depth for easy detection of the nesting depth or picture of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the respective file or folder. for each property you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space to display or whether the area is to be used by subordinate rectangles. furthermore, you can set the relative position of the lettering in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">With representation algorithms for Treemaps, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. at the Treemap in & FSView; this goal is not always respected. frames are drawn to indicate the nesting of entries, and this frame will need space that will then lose the subordinate entries. note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">How to partition the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. here it is always advantageous for labelling and avoiding space losses through boxes to create rectangles that are as square as possible. the best methods in this respect are lines, columns or recursive division.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can set the minimum shown area for an entry via the menu entry View Angle at surface. instead, a space pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally, & FSView was designed as a small test application and introduction to using the TreeMap widget developed for the KCachegrind application.</seg>
<seg id="23">The picture gallery module can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras photo gallery... or by Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the image gallery module, a dialog opens, which allows you to set the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "the" "" "Title of page" "" "option allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The Picture per line option has a slider and a turning field to set the number of mini frames of each line in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">With the check box File name of the image, specify whether the file names are displayed in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the check box File size of the image, specify whether the file size is displayed in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="29">With the check box image size you specify whether the size of the images is displayed in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the dialog box, specify where the gallery will be saved and which subfolders are to be included.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Save In HTML file, specify where the HTML page is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the check box to include subfolders, you can set with a slider or a turn panel to which level the subfolders are included.</seg>
<seg id="33">Copy the original pictures with the check box to see if the original pictures are to be copied to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">Use the comment text box to specify a comment file for caption of the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box sele color depth, you can set a different color depth for the thumbnails than in the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; settings gives you easy access to the general & HTML; settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; settings can be found in the Conqueror; menu under Extras HTML Settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">Media playback for the navigation pane can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Windows Navigation Pane or with the F9 keyboard shortcut.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click in the navigation pane of the & konqueror; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Changing browser _ identifier adds a menu entry in the & konqueror, which allows you to change browser and operating system recognition for single domains. this is useful for web pages that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The default browser identifier of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a website that refuses access with this browser, you can change browser detection in one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the identifier in MSIE for pages that reject the access with browsers on the base of Mozilla. for example, you need MSIE browser identification to call up with the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not comply with the W3C standard or use their own & HTML; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identification of this outdated browser.</seg>
<seg id="44">With this option, the default browser identifier is used for all pages of the site you are currently visiting.</seg>
<seg id="45">With the menu entry Add... you can set the scope of the information about the browser used and the operating system in the individual.</seg>
<seg id="46">With this & konqueror; module review your & CSS; style sheets and & HTML; documents in accordance with the recommendations of the W3C and other standards.</seg>
<seg id="47">You can check the module website in the & konqueror; check the menu under Extras website. you can check the following tests:</seg>
<seg id="48">With the & HTML; check whether your & HTML; -document of the syntax of & HTML; corresponds to all found errors are displayed. with this review you can make sure your pages are displayed correctly by all browsers.</seg>
<seg id="49">Allows you to check your & CSS; style sheets incorporated in a & HTML; - or & XHTML; document. with valid & CSS; your web pages have a uniform look regardless of the browser you are using.</seg>
<seg id="50">Checks the links on your site on forwarding and incorrect connections. recursively all links on the website are checked.</seg>
<seg id="51">Here you specify the addresses of the servers for checking your & HTML; documents and & CSS; style sheets.</seg>
<seg id="52">With the module web Archivierer for & konqueror; you can save web pages with text and images in .html format.</seg>
<seg id="53">Press the mouse on Tools website and a dialog will appear to save the displayed web page.</seg>
<seg id="54">The web-archive module is copyright & copy; 2001-2003 Andreas Schlapbach, Antonio Larossa and Malte Starostik schlpbch @ iam.ch larossa @ kde.org malte @ kde.org</seg>
<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided so that you can connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly into & digicode; albums can be downloaded. more than 1,000 digital cameras are supported using the library gphoto2. of course, any media and card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with & Edit.</seg>
<seg id="56">& Edit; includes a fast image processing with basic image editing tools. you can use this to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. the editing capabilities can easily be extended with KDE Image plug-ins interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digicode; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional capabilities. it works fully in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion by libraw, DNG export and ICC color management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as & eg; via the camera or the lens that can be searched for.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs is also & digiplug; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of end users. you should therefore report problems and improvement possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="60">& Edit; tries to make the reporting of problems or improvement suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system. if you use this shortcut, your web browser opens a page in the error reporting system. all required information is already registered here. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digikam; is a project supported by a community. if you are a regular user of & digikam; if you are a regular user of & digikam, we would like to encourage you to answer questions to other users of & Edit here. however, in this mailinglist English is spoken, you should be powerful this language.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also digiplug; visit home page to learn news about released versions and other information about & digicode; to learn.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best way to get to & digicode; to participate is registration in the developer mailing list. instructions to log in in the developer mailing list of & digicode;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you & Edit; for the first time, you'll be asked where you want to save your images and your database. you can specify a local, remote or removable folder. just enter the path name or click the folder icon folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field, you must specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data abnk is stored. this path remains the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many files as you want. & Edit; will also use as an alb library. settings digiKam set up collections</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder that contains images as base folders. & Edit; view each subfolder as an album. no image is altered.</seg>
<seg id="68">& Edit; Entries recursively the library path in its full depth. you cannot exclude sub-folders unless it is in hidden folder. this allows you to do extra bs & digipedes; do by inserting a dot in front of the subfolder name.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in my AlbenList have no photos as symbols. you can change that by taking any photo from the album and placing it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can Edit & Edit; set up your digital camera. then you should learn how to use My Albums and My keyword list to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, you can Edit & Edit; possibly also deal with it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu Help Comparative Support.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh-DecoderSettings and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided so that you can connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly into & digicode; albums can be downloaded. more than 1,000 digital cameras are supported using the library gphoto2. of course, any media and card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with & Edit.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera is often used as a disk drive. the camera can also be connected via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& Edit; uses the program gPhoto2 to communicate with digital camera. gPhoto2 is a free, distributed software collection for digital cameras which supports an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer. since photos generally are big files and transfers over the serial port are slow, this connection is now outdated. & digiplug; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">The exif support is required by some libgphoto2 camera operators to read the thumbnails. if the Exif support is not present in libgphoto2, you may not be able to see thumbnails or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things in & digicode; is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digiplug;, KPhotoAlbum, Shovmg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as a user can. their advantage is that it is much easier, & digicode; by writing a small module to complete a function when the changes were made in & Edit; itself.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the sidebars with & LMB; remove or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drawing and dropping pictures works everywhere: you can place an image in another part of the Albentree, above the horizontal divider line or into another application window. the only limitation is that a picture cannot be placed in keywords, date list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to select the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields displayed in the toolbar at present. this way the filter will only work on the file name if this is shown in the symbol view. which fields are displayed you can configure in the AlbenSetup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="85">The view & quot; My Albenlipiquot; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos managed by & Edit are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders where they were stored on the hard disk, after the name of their collection in the Album properties or after the date on which the album was created first. the date can be changed in the properties of the album.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner you can also scan a photo directly into an album. select to scan album importing images. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album.</seg>
<seg id="87">In order to copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse onto the target album and drop it down. in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all the photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection. to access the album properties, right click on the album and select Edit properties in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album- Collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. the collection from you is used to sort your photos when you sort your collection from the toolbar or sort the View albums. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do this in the settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The Album- Date: used when you sort your albums by date with View Memories sorted by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The Elder buttons, average, New Year: they set the date to the oldest, the latest image or the average of the album. to do this first attempts to calculate the average of images from their EXIF information. if this fails, instead the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first open an album & digiplug; open, the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlipiquot; this should help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album icon, you must click the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu & quot; As album preview appenquot; select. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can always only be included in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& Edit; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the section My keyword list at the bottom left of the main window. album collections have a different effect. the collection always includes all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window provides the main view of your photos. when you select an album, all images in this album are displayed in the image window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magnifying buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album for the first time, you have to wait a bit while the thumbnails are generated. you can avoid this by using the Tools menu to recreate all preview images.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information on each image is displayed below the preview pane. what information these are, you can change Edit Settings; set it up. select the albums page here and adjust the preview images to your preferences.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows that appear. if you leave the mouse pointer for a moment over a picture. the help shows the most important features including all the tags of a photo. the screenshot at the top of the introduction to the main window displays such help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are all you need to do with & Edit. albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures in a way that suits you. image processing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them. you can choose between looking at the pictures, a slide show or the editing of the images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by clicking either F4 image Edit... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and Edit.... in the Edit section, you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos. with image editing, you can view and edit your photos.</seg>
<seg id="102">It may happen that & Edit; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the application from the submenu of opening. for this, and how to customize it to your needs, you will find information in the & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after processing, other image editing programs may cause problems with the meta-data contained in the image. some programs do not store these data when you store the modified image. thus, this information is lost from the EXIF and IPTC data such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& Edit; provides two options for rotation. the easiest option is to right-click on the preview to select and rotate. in the submenu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the filename of a photo, right click on the preview and select F2 Rename from the context menu. note that you retain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you delete a photo & digiplug; delete it, it will be moved into the trash bin of & kde; moved. F8 Delete or Del. if you prefer to really delete, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">& quot; My data slider quot; organizes your photos on the basis of the data. & digicode; uses either the EXIF date or, if this is not available, the date of last modification of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the date view to show you only the photos of the selected days.</seg>
<seg id="109">Keywords are provided with a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. tags are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search.</seg>
<seg id="110">When a keyword is selected, all the photos marked with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Tags can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your tags logically. you can also easily find parts of the tree & quot; My keyword liftquot; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. so, you can also use your keywords in other programs. furthermore, the keywords are re-imported when you lose the database; the images are noticed.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by right-clicking either & quot; My keyword quot; or click on an existing keyword and then select a keyword. if you add a new keyword after clicking on an existing keyword, this keyword will be the keyword for this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by dragging it to the desired position in the tree and placing it there. then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to postpone the keyword. a keyword can only be in the tree at a time.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by right-clicking and editing keyword in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and icon in the tree & quot; My stitch.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album icon, select the image with the right mouse button and select Set As a album preview in the context menu. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">This can happen in two ways: as soon as you select the photos you want to provide with a keyword, you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My stitch & quot; drag and drop it there. alternatively, you can also click with the right mouse button on the preview of the images and select keywords from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can choose a photo with any number of tags. the photo is displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it. in this way you can set a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was taken, one for the event in which it was made etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">As soon as you have a photo with keywords, this will be displayed in the main window under the preview of the image.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you right-click the context menu of the photo and select Remove from the Tags menu. the menu only shows the tags assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view displays a time-dependent adjudicated histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection frame can be moved via this histogram. to select a timeframe you just need to click on the lower rectangle of the box that displays the time unit. this will display all associated images in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below, you can enter a title and save your selection. this then appears in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Includes all the elements of the database: names, reviews, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and more.</seg>
<seg id="125">If you click here, the filtering is deleted and all the images are displayed again. if the search has not found anything, then the lamp becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tabs in the left sidebar with binoculars. if you open this, you will see a simple search box as described above. you can save this search here but as a live search, which always filters what you have entered as search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="127">When you are satisfied with your selection, hit the head OK and the search is done. the results will be displayed in my search list in the main window. the text box Save search as is used to select a name in my search list. if you want to change your selection after the search again, you just need to select the appropriate entry from the View list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">If you select to edit search, the form will appear to enter the search again with the search information previously entered. if you choose to edit as extended search, the dialog will appear for the extended search to change your previous search. more information can be found in the section The tool for Advanced Search.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Delete from the Search context menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">Advanced Search provides an advanced search form with many search parameters to search in certain fields of & Edit; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the search query options in the AlbenDatabase. all rules are displayed in line, separated by operators. an option can be added to the search group / Search group. each option can be linked to others through the logical operations All..., One..., No... or At least... you can create search of the type & quot; AND NICHTquot;.</seg>
<seg id="132">& digicode; characterized each picture by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures. the smaller the difference between two picture signatures, the more they match. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area where you can drop each image to find a similar. if you slide an image from somewhere along the symbol of inaccurate search in the left sidebar, it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free hand colour sketch: draw a quick sketch and & digiplug; find the right pictures. also here you can set a threshold value.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble miniature program. you can move in or out with the mouse wheel or hold it. move it while you press the left mouse button. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this of course presupposes that your images contain geo data.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below, you can specify a name for your geo filter. this is then added for later use of the list below. it works like a live geo folder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& Edit; provides a luminaire in a separate window with which you can easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L Add to the luminaire from the context menu. the selection is added to the luminaire and its window opens. when you are back in & digiplug; main window, you can quickly open the luminaire with L Extras.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview strip you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right side of the window. a small arrow tells you which copy in which window area is to be seen. if you select preview from the toolbar and perform zoo / sliding operations on one of the images, then these are also carried out with the other image. so you can compare the same area of the two images.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images. if you navigate in pairs from the toolbar, then the first two images are automatically loaded into the areas to compare. use the left mouse button on any preview image to display it in the right pane. this makes it easier to work through a number of similar pictures.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal deletion actions also work directly out of the luminaire like e.g. F4 file...</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right sidebar of the main window is available in the illuminated table for both preview images. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each section you will find a built-in swivel function, which you can see on the crossed arrows. to tanning the visible area of the picture, you need to click on them and hold the & LMB. in the Preview mode both pictures will show the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zooming is the same as in other views. just use the zoom slider under the images or Ctrl; scroll to zoom in and out. this happens in both pictures when you are in the Preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">Digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken to final output and permanent storage. each of the photos records, scans or stores digital photos results in a form of digital inventory management. most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to back up, find, protect and use photos. we focus on the procedures for digital photographers using & digitizing; we look at the download, rename, remove, organize, archive, optimize, wait and export image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital stock management assumes, indexed, categorized, secures, secures, transforms, assembles and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is in accordance with your definition data that provide information about or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to say if you find more than 1000 photos on your computer then you need to find no longer a certain photo without inventory administration. if you don't even know how many photos you have, then you definitely don't use Edit & Edit;. the approach to store the metadata in both a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searching and a secure archiving solution that you can access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you enter your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must be organized somehow on your computer. you need to decide whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc; make sure that you have to switch to a larger drive sometime.</seg>
<seg id="151">You may be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times at the same place. if you make enough photos, then you will use subfolders like & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; then export is a folder for pictures you can print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have different requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of images to different subjects and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% of archives and 5% work files will have and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derivative image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the option to save metadata in the editing page of metadata into & Edit. this ensures that EXIF and IPTC data are written into the file. if you forget, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the corresponding point in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what if you want to change what you want to change? add & Edit; a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. of course these are the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts, since you should now assign words, captions and a rating to each photo. of course you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value. this makes sense as you can focus on the best photos during the further work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Now let's start with keywords, keywords, as you would expect in other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digicode; automatically set up the tree for you, or edit the images to the right place. sorting the hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can easily be done by dragging a sub-tree to another. the changed keywords are edited by & Edit; updated while tracking the subtrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graph shows how different metadata intersect each block. this is a very rough representation since each block of metadata is in truth from many sections. filenames and calendar data refer to properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to captions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to let anybody see your photos just, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies.</seg>
<seg id="163">Take a look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it, then you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you that this is the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! you begin to dream, associations, memories, the historical period is present again, you may even hear the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who consider your photos, the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer to help him understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & Edit, you can save as many text as you want in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as labelling. you can even export it for a selection of images. if you export your images into web galleries, then these labels are exported according to your wishes in the lettering and / or the title of the web gallery system.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find another city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of spatial presentation now drives with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of using geolocation are already countless and will become even deeper in the future. I'm sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually recreate your travels using images with geographic information. & digikam; can also export kml files that you can open with GoogleEarth. you can also export the images to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the GoogleMaps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and denotes the practice of using copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, i.e. also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information in the setup page of & digikam; should be stored as information:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the photographer who created the photo. if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer, e.g. to protect the photographer's identity, then the name of a company or organization can be used. this field does not support commas or semicolons as separators.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title (synonym for author's title): linked to the author. this field contains the job description of the photographer. examples for this may be titles such as: hired photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for provider): use the provider's field to identify who offers the photo. if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others. if the picture is a bearing photo, then here the group / agency that offers the picture is given here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, even though they offer no protection against abuse. anyone who has a little bit more than basic knowledge in working with calculator can delete or change these, in the image. for private individuals, this is very important for most of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per image. & digicode; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: disk failure, disk failure, electric shocks, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, disaster prevention, lifetime, temperature, data size, spread aberration</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or a fire here. these types of losses are the same that can happen to you with traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section it's about problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTRACK, the world's largest data recovery firm, has some interesting statistics which causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, you need to be treated carefully and you can't trust yourself longer than a few years. of course, you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer, get more difficult and much more expensive. there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & dollars; 2 the piece that claims a lifetime of 100 years for yourself.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much more reliable. so it's about selecting the right DVD.</seg>
<seg id="182">75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control sums. despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there is a convenient program called IsoBuster that apparently causes wonders on CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux; however, it is not available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks, hard disks, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical Media: Blu-ray Disks seem to win the format war against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disk can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a Dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB.</seg>
<seg id="185">Do not burn the media with a description, date & author, and then store on a clean, dark dry and protected site. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disclaimers retain your stats for themselves. your manufacturers' warranties include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the troubleshooting mechanisms of hard drives: floppy Study</seg>
<seg id="187">In short: discos last the longest if you operate in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. Electronic parts of the controller are the most common error reason, SMART can not detect these errors. some of SMART-identified errors indicate immediate impending failure.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you backup the files, but these losses can usually be recovered without any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices don't matter much, it looks different in devices with computer chips and high speed processors. these can cause serious damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause locked keyboards, complete data loss, hardware switches, destroyed motherboards and other defects. so protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against current peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs a portion of the energy heat and avoids the rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug-in bar. remember that not every connector bar also contains overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, you should make sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also take care that it provides protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage can use any cable to your computer, you should pay attention to the fact that all peripheral devices that are connected to your system are protected as well. some manufacturers provide overvoltage contactors that also include a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially developed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you in a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. therefore, it can be useful to invest in an uninterruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting against overvoltages, these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs. some models allow you to continue working until the current goes back. if you purchase a UPS, you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with the cost of avoiding this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can cost you up to & euro; 20. this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it. at the end, you should always think about getting all cables before you go on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">Amazon Web Service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration you can mount it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software. Google shared storage is another popular offer that you can store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">You are compared to the hard drives at home however very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. in addition, you need to send the data via the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a common backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are fed to photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online. the professional version provides you with unlimited storage, which should be checked in reality first.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of the data backup, the web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and in the large companies the offer includes a backup and a distributed memory. thus, they are disaster-proof.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer. all transfers are susceptible to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when it happened in your hardware. all of these disturbances are undiscovered until you open a photo and this is destroyed for your surprise. no one seems to have ever thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much secure data path than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses, as they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors continue unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with disk failures on a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a license for Solaris and Leopard with a GPL license. we can only hope that it will soon be available for Linux and Windows. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has started its own initiative with its btrfs filesystem, which is still in alpha status. it uses the same protection mechanisms the ZFS is used and is also available for Linux; it is still not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss of notebook and 46% for workstation systems.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to lower damage, such as theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; for a long time nobody has been sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFs and XFS to name the most common file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process at a sudden stop during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not saved completely before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are located 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical borders. this means that while the technology is further developed there is a natural boundary for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is worse. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. even DSLR cameras require a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard disk today for 100 & euro; so don't make anybody else responsible for data loss. 6% of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year. therefore, backup your data often to a plan and test this backup before you make any dangerous like the reinstallation of your operating system, the exchange of disks or the size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your fuses on an external SATA drive every day. if, then one day, a lightning strikes you are lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes local and destroys a lot. forget planes of aircraft: fire, water, electricity, children and thefts are dangerous enough for your data. they usually concern a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore disaster prevention always means a non-local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs, into your neighbour house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as already said above is a common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic. if you have a backup that is not available immediately, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete snapshot of two times: the complete backup and the last differential backup.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. creates multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time where such a backup has been made. this backup comes closest to a versioning system with the exception that it is only sampled and not ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only copies the difference of files that have actually been changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security through ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Save important images directly after you have saved them on your computer on a DVD or other optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">At the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. any further dilution should happen manually after you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, IPTC data stored in the image file, retain associated XMP files, retain original, memory, scalability, media, reinvent images and metadata, copying images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewing tools,..., using the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable pictures survive the next 40 years that is approximately the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies to be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re-evaluate as time goes by. unfortunately, there is no other possibility than a certain vigilance forwards. every 5-8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible. the less variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should be answered by the explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone nowadays. so if you have an old system that is important to read your images, then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your storage and backup technology, or file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the expression of the ability to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing the size of the system.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have included the scalability and the area you want to enlarge to a dedicated disk or partition. at * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and move it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new disk was detected by the system, but do not hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdb / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc & dollar; parted resize / dev / sadc1 0 & lt; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of the drive if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no software that can read it, then you can create it yourself. this task will be easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard that should replace the GIF. it can save much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16 bits per color channel and full transparency. PNG may contain relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF and a slow compression. this format we would recommend to save your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with lossless compression algorithm (Deflates). it manages high-quality images, but requires very large files. however, a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative File Format is a license-free and open frame format that was developed by Adobe Systems. DNG was developed based on the TIFF / EP format and obliged to use metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers already provides DNG and we hope that the competitor Canon and Nikon will use it at some point.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML based XMP technology to replace the & quot; image resource block quot; technology of the 90s. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording, mostly in raw format, as it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems with the link between the metadata file and the image file. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put it all together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organization that supports fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include work on architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI working groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard compounds and educational efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of meta-data standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images are on the camera edium, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them to your bulk archive. this function is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a subtle editing, you can use external programs. if you edit the images with & Edit; edit, then you should add metadata again. they may be cut off from the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for copyright with a digital watermark. export them then in web galleries, encode them in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos into & digiplug; to get. in the Adding a photo to an album, you can add a description of how to add photos you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your AlbenDatabase.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; to use, connect it to the computer, turn the camera to the display mode and turn on. a further description of this can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">If you start the camera interface, it tries to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a Fertig -indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera are displayed. some cameras do not display thumbnails. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for the software application will be displayed on the camera for each file, photos, movies, music, etc.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the features and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and photo information that is internally stored by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">This information is the same as the metadata sidebar from the main window of & Edit; or image editing. note that these metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the download button and then download the selection of all. this downloads all photos from their camera to a single album in & Edit;. when downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you check if the photos were securely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all photos, you can select only the desired selection methods from & kde. once you have selected the photos, use the Download button and download the selected one. download the selected download button until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New is available. these pictures have not been edited by & Edit until now. in this case, the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window. if you select this option, only the new pictures will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">When you download all the albums or download the selected albums, a dialog with which you can select the target studio will appear in which the photos are stored. the list of the existing albums will be shown in the My Albums tab. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After selecting the destination album, press OK, and & Edit; loads the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the photos you want, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all at once by deleting the Delete key. if you just want to delete some, you need to select them first and then delete selected erase.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no way to recover photos that you deleted from the camera. you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully removed from the camera before you delete them from the camera. if you want to delete the camera path completely, you should do this via the camera system, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">The filenames are usually reused after the photos have been deleted from the camera. this can lead to double filenames, if you load photos from different recording locations into the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time on which the image was taken into the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for date-based sub-albums. if you use this latter option, a folder will be created automatically per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer opens three more options that are performed before the photos are stored on the disk. the first two relate the data about the author in the Standard auto-identity section. if you select this, the corresponding entries from the Exif information are copied to the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded pictures.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you want a different date format than the standard format, for example, in the edit field, you can use the prefix foto-% Y-% m-% d% h:% M:% S. to do so, turn on the date & time option. for further customization, read the strftime command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera file name, you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters when downloading. or in upper case, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, that & digicode; is used for a photo, is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview. your renaming settings are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& Edit; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform automatic rotation during shutter. not all cameras provide this information. in the section bar section, you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually turned on and when your camera does not supply this information, & digicode; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic rotation, use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation in the lower area of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">When your camera provides information about the date in which the photo was taken, you can use Edit to automatically create sub-albums in the target album. all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub-album. not all cameras provide this information. in the Meta data section you can read which information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually turned off, and in this case it saves & digitize; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to turn on this option. to do so, use the Advanced button and select the date-based sub-albums at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the Download button. then select Upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files you want to upload. you can also select more than one file with the standard & node; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, you ask and digicode; you, where the images are to be uploaded. select the folder you want and press OK to start the upload. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this means a position indicated in longitude and latitude and can be displayed on a map. the data can be determined by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data. environmental planner, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten where exactly the photo was taken, you can open a browser which shows the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digiplug; users who want to locate the location of the photo, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, saddle and map references. there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, via a post-processing of the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographical assignment (manual) and last about manual input of familiar locations.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few that work with GPS receivers. either as map module or by transmitting the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you must save this data in the gpx format, since this is the only format supported by the geo-mapping module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract and correlate the data of images and GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; make: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the latitude and latitude or other data then you can use this script that works with the ExifTool from Phil Harvey. it uses the template behaved coordinates created for example by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show any European maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, showing all the navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& Edit; tries to give you so much control over its workflow as possible. there are many settings that modify the behavior of Edit. to access these settings, you need to Edit Settings Edit Settings; select. the settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be displayed on embedded preview or editing image editing. you set the standard behavior of & Edit; specify when you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically written into the corresponding IPTC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface. even in database synchronisation, these data are written in the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for author's title: this field should contain the professional title of the photographer. this can be labels such as contracted photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description of the author field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to indicate the photo that the photo offers. this does not have to be the author, if it is for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be listed here because this is the image of other & quot; quot;. if the picture is a bearing photo, then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the corresponding IPTC Felder. by this it is achieved that the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the Edit & Edit database; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into & digicode; imported without going lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save image captions as embedded descriptions (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the captions embedded in the images. this allows your captions to be read by other image viewers.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse pointer rests over a file in the main window. depending on the selected option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; Edit; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which types of file & digicode; to display, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list. any file in one & Edit; Albumfolder that has none of these extensions, by & Edit; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">You can reset the default settings by pressing the Update button to the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">Everytime you open the luminaire, these settings are switched on. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is not available. the option & quot; In the whole image size ladenquot; should you only use on fast computers. if you have one then you can get better results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can turn off the toolbar if you use image editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the picture. these colors are specified here. in image processing, this view mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma subsampling, it is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for more detailed explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG-compression setting, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality since PNG requires a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option to compress TIFF files, you can deactivate the default compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it does not affect the image quality since the default algorithm works without loss.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the loss-free JPEG 2000 file, you can save losses-free. even if you select the lossy setting, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG. as this paragraph is written, metadata has not yet been supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digicode; image editing was only a picture viewer for photos. currently, it is rapidly becoming a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog you can change the image editing settings.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default acceptance is that all green pixels are the same. if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixels with odd lines, this difference generates a lattice pattern in the output. if you use this option, solve this problem with minimal loss of details. this option draws the image a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 lattice pattern with the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the Automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is used only if the white balance is not set. default is to use a solid color balance based on a white card that was photographed in sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensor has the effect that underexposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The default it is the pointed-off lights, so the parts of your images that are burned down due to the inability of your camera to look at the pointed-lights, as a rushing white. the setting colors will solve some unusual results, as they display the pointed-lights in various rosatos. finally, you can try some parts of missing information from the nicknames to reconstruct.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels generally do not saturate as fast as green and red. & digikam; and dcraw try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the still unsaturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the Reconstructing option, you get the possibility to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and can / should therefore be adjusted for each picture individually.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value according to your taste. you probably need to set it slightly higher than standard 1. this can also be done later in the Edit & Edit image options. to keep the time for the Demosaicing small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture of the partial raw data that many cameras have and which provide a matrix of coloured pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or colour design.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digikam; and Dcraw present you three alternatives: bilinear, VNG Interpolation and AHD Interpolation. after some tests it looks like this. as if AHD Interpolation (for Adaptive Homogenic Directed) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for gradient correction since you are done during the raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions how to restore it. there are also LCMS and & digicode; information such as the color information from one color space to translate into the others to make the colors as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Ask if a picture is opened in image processing / Color management module with raw files start.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile folder Sets the folder here, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC where you save all of your profiles. & Edit; examine these folders then during startup.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of the ICC profiles you have here the possibility & quot; standard squot; for your profiles. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures color-managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you use. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which do not contain color mapping or gamma correction. currently, dcraw Gamma does not correct conversions at 16 bit depth.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options such as the Soft Proof Profile that you can emulate as your image would be returned from one device. this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore work very saturated. this could be manually corrected, rather than relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obvious which color profile is intended for what is intended. unfortunately, not with the models from Canon. therefore, here follows a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. of course, this answer is inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension makes it possible to recognize the style for the target: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image plugin interface. it is an interface that is supported by a number of & kde; image viewers and image processing. by delivering this interface, & Edit; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, see a list of the available modules. select the ones you want to use and these will then be deleted by & Edit. these modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and you will also find some of them in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the Settings menu under Settings.</seg>
<seg id="324">For more information (in English) about KIPI modules, you can get through the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The slideshows should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusts the time between the image transitions, usually 4-5 seconds. the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off, which are displayed at the bottom of the pictures during the ad.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera characteristics show on the left a list of all currently supported cameras. on the right-hand side there is a button Automatic detection, which attempts to identify a camera connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure the camera is properly connected, switched on and in the image display mode. currently, serial, USB and USB / FireWire mass storage devices are supported.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom, you can set the path for USB and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage devices. this field is only active when you have selected a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list. you will need to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / ede on which you mount your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it into the display mode and turn it on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check whether & Edit; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera models and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can choose any name for your camera. it is displayed in the main window menu of the main window. if you have more than one camera, you can insert them all here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the confirmation dialog box for moving &gt; images in the trash bin, you can specify the conversation of & Edit; when deleting a photo in an album. deleting a photo and deleting an album, you will find more details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes by the right sidebar can be tacitly accepted by & Edit; applied when you use the option to apply changes in the right sidebar without any queries. otherwise you will need to save the changes using the button modifications.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also display the welcome screen of & Edit; disable when starting. this accelerates under certain circumstances the start process of & Edit;.</seg>
<seg id="334">The setting Beim start searching for new photos forces & digiplug; search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos. this extends the start time of & digiplug;. if something was deleted from the base folder, & Edit asks & Edit; you if it should delete them from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Various color schemes can be Edit & Edit to customize the main window to suit your taste. you can select these settings under Settings Design from the toolbar. a preview of the available designs will be listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs are defined in plain text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digiplug; to create, you will find more information about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& Edit; includes a fast image processing with some basic tools. you can use this to view your photos and for correction and improvement. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selecting the item Display / Edit.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing includes a set of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digicode; therefore, you may not be part of your distribution. for more information about the KIPI modules, see Setting up the Image Processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window, the file name, current filename, magnification factor, and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of image editing change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before using file saving or the Save button from the toolbar. note that you can no longer restore the original photo as soon as you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it. you can do this with File Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you haven't saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using File Recovery or button Recover the image editing button in the toolbar. you then lose any change you've done on the photo since the last save.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually any image editing action can be undone or restored. the last action can be undone by choosing Edit back or restore by choosing Edit Recover from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should use the keyboard shortcuts, Ctrl; -Z to undo and remember Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the button or restore button in the toolbar for a moment, you will get a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in-between will also be undone or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, picture or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter the photo and zoom out by using Ctrl; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the view menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar:</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode. you come to the normal view in which you use the Esc key. if you do not want this, you can change this in the Edit Settings dialog. you can view this from Edit & Edit; main window. see the section for setting up image editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print in the File Image menu and get the standard & node; Print dialog. you can customize the settings before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual images or whole sentences. entire image preview pages can be printed from your selection. you just have to select the pictures with the standard methods and select from the menu album Export printer wizard. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & Edit Pane; main window has a sidebar on the right, which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is available without the navigation file, also in image editing. it is displayed when one of the five tabs is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking on the same tab lets the sidebar appear or disappear into the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">The text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the captions are copied to EXIF and IPTC fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are converted. if you want to use the IPTC label field in other applications, you should consider these limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented, use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next image, the captions are then saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">With this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also write the metadata into the files. however, this is always performed if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The rating shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images simultaneously, select them and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written to the IPTC field in gency. the code follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword overview shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree and a selection box with the keyword used previously in this & Edit; session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword Tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word. you can quickly limit the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword. this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom of the page is a further relief when entering keywords for a series of images. if you have typed different keywords, they are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree. keyword subs all key words of an image.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree, this is only applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection, if you want to provide a selection with a keyword, please refer to the Keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The keyword filter sidebar is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window. usually, the left side bar is used with their album, date, keyword and search views. if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw and drop tags. suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it from the right sidebar and place it on the selection. then a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day. the keyword filter refers to no keywords, which reduces the amount to three images. they were selected using Ctrl + a, and then a keyword is drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks whether this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at every start of the program. it can also be turned off under Settings Diverse.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created a rule and notice that it should be one or more, you can easily change this by double-clicking on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry in which the database is searched for. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator which is a name or string already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">You can, for example, specify an Advanced search across all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button grouping. the options then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why have Picasaweb and Flickr not listed? free space is limited to 1 GB and you won't want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I've mainly adapted it to & Edit; s specific implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is the color that comes from your camera or scanner that have a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can reach that the colors on your screen resemble those of your camera or scanner and that correspond to the colors you print or publish on the web to those of your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the subject comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of the image processing workflows. additionally, links with deeper information allow you to make your own informed decisions so that you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below, you do not have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated on the sRGB colour space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image expenses are by email or the web where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB functions so well and makes life so easy for all, why should one use a different color space and have to worry about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors we can see, the horseshoe region, and the colors in the sRGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-Dimensionale representation of sRGB with some bigger colour spaces, visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent site and first click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to check my monitor when I decided to work only in the sRGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in the sRGB colour space or not, you have to be alligating your monitor because sRGB assumes that your; onitor is allibrated to sRGB. if you work than in sRGB color space then you must either channel your monitor to the sRGB standard, use a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting any further manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, match, automatic balance and contrast expand from the menu Correcting Automatic correction try automatically from your colors to make the best. you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the brightness values over the entire image so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point as brightly as possible without changing its color shading. this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or crisp.</seg>
<seg id="391">Balance: this method adjusts the intensity factor of the color of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible. sometimes the comparison achieves very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it also produces rubbish. it is a very powerful operation, which either causes wonders or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic balancing: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and light border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Intensify contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a new jib of all values in between. this is only visible in selected images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digiplug; is a semi-automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is slightly restricted since one color space is worked with 8-bit per color. if you can thus be too far from the original picture, areas with overexposure may occur. if you can do the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is copyrighted by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it using the menu entry Color white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left, both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen. the preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance then it is enough to click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The image preview features a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">The histogram is very helpful, even in well-lit pictures, most pixels are very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your score depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustments lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or also dim them down.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color for calculating the color temperature of the white balance. in this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed. you will get the combined result displayed in the white balance. this will appear in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save As and Load buttons do exactly this. any setting of the white balance you have set allows you to save it to a text file and load it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The default settings return all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that neutral settings will also result in a different photo than your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better suited for high quality images. however, this coding requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for the formats of PNG, PNM, TIFF, and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color mapping can be done by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed instructions for using color profiles can be consulted in the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is to find color correction in the menu. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time, so that you can use it for several photos at the same time. this is useful if your camera or scanner always needs the same error and you always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">This & digiplug; tool color effects provide you with four color effects, a solar installation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a canister filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, was an effect if one replaced a partially developed print with a short flash light and then completed the development of the image. this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. the result was a partial negativity of the image. this tool allows you to fine tune this interesting effect.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar system. at about 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible. another upliftment creates a negative image so that it is not possible to generate photographic paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar installation effect. the original image is the (1) and that processes the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaot; effect. it differs from saturation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simple, it embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted color film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and hence a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neon light.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photos. you can try to experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your adjustments can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result, use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor light conditions, you can get the opposite problem: one too high saturation. also in this case the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation instead of raising it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple contrast ratio / contrast / gamma, the tool is based on tone correction for the improvement of exposure. even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated, you only need the area of the slide for the application purpose described here.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph, three sliders are clicked in and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to move the controller and make sure the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right side, the original and the preview of the image can be viewed. the preview is updated dynamically, based on the settings of the image, updated. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: this selection box shows whether the histogram is displayed using a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera, the linear representation is often the most useful. if images contain large areas of a constant color, the linear histogram is dominated by a single pillar. in this case, the logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controls: the upper one for the dark tones, the middle one for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gamma values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pipettes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows, middle and bright tones. furthermore, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controls that can be used to change the output values interactively as with the input values. for example, the compression of the output values can be used to create a light picture as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and Load: with these buttons, the set values can be saved in the file system and loaded later. to do this, the Gimp Levels Format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows, means, and sun shades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The Overlay Indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, that means you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example of the adjustment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left side, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifier channel: this selection box allows the channel to be specified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Beside this box are two symbols to change between a linear and a logarithmic view. for images taken with a digital camera is mostly the linear mode of the most useful. for images with large areas of constant color, linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case, logarithmic mode continues.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a short part to the right, e.g. the bright tones, then you can see that these bright tones correspond to darker output tones and that the corresponding pixels become darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">When you move this marker to the area you want to change, a suitable line is displayed on the curve representing the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and Load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. any curve you have created can be stored in the file system and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you use this method and the three color pipettes button, automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, mid- and sun shades. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The Overlay Indicator option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if more than one channel overexposed pixels are found, the combined result is displayed. this is an indicator, i.e. you only get the effect displayed in the preview and it is not possible to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and sun shades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The Edit & Edit channel mixer; image processing is a tool to improve color channels or change the color shades of the photo.</seg>
<seg id="442">The Channels Mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the color tones of the images. you can edit it from the menu color channel mixer of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left part of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the picture, a vertical line in the histogram will display the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls for the module are right down: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you turn luminance, the image will also retain the general brightness as the channel mixer is then THE tool for generating great black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colour space. the color space consists of small noise-artefacts that don't appear in the same spot in the color channel and whose noise pattern looks different in each channel. if this is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the color space first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any blender setting you can save for later and then load. the file format used is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The Overlay Indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, that means you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in which the Blue channel has been readjusted. the option Luminance is enabled. the original image can be seen in (1) and the edited image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your ability to abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step because colour images can be easily converted to the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford Consulting 5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lentil filter. this looks good, with all scene images and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with orange lens filters. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air photos.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate moonlight scenes at daylight time. thus, similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: generates warm light and medium tones while adding a bit of cold in the shading tones. this is very similar to the process of staying a pressure and redevelopment in a sepiatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With Edit & Edit; tool texture you can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color picture or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a screen, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three-dimensionality of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper texture effect is applied in the picture below. the original image is (1) and the modified under (2) can be seen. the relief parameter has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With Edit & Edit; tool frame add a decorative frame to be added to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer in the confines of a photo is not an easy task. one possibility to keep his attention is to set the picture a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you enter the desired frame type for your picture. throughout the picture borders with a colored line, Niepce borders it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), bent around it with a nice three-dimensional frame that is ideal for a button effect and decorative inserts a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the range of values for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for the printing of the images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can insert simple a formatted text into a picture at any place. this also goes in several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text direction, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need. you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Each setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the "OK" button. once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">Using the & Edit; tool templates you can put a template over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu Image Templates apply in image editing can be used to lay stencils over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no restrictions regarding size and orientation. however, you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) to minimize the file size of the template. if you want to add your template to & Edit, simply send an email in englisch to the & digikam; mailinglist digicode-users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to put your stencil folder with the button base folder in the dialog. select the folder where you copied the stencil files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the templates, a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the stencil folder. selecting a folder automatically updates the template of the templates.</seg>
<seg id="474">The preview contains three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the picture below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Smaller: this knob decreases the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you need to shrink the image accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below the template. to do so, take the picture and place it in the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be automatically adjusted to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& Edit; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but generates grainy images, especially in dark areas.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blurry mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper. in fact, it sharpens no bit, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for customization.</seg>
<seg id="483">Images without focus as well as most digitalized images need a correction of sharpness. this is because the digitalization process is composed of only minimal differences to a color point. this in turn results in sharp edges becoming blurred. the same phenomenon can be observed when ink points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually need more subsequently than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG images, a camera is often used for internal sharpening. in contrast, images in the raw format must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners apply a field of sharpness while reading the image. if you disable them, you will get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening tool. you can invoke this with the menu entry Correct sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should be careful with this, as the results do not work very naturally: sharpening increases sharpness of edges, but also increases the noise. in general, the most useful technique to sharpen an image will refocus the tool. you can refocus more information and a comparison of all techniques to sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than sharpening it. use the tool for softening with the menu entry Correct softness and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unknown masking is a very good tool to remove eils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview help to edit the image. the preview window will display the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should be tried first. an increase in the radius or the amount will amplify the effect. if you make the blur mask too strong, noise and the impression of grates in the vicinity of sharp edges will produce.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius shows how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, you should sharpen pictures best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image one that is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference-amount. thus, it is possible to define a minimum difference thus for an edge of the filter. thus areas with a soft change between tones are exempt from sharpen and hence, beauty bugs in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the extremely blurred masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image that (2). blurred masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digikam; tool refocus refocused a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted entfaltungs-filter algorithm of Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese filtering. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening pictures usually achieves better results than blurred. you can start it from the menu by refocusing colors in image editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folding works much better than the Gauß'sche fold. the Gauß'sche fold has a very long tail, which causes the mathematical result also depends on the source pixelxes which are far from original pixels. the fin's fin is influenced in most cases even very strongly from the distant pixels.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value 1 should result in good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase of the correlation may help reduce artifacts. the correlation may be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpness effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help to reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are only rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad. a usable value is 0.03.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius of the Gauß'sche sharpness. use this parameter if your sharpness Gauß is sch. in most cases you should let this value be set to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value nonzero otherwise you may need to increase the correlation and / or noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Die size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase of the die size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the gauge's sharpness. note however that the module will be very slow if you select large values for this parameter. in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to change all the blanks, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible, but which later leave unpleasant artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">In general, weed masks produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by the blurred masking using a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Even under optimal conditions it is never possible to remove the effect of blurring. for the Viennese filter one can show that it is the optimal Lineare filter. practically, the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blur mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better when machining small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color picture that needs to be corrected. this picture was made with an analog camera. the unfocussed result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For further information on the correction data in digital pictures you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The slider controls the blurring of the area of the darkened area in order to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink ink allows a matching colour for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, you can adjust it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The image error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various default settings as starting points to simplify the restoration process. the available default settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Attention p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to an even smoothing over the picture. a value of 0.9 should keep details in such a way that no sharpening is necessary afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="520">Directional dependence alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value draws close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a movie granularity or CCD hiss will produce a high value wave-like patterns. JPEG Artefacts are best removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Flatten [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above allel. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, place this value corresponding to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary when very much noise is present, as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is going through. usually 1 or 2 is enough.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle step width da [5, 90]: angle dependent integration of the anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is selected small, it should also be selected small. make sure that small angles create a long runtime. therefore, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral stride width [0,1, 10]: integral stride width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel-smoothing and never greater than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation: the amount of quality you receive by selecting this option is only minor. it doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend that you let it out.</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save As and Load buttons do exactly this. any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting image errors is relatively very fast at work. however, it can take very long time and draw a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time by pressing the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors can be removed with Small artefacts. the module is applied in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see, there is a strange black artifact that was caused by a poor movie deposit during the trip. the original picture is below (1) to see and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digikam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts that come from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or mosireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a granular noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the subwindow of advanced settings can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time that the filter per pixel needs and can blur the image. the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus smaller faults.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel spacing the filter to the front to determine luminance changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter will not be able to get picture details anymore and noise or lubrication will occur again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong cannot be removed all the noise or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak hiss or JPEG-artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend either to change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either to change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the chromating tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically more distorted.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of the phase damping. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filtering radius responds to variations of the luminance. if it is raised, the edges appear smoother when it is too high. if it is at its minimum, noise and phase jitter can occur at edges. it can remove spikes and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are used exactly for this purpose. all the noise reduction parameters you set can be stored in the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and corrected with (2). noise reduction has been applied using standard settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a little softly is fortunately much easier to sharpen than a picture. use tool for softening with the menu entry Correcur softness and experiment with the smoothness. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & Edit; photo restoration is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film scores, scratches, compressionartefacts and local errors that occur in digital, original or subsequently digitalized images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and texture creation. the texture creation is performed using a different tool, the image error correction. the algorithm for the restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts reduce: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away from it. as a loss-prone compaction algorithm, it generates some compression & quot; Artefactequot; - small standards that can be seen in the uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The Save As and Load buttons do exactly this. any setting of photo restoration can be saved to a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo-restoration is relatively very fast at work. however, it can take very long time and draw a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time by pressing the button terminating.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can restore as a photo with uniformity noise. the module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a minolta (tm) 700Si camera on an Ilford (tm) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film grain on the faces. the original picture is below (1) and corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of photo restorations. this time textures were reduced to an old colour photo that was read with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts that were caused by scanner illumination and photo paper. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digikam; tool Hotspot allows to remove Hotpixel of photos that were taken with a CCD camera, eight were removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project which are copyrighted by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high-quality raw mode photographs, as many cameras with JPEG compression feature a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixels quot; and quot; bright pixelquot; on a photo with a dark-picture subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Load this file into the wizard with the button dark. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the matching dark image to the image to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard will remember the final dark and automatically recharges it at the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview help to correct the result within the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are raised in all preview ranges.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to view the defective pixels from the preview and the filter results. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixels. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an average of the neighboring pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default filtermethod. all pixels with a gap of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to compute a bi-quadratic surface (2-dim) or a group of square turns (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to compute a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic turns (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotspot correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been magnified to 300% (1) and the corrected image is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digitizing; vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo format, can frequently illuminate the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignetting & quot; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">Many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which may increase the necessary shutter speed under certain circumstances so that it is impossible to hold the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller since otherwise unsharper effects are caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposures of today's filmic and grayscale depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image created without this filter. the tool vignetting correction applies the transformation with a center filter onto a picture. the algorithm is copyrighted by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controls, you can control the vignetting correction filter and with three further exposures of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the largest density of the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which compensates for an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1, or randomly a light intensity of 2. increase the density to compensate for a larger degree of vignetting, reduce it by a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the vignetting correction reduces the luminous intensity of the pixels. you must adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide you with positive values, since you only have to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer readjustment of the exposure of the target image, leave the values for luminous intensity / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gradation from the Edit menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignetting correction applied to one image. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & Edit; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometrical distortions. colour distortions cannot be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree treats the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect, but flattens at edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of fourth gradient adjusts the distant corners to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometrical distortion can be eliminated almost.</seg>
<seg id="580">In general: this value controls the thickness of the distortion second degree. negative values can be used to correct tonal distortions and positive values of the cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth degree. this value works more strongly against the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses the 'Corner Parameters' has the inverted character of the parameter General.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resets the image size and thereby performs a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive the image resins.</seg>
<seg id="583">Bright: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase them.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialogue with a preview illustrates the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The hover- or cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes. best perform this correction as the first one. if you want to re-cut a picture and then perform a tonal correction, the effect would seem obvious to the falcon.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal auxiliary line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to display the dotted lines. move it into an important location, such as the sea edge or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove this with the cutting tool in the menu transformation trim from image editing or via the zoom slider of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some motives, e.g. shots from the front, frame and picture, is the perspective to correct which all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. note that if you hold the camera by hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonal correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method for simulating the infra-red film of the GimpGuru.org website which is accessible under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrared movie, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview, you can set two parameters to set film scores and film sensitivity (ISO). activate the Add Film Console option if you want to simulate the granular texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO regulator changes the amount of film grains and the dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the edited image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">This is known from classic high speed rollers such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, manufacturers mix large silver grains of photographic emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to postpone into the past. the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere of everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street photographer, grainy view especially in your monochrome photos, you need to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">The regulator can calibrate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is set to ISO-2400, although higher values are often required. if you need more grains, you can apply the filter repeatedly.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film grain effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that edited the (2). the used film sensitivity is ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digicode; filter oil painting generates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digiplug; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. nature images and style life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controls to influence this effect. the upper one selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the editor is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixels large picture is 1 and smoothing 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digicode; Filter cabledrawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a cabbage roll. the lines whose gradients vary slowly are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketch.This would be good pictures to begin with.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two knobs with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob selects the pin size and the lower knob adjusts the contrast (smoothness).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the charcoal filter filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digicode; Filter engraving shapes your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digiplug; Filter engraving is a fast tool to give your pictures again with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important in content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monstrous landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave-blocks 1: divide the image into cells and make it look as if it is looked through glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave-blocks 2: analogous to the wave-blocks 1, the picture is distorted here with a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects take long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time using the button exit.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of blur effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom blurring: blurred the image along star shaped lines that emanate from a center point. this simulates the blurring of a zooming camera and thereby creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurred the image by turning the pixels around a center. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Correction: blurred the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object appears to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Blurring: blurred the image by horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: photographing from a car or train, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Blurring blurring: blurred the image soft into the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle light.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sharpness: blurred the image by randomly shifting the pixels and thereby simulating the blurring of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blur: finds the color basins in the picture and blurred them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: splits the photo into rectangular cells and then recreates it by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects take long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can cancel this calculation at any time by pressing the button terminating.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. this gives it natural to your pictures a wet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of drops. since the droplet size does not grow automatically with the size of the image, it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use Edit & Edit; edit an area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you then start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrop filter. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the edited image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can place it through mirrors or turning in the correct orientation. you can find the tools for this in the menu transformations or transforming mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo flash is definitely one of the most widely developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of resolution are reached? how can you recover the missing information here or guess? the CTRL algorithm used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose to change size change in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The size change tool uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality then try the tool to blow up.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to increase an image. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm picture bubbles was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You have to tell the tool how you want to change the size. these settings are available in the New size tab and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary when very much noise is present, as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. each installation for photo magnification can be saved as text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflating is very fast with what it does, but it can take very long time and pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time by pressing the button terminating.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo inflating by enlarging a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard magnification for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">Cropping a photo is not only a frequently performed surgery, but also a frequently underestimated tool to put together a picture. to crop a photo you simply need to create the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will see this rectangle while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut off. this will give you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be clipped by dragging on the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle will create by simply dragging it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut, use the button The edit button for image editing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the file saving or file saving in the File menu to save the newly cut picture.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview section, you can change the size of the rectangle by dragging the corners using the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog will be preserved.</seg>
<seg id="644">According to the aspect ratio, you can specify orientation as portrait or landscape format. in portrait aspect, the greater value of the height and cross-format width is always assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">Cutting the tool after aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use inches, inches or any other physical size. you can e.g. see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and its aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">In the bottom of the dialog you can use the Max relationship button to set the area to cut to the greatest possible depending on chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The Adjustment tool stores its settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the editing tool next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data reflect the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the assembly assistance make it possible to blend help to make your pictures better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious Triangle: harmonic divides are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-rule, harmonic triangles are a way of dividing a rectangle in similar harmonic triangles on the diagonals.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden middle is a division that is based on various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden pitch is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks used to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put together your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden middle. a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides liquefied auxiliary lines when you compose a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral will bring you good results for your photos. compared to third-level gels, the golden spiral generates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this kind of composition carries the viewer's gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow in this way.</seg>
<seg id="656">A further rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. this rectangles should be used to create the golden spiral. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Triangles also derive from the golden spiral discussed above. your vertices are the center points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles are not even triangle triangles.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame, create an effect called Dynamic Symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal mirror and vertical mirroring can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the Color button you can set the color of the relief lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the guides can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo then it easily happens that you don't hold the camera vertical or horizontal. this creates a picture where things are rotated around an angle. you can do this using the Edit & Edit free rotation and adjust the finish angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slider angle. the values on this slide are indicated in degrees. with the Preferences button you can set the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are displayed on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after you have moved it over an important point of the picture, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have shot a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to fix this is to use the function transformation trim from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to trim the image is Automatically trim the function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the image a bit after the turn. note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectival transformations are performed by a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will be automatically recalculated. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty spaces created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty spaces created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle to the top left: indicates the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Corner right top: indicates the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle at the bottom left: indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Corner right down: indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image is slightly smeared. for a single adjustment, this effect is small, but two adjustments generate a doubly so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adjusted the perspective, you get unpleasant triangular holes in the corners. one way to clean this is to cut the picture with transformation trim from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The shearing tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part to the opposite. a horizontal shift, for example, will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module via transformations.</seg>
<seg id="679">Shoot your image by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle. if you press presets, the angles are reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed. move the mouse to an important point, like the sea, a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the shearing tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shearing, the picture is wiped a bit. for a single shearing, this effect is mostly negligible, but two shadings generating twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After shearing the picture has imprint triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transformation trim from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& Edit; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries were compiled. in most distributions, you will be able to edit a large number of formats with & Edit.</seg>
<seg id="684">Due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF among them.</seg>
<seg id="685">& Edit; displays only files in formats that you know. this happens on the basis of the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre-defined list. if the extension is listed in the list, you can modify this list of file extensions and Edit them. in the configuration section, you will find more information about this.</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras even allow you to select the format to use. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & Edit; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression procedures to digital images. thereby, redundant information is reduced to save image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. in general, there are better, smoother results than JPEG at the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also store lossless if specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw image format, you can read from Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful guides in English. you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter by & Edit. in the configuration section, you will find more information about using modules with & digiplug;.</seg>

<seg id="700">Many tools you need to edit photo editing are in & Edit; included. your description follows here.</seg>
<seg id="701">All image editing tools such as sharpening, molluscs, noise suppression, refocus, blurred masking, & etc;. use a uniform dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image. below you see & quot; texture user quot; in this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="702">(1): this progress bar displays the status of the filter to the current image. to the left of it, five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area. these modes are:</seg>
<seg id="703">The left part shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected area.</seg>
<seg id="704">The upper part shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected area.</seg>
<seg id="705">The left part shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter.</seg>

<seg id="709">(3): the frame to select the preview. you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to view the preview. the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately.</seg>
<seg id="710">(5): in the lower left corner: here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values. all settings from the last use of the module will be noted.</seg>
<seg id="711">The page bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self-explanatory. it is grouped in the following sections:</seg>
<seg id="712">Photo properties: displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos. these data are from the EXIF data when they are available.</seg>
<seg id="713">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble miniature program. you can move in or out with the mouse wheel or hold it. move it while you press the left mouse button. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this of course presupposes that your images contain geo data.</seg>
<seg id="714">& kcoloredit; is an editor for palettes files. the application can be used to edit color palettes and to select and naming colors.</seg>
<seg id="715">The palettes that can be installed by & kde can be valid for the whole system or only one user. in the latter case, they are in your personal folder for & kde; settings and hot user defined color and last used colors.</seg>
<seg id="716">In the dialog palette, you can select from a list of the installed trays or browse the folders for files.</seg>

<seg id="725">& kgraph viewer; is a KDE program used to view & graphviz; -dot; graphs. graphs are used in science, especially in computer science. so far there was no modern & GUI; program to visualize graphs. the programs that & graphviz; includes are according to the program author outdated & X11; - or & tcltk; programs with just a few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kGraviewer; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgraph viewer; is a KDE program for viewing of & graphviz; -dot; -dot; programs are free layout programs. & kgraph viewer; displays graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & kate; and & konqueror; (so that a change of the graph in & kate; re-calculated the graph and represented in & kgraph viewer;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graphs in & kate; to open or open the graphene in & kgraph viewer; in a & kate; component</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems starting from about 1000 nodes and a hack to represent more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Further needed software: & kGraviewer; is a & kde; program which presupposes the & graphviz; tool & dot; for the representation of the graph presupposed.</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in its own subwindow. initially, if you start & kgraph viewer; without starting a argument, the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot. in this case, the toolbar only contains the symbol file and the (empty) list Last opened files. click on the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After you have selected one or more & dot files, the main window looks like in the bottom screen shot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner when the diagram is larger than the canvas. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (up and down without special keys, left and right at pressed & Alt; button);</seg>
<seg id="736">The zooming is limited in both directions by factor 10. below you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the currently loaded file has been modified by another program, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph should be reloaded or if you want to ignore the change. if you want to change your decision later, you can change the menu item Settings kscreen viewer; set it up, see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you open a Graph file outside a running & cGraphviewer instance, & eg; in the file browser or on the command line, you have the choice whether you want to open a new & kgraph viewer; or to display the graph to be loaded in a subwindow of the already running instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but change it later with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">When starting the program, you can reopen all the graphs of your last session. again, you can save your choice as well as change it later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how the graph should be split across multiple pages. the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be selected freely.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you use multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page will be adjusted to this page. this ignores the aspect ratio. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled out by the respective sections of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with a graphs distributed across multiple pages without header and with another font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Erneut Load page gives the possibility to specify the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard disk, & eg; from another program. you can specify a default behavior (automatically recharge or ignore the changes) or ask the program every time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The Open page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of & kgraph viewer; specify when a graph is opened out of a current session. you can set a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a subwindow of the already running session) or determine that every time it is requested.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session management page gives the possibility to specify the start behavior of & kgraph viewer; you can set a default behavior (opening or not) the files of the last session (or not) to be asked at each start.</seg>

<seg id="750">The algorithm lays the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overlaps as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the default for uncoated graphs. it produces representations according to the springspring model. the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used, which is equivalent to statistical multidimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP algorithm creates a springspring model for ungerized graphs. it uses the Frustre-Reingold heuristics, and includes a multi-grid trigger for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm arranges the nodes in a circular manner according to the description of Six and Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclical structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command, which is then executed from a shell. the command should accept the graph file as a parameter, and output the calculated layout of the graph to stdout in the xdot format. with such a layout command, you can give & eg; algorithms, or even modify the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Determines the type of the graph (directed or executed) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type (dot; for directed, & neato; for unexecuted graphs).</seg>

<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and save new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan images: use the Kooka interface to read images from a scanner supported by the Sane project or another source such as Video Streams. to do this, you have to have Kooka and Sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you open the File menu item, a dialog appears, which lets you select between all available sources on your computer. select here the source from which you want to pick the image. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window appears by replacing the default values ducrhe own to select your image. view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you start scanning the image. the estimated file size will be displayed in the right lower corner. see the Kooka manual for more information.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure the window is completely displayed as some settings may not be displayed otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="778">After you have pressed the Scan button you have to wait until the scan is complete and the window to set the image file options appears. please remember that the BMP type does not compress and therefore creates very large files. you also need to select the folder & # 160; select or create by saving the image.</seg>

<seg id="797">The Export Module to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time, you will be guided through the process of generating a token. it is used for your authentication so it is virtually your ID to Flickr. a browser will be started so that you can login to Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After the successful registration the module can send photos to the Flickr website. the following page will be presented to you after a successful login.</seg>
<seg id="800">Just close the browser window and return to the program. after you have clicked Yes, you will get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">When the module exports to Flickr is launched twice, you will be welcomed with the following dialog, which displays the current access permissions that the module displays. to upload, you need write permissions. the module currently does not support other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button Add photos should once pressed after you have set all the other options. with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. if you click on the Ok button, upload the photos to the Flickr Server.</seg>
<seg id="803">The Tags field can be filled with a list of words separated by comma. these are added to the image as keywords during upload.</seg>
<seg id="804">The Public, Friends and Famillie options allow you to set the permissions to your pictures. by default, the photos are classified as private.</seg>
<seg id="805">If you choose the change the size of the photos before uploading, the photos are changed before uploading in size. size is taken from the value recorded at maximum size.</seg>
<seg id="806">The maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images. the size is modified to keep the aspect ratio constant.</seg>

<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographic localization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. geographic data are stored in the EXIF key words of the image and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization provides tools to locate images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, longitude and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as XML file in the gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization Correlator. this interface can bring together a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu. the above-looking dialog appears then. to load a possible correlation about time and localization, you need to load a track file with GPX file. this file of course contains data that were recorded at the same time in the same locations as the pictures of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed which shows the coordinates in red. GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted with the GMT. this can be done using the time zone. set your camera time zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for the maximum time deviation gives an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time. if the deviation is below, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you have no trace data from one location for images, you can edit the gpx file manually and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all the images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolate and difference in min. can be used if you have no adequate data. if you know that in reality is a location in a big time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button correlations for interpolating.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful when you have made a series of photos at the same place. since the dialog box is the coordinates of a call to the next you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set with the displayed map. to do so, select the region and enlarge sie.Lead this over and over again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the map can be changed manually between card mode, satellite image and mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are ways to attach the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module image gallery is a tool for exporting a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages conform to version 4.01. you can select the albums that you want to export as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to allow the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The tab has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted. you only need to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML. the albums are not displayed hierarchically. with the three buttons on the right, you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below you will see the alpha preview and the text that appears in the header of the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this tab is largely self-explanatory. the option for each picture to create a page creates a gallery in which each image also gets its own page. if you then click on a picture, a new page is opened in which the image is displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer, & eg.</seg>
<seg id="825">The tab Album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be stored with all your associated images. to do this, select a folder where you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLExport which contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original pictures will also be saved in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">You can change the default color depth with Other color depth. of course, this also affects the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The tab preview images allow you to customize some of the settings from the album tab for thumbnails, these are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. therefore, you can read the program messages to see if errors occurred during the creation. the web browser will automatically start at the end to preview the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool for viewing images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as turns, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse gestures. it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is displayed in full screen mode by default. this can be changed to a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless module is a tool to change images without compromising your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows to save images in JPEG format for the actions listed below, without the usual losses in quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of loss-free storage is that the file size is increasing because no compression of the color information takes place. this can also be found in the PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client has no documentation right now. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the mailinglist kde-imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. to do so, select the image that you want to copy to the main program and then call the Import function. this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image, the image to which you want to copy the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere but not write to any target format. JPEG is supported when writing. please check iv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodi Module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG encoders module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the packages MjpegTools and ImageMagick. between the single images you can add a base picture transition. you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV of the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. additionally, you can select a background color for the slide show. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">First you have to select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG slideshow. after that you can create the module using Extras MPEG Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected by you are then listed under image files in the Portfolio section. there you can also change the sorting of the images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from different formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to play the file on a TV, you need to select the corresponding TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds the one image is displayed. the speed of the image transition is specified below. a low value creates very sudden, a high contrast very smooth image change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in case of doubt, you should let them black. you can specify the name and path of the created file using the name of the MPEG output file. keep the extension mpg as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file with the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adapted all the settings to your liking, you can start the production of the movie with the button coding. depending on the speed of your computer you can now quickly or in all calmness enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slideshow if you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a critic appears that encoders or tools are missing, you can customize the paths to the programs of the jpegtools and ImageMagick packages using the button Settings right down.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print wizard allows you to print several images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image image gimp. this is e.g. useful to improve or print directly to the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import or convert your images stored in RAW to one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw from Dave Coffin. an original quote from Him is: expect dcraw not to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the raw file that you want to convert and start the module. the Raw Image Converter window will then appear in mode for a single image. with the Preview button you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now re-adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance. the essential parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue enhancers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the file name stays the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image Format, TIFF, keeps all the information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you plan to edit your images frequently or later otherwise you should not choose the JPEG format because it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion with the execute button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch editing mode allows you to convert different images at one time. therefore, use this mode if you are certain, e.g. by testing on a single image, which is the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, you have the possibility to overwrite the existing file automatically. this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to re-compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can resize or enlarge the image.</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in one dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on the image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option, for example, to adjust your image to the screen size.</seg>
<seg id="870">Non-proportional: disproportionate size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Preparation: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can set the print resolution and size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, border size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your preferred email program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent. additional images can drag and drop the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the image window will be displayed with the images selected by you. you can add more images via the button Add pictures with a file selection dialog. for the last selected image, a preview is displayed on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag and drop images to the list of images in order to add them to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">The Select Reset button removes the selected images from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After selecting all the images, you can open the new message window to your e-mail client using the OK button. you just have to add the addresses and the subject here. the images selected by you are already attached as attachments.</seg>
<seg id="877">Do not forget to send too many pictures at once. most e-mail accounts have limitations on the size of emails sent. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration will be saved and used every time you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you will need to specify the right path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail service, you must first install the Gmail agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in an attached file, the comments to the images will be added to a text file and the mail attached.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format from the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats such as TIFF. therefore, you should use PNG when you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG in pictures file format and the original JPEG files are in JPEG format, then the original copy data will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not be closed automatically so you can view the status messages in search of bugs. your e-mail program will be started automatically at the end.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Slideshow, a window with questions like you want to display your slide show appears. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The option OpenGL-transitions in the presentation will activate very elegant image transitions by OpenGL. however, you must have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The option Show names ensures that the filename of the images will be shown in the lower left corner of the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option causes the presentation to be displayed in an infinite loop. you can then manually cancel it with Esc; Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images randomly select that the images are displayed in a random order. so it is not used the order of the pictures in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The distance between the images can be set between the images. 1500 milliseconds equals 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect. so you should check it out before you show the presentation to your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are over a dozen transition effects between which you can choose. randomly, every transition between the images selects a different effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slide show, you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the bottom of the bottom of the screen you can see the current filename, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date has no documentation right now. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the user interface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as background for your KDE working surface.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have annotated your images and videos, you can use & kphotoalbum; Browse through these, see picture. as you can see by comparing with the image, there are now in every group, i.e. in persons, places and in group keyword records.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window, you will see the categories for which you have entered information as you have provided your images and videos with annotations. additionally, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current preview images. in the following, each is described for itself.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you press the mouse on the entry, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person, only the pictures are displayed on which both persons are visible. through this selection method you can limit the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few individual pictures.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all persons, locations and other settings, you can view thumbnails to view the images of your area of activity.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture, each person has the same symbol in front of her name. you can do with & kphotoalbum; however, for each person storing his own thumbnail, this also applies to places, keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images next to the names, select the button located to the right of the toolbar. in the appearing context menu, you can select which view you need to set for each category separately. this has the advantage that you can display icons with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you need to determine which image should be displayed for each individual person. to do this, you need to open the image view window (described in more detail) and select the image for the corresponding person in the context menu. here you can customize the image for the corresponding person. in the view window, you can customize the magnification factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image to be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">If you enter the search in the main window, a dialog will appear to you, which is very similar to the dialog for setting the picture properties. you can view this dialog in the image again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the Text Caption or Description field, the captions and descriptions of the pictures will be searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to search for; the date can be either a part of the total date, i.e. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two dates, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window you can search all images according to certain names as you can see in the picture. here, pictures on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & photoalbum;. if you don't like to read manuals, but rather want to try out functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the Homepage of & kphotoalbum; and take a look at the quick entry, the screenshots and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & photoalbum; and select the demo in the first dialog if you start & photoalbum; for the first time, or select the photoalbum menu item in the Help menu. after that, some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of the photoalbum;</seg>
<seg id="912">If you would rather like to print this manual, you can find it on the Homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a contiguous HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar is shown here:. as the name already says, this bar shows you date statistics on the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">Each bar displays another unit. you can switch between units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed entries Preview from the database (if you select a date, the first image of this date will be displayed in the preview) and the timeline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select an area of the time line by holding the mouse button down and dragging the mouse over the ruler of the time line, i.e. the time data. if you select an area, only pictures of this period will be displayed in the preview view. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar on the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides you with two ways to create html web pages with your images. one is in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other available as module (see). in the following part of the user manual, the in & kphotoalbum; integrated version is described, which you can create via the File HTML menu...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages you need to make some adjustments. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and goal. in the following, each area is described more closely.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the title and a description that the HTML file will contain later. on kphotoalbum; HTML example pages you will see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next select if a & kphotoalbum; export file should be created which is to be seen on the overview page. misty information about the export files can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Last, you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid displaying information that is obvious to the viewer without a description. for example, that all images are from a party. note that all pictures are from a party. therefore, you cannot use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can specify how the HTML pages are supposed to look. most settings are unambiguous, which is why it is not dealt with specifically.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page, you can set different resolutions for the images, so those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600 do not have to download images that for example have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you set. so it can browse your images with low resolution, which results in a lower transmission time. if you want to get a picture larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, specify the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">The best way to choose a base folder for all your HTML files and a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the main folder in which all your images will be saved. this folder will be saved and added automatically next time. this allows you to specify the location for all future pictures. here you can select either a folder or a protocol supported by KDE, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if these really are all visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser after the pages have been created will be started. the URL you set here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files you created are not yet in the final destination folder, you must manually copy them to them. in order for the import function, see, properly, you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The just described settings have all three related to base folders or URLs. in these, a subfolder is created, the name of which you specify in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & photoalbum; coming together, you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures. however, if you have already spent a lot of time viewing the picture information, people on the pictures, location, etc. then you have to do with & kphotoalbum; this work will not go once again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file. these can import other ones into your database. the image properties are imported with ex- and importing.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external ones. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored with in the file or if there is only a link to images in the file. the advantage of saving all images into the file is that you have all the images together and that you can pass this file independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kim file either directly from the File Export menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in two ways. first, it searches the images that are in the .kim file folder. if the corresponding pictures are not found, the images of the URL you specified when you create the HTML files will be searched. this is only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">The following section describes the dialog for exporting images that you can invoke via the Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available to you:</seg>
<seg id="938">With the Manually option to copy to the .kim file, you will need to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatically move to the .kim file copied & kphotoalbum; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worth compressing the files. if you still like this, simply select the Export File option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is Maximum image size. if you send images to your friends, you might not want to send the pictures in full size, since the .kim file would otherwise be very large. here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File Import menu... select & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard for importing consists of four steps. first, you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folder the import images are to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalize the category people of the file to import (if you are a domain), while this category is called persons in your database. therefore, in the third dialog box, you will be asked which categories of the file to import and which categories should correspond in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. an example of this can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It just has to be easy to browse and look at images: if you look at images, you often want to jump inside various picture groups. if you look at images of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend on it, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will go through the different steps of (1) Setting the information about your images, through (2) the browsing and viewing, to (3) advanced themes and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum has been started as a program for managing your pictures, but it has been expanded and today your videos will also take care of. in many places in this manual you will talk about pictures, but often this also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& photoalbum; stores all its information in the index.xml file in the top folder of your images. this is a simple XML file that you can backup to a program of your choice, such as Normal backup tools, to a floppy or revisions in CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& photoalbum; remember the folder where your images are stored and use this in future starts automatically. if you want to read another database in & photoalbum; you can start the photoalbum; with the -c option. as an example: photoalbum -c ~ / Company / Pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Through the menu entry Settings kphotoalbum; set up... you get to a window with which you can change the settings of the photoalbum; in the following section of the user manual you will explain the different settings options.</seg>
<seg id="952">To the left, you can see six different symbols, with which you can view the settings of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which you can call by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how to set different properties for each image, e.g. people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups like objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog used to edit already existing groups. for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">Subcategories have already been mentioned in the section. in the Options dialog, you can set up complete groups of members, i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained in the section.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the list below you can select the category you want to configure. in the left side of the window is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub-categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; splits its modular system with other graphics applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; image plugin interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">Modules can and will not be described in this manual since they are not part of & photoalbum; however, most modules have a help page that you can call via the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used together by several applications, it may be that the modules have been tested with & kphotoalbum; therefore you should always test new modules first with the demo database before applying them to your own pictures. demo database can be called either via the command line with the command &gt; kphotoalbum -Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu.</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules over KIPI are very different, whereby it can be that some modules with & photoalbum; do not work. this is the disadvantage when you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & photoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications use their images in albums: this is an album simply a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this type of order does not support, it simulates the order for albums for some modules so that you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum;</seg>
<seg id="962">This simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album that is simply the current view, so all the pictures that show you the preview currently.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, & kphotoalbum; the modules also have a list of albums. here goes & kphotoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s browser shows the contents of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry in this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you specified in the preferences dialog as a category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you use the category individuals, you will do & photoalbum; so do so if you have selected people to view and pass on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & photoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. to do so, start the settings dialog and select the modules to load modules in the module.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start the photoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used to by any other KDE application, you can see at the top a menu and toolbar. currently, it does not contain a lot of information, since you have not yet entered information about your images. in the section we will return to this window, but now click on the images to show you an overview of all available images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to mark any picture with annotations. this includes information about the persons shown on the picture, etc. you can set each image individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time. if, for example, on all images Jesper is mapped and all pictures taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments can be used for searching and browsing, as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these comments if you are using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">You can see three lists with a text box by specifying persons, locations and keywords. these are a very important part of & photoalbum; since you will always use them again and again, when you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on moving the images within the list: if you have for example a family celebration and on all 50 images the same 5-10 persons are mapped, you can find that the names used are moved upwards, the people find and arrange them faster.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetically sorted list, click on the sorting icon after date on the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected comments for each image individually, you may want to edit all the selected images and add comments to these images. in this case, simply click on the above and back buttons that are located under the preview of the image on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have taken several images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Several entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA. besides, San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">The picture shows a browser window displaying the USA as an overboard. to show you that it is a supergroup, a special icon will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the Comment dialog context menu it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new subcategory. in addition, you can also simply drag one entry to a category and place it in order to sort it into a subcategory of this entry. attention, this assumes that you sort your categories alphabetically. see for it.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bars that form the upper edge of the frame. you can also make a separate window from a frame by dragging it outside the window pane.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adjusted the appearance of the window to your needs, that you are satisfied with the settings, click the Options button... which offers among other things the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also display a frame completely. if you want to see this window again later, use the Options button... and then hide the window. you can see this process in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the images in the browser, you get an overview with preview images of the currently selected images, or all images in case you have not set filters. an example of this can be seen here. you can configure the size of the thumbnails by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop an image on the background of your desktop, this image is set as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, it will be displayed in the image viewer. if you have not opened a window with an image viewer, a new window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the preview. simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and press the Remove button or select Delete from the Edit menu. now the window that you can see in the picture will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; provides you with a solution for this problem. you can also use pictures without having you saved on your hard disk. of course you need to have the images stored somewhere so that & photoalbum; you can record the photo album; in the picture you can view the view of & photoalbum; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="987">Pictures in which the right upper corner is cut off are not stored on the hard disk. however, this is present in the pictures 1-9. however, for the pictures 5-9, the thumbnails are present so that & photoalbum; you can also view these images with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this feature requires you to copy and copy files from the folders. & photoalbum; does it still not support you to ask for inserting the CD concerned. so if you want to avoid annoyance on how to avoid the confusion of your images, please purchase a larger hard drive to store all the images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the Pictures menu you will find a sub-menu with the name Privacy. if you want a little more privacy, filter the pictures in such a way that at the end those who want to make them inaccessible and click the current view in the privacy menu. alternatively, you can control all the images that your little sister may see, control and block the menu entry All except current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">With this you have determined which pictures should be hidden in the case of the case. if you give your laptop now to your little sister, simply select the menu item to lock images, so all the pictures you have locked will be hidden. if you want to get the pictures again, click on Lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select password in the Privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please keep in mind that this image protection is by no means very safe. on the one hand, anyone who can access the file index.xml can read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection is only used to forbid those with & photoalbum; not very familiar to forbid the view to private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you want to spend all your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to consider them at some point. for this reason, the photo album has an image _ and video viewer. you can start this from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">You can see the viewer in. of course he shows the picture, but additional all the information you have to enter through the picture, such as who is on the picture, when and where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the infobox on the upper part of the image you want to see, you can simply drag it with the mouse and place it somewhere else. you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information should be displayed at all. all of these options are available after a right-click on the viewer. the appearing context menu can be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="996">If you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Helene. as if you selected persons from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have multiple images loaded in the viewer, you can switch between them before and after by using the image high and image. you can jump to the first and last image with Pos1 and end. these functions can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several images are loaded in the viewer, you can run it as slide show. & kphotoalbum; then load a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer of & kphotoalbum; is it possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete place on the screen. just use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer you can move in and zooming in the image. to zoom in, you can zoom out a rectangle with the mouse. with the minus button you can zoom out the plus button zooms in the middle of the picture. shows how a zoom-rectangle is selected and shows the result of the zoom.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the dot key you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. with the same key, zoom into the zoom, so that every pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work with videos are in and out zooming with the plus and minus key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">The screenshots from the context menu allow you to rotate the image. this does not work for videos. you can make comments to the current image using the menu item annotations from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you view images it can happen that you find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture. at the moment you can cancel the view and open configuration dialog of the image to enter these names. however, you may prefer to mark only the picture and see more images.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper. to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the images and mark them as good or bad while you view one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to tag images with attributes as you view them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter. in the picture you see a picture where the characters A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have placed attributes on your images, you can see them in your browser. so if you want to print, print or whatever you have selected, simply print them all at once with annotations. this is described in. after that you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to make.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view. if you display categories in the front view, you can add features to the pictures by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case, you are allowed & photoalbum; to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The restore is not saved with the image, but in the database. in the way you can undo your gems later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">To enable the painting mode of & kphotoalbum; to turn on, select View on the picture from the context menu. to end the painting press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; you need to use the program & Povray; not fully proficient, but the documentation to & Povray; should you absolutely read and understand.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wireframe views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time, but not the object of an object already selected, since all subobjects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and either click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the Add menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop-down menu will pop up so that you can choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">You can delete selected objects from the scene by deleting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to take these changes. if you entered invalid values, a message appears with a fault description. then you can correct the input errors and click Apply again or reject the changes with Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press Preview in the property view and a small example of the scene is rendered with the selected texture. as a default, the entire texture is rendered, even if you want to render a part of the texture (for example, a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), cross the box locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and thereby change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and a small cross will appear in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for moves. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse within the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a stage of visibility as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the parent object or as absolute value. objects are only displayed when selected, or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the visibility stage chosen in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement, you can set it as desired. you can also save several window orders and simply switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or below a view, drag the user to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle will then display the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the user to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other, drag the amateur in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the tabs on top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view from the anchorage, drag the user on the desktop or click the small arrow pointing to the left at the beginning bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view click on the small cross in the beginning bar. to prevent closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can add additional views into the main window. in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them at any place.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can be saved with View window order... saving it. a dialog appears where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render it. & kpovmodeler; uses & Povray; 3.1g to render, this program has to be properly installed. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click the Rendering icon The icon Rendering in the toolbar or select the menu item View scene render.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode corresponds to entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert as many render modes, from a quick preview to full pictures of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or in the View Mode menu... select the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it makes sense, but it makes sense to recognise the features of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the Size Guide Size, you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the picture, select the check box subsection and enter the image section to render into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the quality combination field, you can select the properties that & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuse reflection lighting. a detailed description of render features can be found in the User Manual & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with only one ray per pixel, various errors can occur. these images often have a moiré pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. generally, images look better with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn on anti-aliasing, calculate and connect & Povray; more than a ray per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as a standard, an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptively because the super-sampling the neighboring pixels are included. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively because each pixel is further divided and adaptively because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray tracks a ray per pixel. if the difference between pixels exceeds the given threshold, then both pixels are processed by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (R 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the predefined threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels that are followed individually and for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the ray process called Jittering. when you turn on Jittering, changes & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; it calculates diffuse light reflection. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can specify whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent when the associated beams have not hit the object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly terminated, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; scene, select the menu entry file Import... and select a file in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; not yet the full command sum of & Povray;. if error messages or warnings appear when importing, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not want to support source code in & kpovmodeler; import, write this source text between the two particular comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRwEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source for & Povray; this adds the source code of the object to the opened text file in the editor. simply select the source code in the editor and drag it to the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">Copy and paste to & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can add source code for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene rendered. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on the help in the property view, open and kpovmodeler; the & Povray; User documentation to the displayed object. set the path to your document retention and version here. supported are versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (e.g. altitude field data) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you also need to enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for the display of the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object capture of the dots to the grid in the context menu of the wire-model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotation.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects such as the ball, you can set the detail level separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you tick high attention to detail for enhanced projections, all wire-model views are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions from the perspective and the vertical projections. this feature gives a better approximation to projections, but requires more time to render.</seg>
<seg id="1068">If you tick the wall, a wall is rendered behind the objects. the wall is represented in a chessboard pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you tick the floor, a bottom is rendered below the objects. the bottom is represented in a chessboard pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick the edge smoothing, the non-recursive anti-aliasing method is used for rendering the scenes. you can set the values for depth and threshold value. more exact details about the parameters can be found in the Render modes section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page, you can change existing window orders or create new window orders. in the Window System section it will explain how to create and save window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The combination panel Standard window arrangement: shows all existing window configurations. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing window orders shows all existing window orders. a new arrangement allows you to create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected layout by removing the button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement. you can create new views using the Add button and delete selected views using the Remove button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with New column you create a new column on the right side of the existing windows, with Unten anchor the window under the existing window, with map board you get a map view together with the previous view and floats the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without more detailed knowledge of both programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only get a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules can be applied to rendering, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert light sources, your entire scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything correctly, see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following default window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of the toolbar. please read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols often, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you must first remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu item Edit Delete. so you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera views the whole scene you are creating. in particular note that in the fourth wire model view (right down). this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera. this shows you the result of the renderation of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will see the content of the view object properties in which you can find the different parameters of the camera. in the user documentation to & Povray; see for more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Change nothing to the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera has control points that you can change the target point of the camera. just click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you press the Apply button or enter the Enter key, the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the camera's point of view.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. you could, for example, insert a header (insert infinite body torso) and adjust the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome method of solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually provides a simpler way. you can use an infinite plane as floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the layer in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply button or enter the Enter key. in the object tree, the new name is displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wireframe view now also indicates the level, albeit at the moment only as a finite finite level. if you render the scene, the plane expands to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look closely at the object tree, you will find that you can fold the entry for the bottom if you click on symbol + in front of the object. in this case, you will only see the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should shift the bottom line to the horizontal line, just to get to know some of these parameters. select Shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but you can choose a simple one at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog opens, in which you can select how to insert the object. please select first object. you can change the name in the property view (name = bottom-pigment), with a click on the button preview you can see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigment only shows a matte black material, because you still have to enter settings for the pigment. always remember that you can check the look of materials at any time with a click on preview.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see any color on the header and ball in the preview, just click on the Apply button and then preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is set correctly now. if you are rendering your image now with a click on the symbol, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color you expected. here are additional settings necessary. in the color list you have to enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more often, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Each time you select the color in the object tree and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should be done simply because you should have already understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; you should already have understood the sphere as easy as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (do not forget to press the input key or the Apply button), so the ball has contact with the ground. otherwise, the ball would float above the ground, since you have moved the floor around one unit down.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course rendering now a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface appears like a matte black material. put a suitable material in the next step.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have chosen the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as with the floor, give the sphere a pigment as a color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select First object and change the name for example in Ball Pigment. click on sphere pigment, then select Into and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as shown in the following screenshots and click Apply or push the Enter key.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The brightness effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chrome-plated surfaces, even if metal: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what possibilities you & kpovmodeler; offers. hopefully you have learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracypricing is a render method to produce a two-dimensional picture of a three dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you raytracing a scene, the rendering can shoot hypothetical rays from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) through each pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this ray is reflected by the objects in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog have an effect.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you view the scene. without a light source you also don't see anything, the image is just black. obviously, every scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog you can select a file that you created previously with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this submenu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">Once you have already saved the model, it will be stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you will need to enter a name and disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last saved session will be discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">You can only select this menu entry if you don't have saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last reversed command. you can select this menu entry only if you have used Editing Undo.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or override an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, shortcuts and default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog for changing keyboard shortcuts. you can use this option to modify or add new shortcuts for & kpovmodeler; commands change or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set the toolbars. you can use this option to add and remove toolsymbols for & kpovmodeler; commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump-Map is an option for pretending rough surfaces without having to model each dent on the surface individually and without changing the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for a Bump map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic shapes are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these base bodies. these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by applying a picture file as a color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kudexshow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed in either a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kudexshow; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can view by clicking the & LMBs; or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can specify whether each image should be displayed in a separate window, or whether all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a particular file, simply type the first character of the filename in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the lower right corner. if a matching file name is found, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In the Configuration & Play Show dialog, there are five flashcards. in three of them, General and Editing and Slideshow, you can set the mode of operation of & kudexshow; in the other two, short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser, the shortcuts for the respective windows can be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If this is selected, the images will be opened in full screen mode. if the image is not large enough to fill the screen, the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color that you can set further down. default is not full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">When this point is activated, the next image in the folder will load, while you still look at the current image. this reduces the delay if you select the next image and is particularly suitable for a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="1137">With this option saves & kudexshow; when moving the name of the last opened folder. at the next start opens & kudexshow; this folder in the browser window.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Click on the colored bar to select a background color. this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode. if in window mode the window is larger than the image, the background will also be filled with the selected color.</seg>
<seg id="1139">You can set up & kudexshow; set up that only some of the file types can be displayed that can also display the program.</seg>

<seg id="1141">Determines whether the slide show should begin with the first image in the folder or with the selected image.</seg>
<seg id="1142">To change the value, you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right next to the input field. the default is 3 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1143">The number of repetitions. if this value is set to 0, the slide show is repeated until it is aborted by the user. to change the value, you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right next to the input field. default is 1.</seg>
<seg id="1144">Change the keyboard shortcuts for the different modes of operation of & kudexshow; in the flashcards brief instructions for the display window and short commands for the browser.</seg>
<seg id="1145">With this option, switch between the two-part view of the file system (a window for the subfolder and a window for the files) and the one-piece view of the file system with folders and files in one window.</seg>

<seg id="1160">& showscreenshot; try to give you so much control over its workflow as possible. there are many options that change the behavior of the showscreen.To access these settings, you need to set up the showscreenshot in the menu. the settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left side.</seg>
<seg id="1161">In the field of exposure indicators, you can select the color that is displayed when the under- or overexposure indicator was selected. skill-wise should contrast the colors with what you should display. underexposure should indicate a bright color and overexposure a dark color.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The main window of the showscreenshot has a sidebar at the right edge which provides important information and actions to the selected images. you can view the same sidebar in image editing. you can view it by clicking on one of the five tabs:</seg>

<seg id="1164">& skanlite; is a simple application for scanning images that no longer makes to scan and save images. & skanlite; can open a dialog for saving for each image or save the images in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format. the user can also display the images before saving.</seg>
<seg id="1165">You can check the status of your scanner's support on the SANE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page: HTTP: / / www.sane-project.org / cgi-bin / driver.pl.</seg>
<seg id="1166">A default scanner can be set on the command line of & skanlite; with the command skanlite -d [device name] in the terminal. if this scanner is not opened or if no standard scanner is specified, a dialog for selecting the scanner will be opened.</seg>
<seg id="1167">The user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner. Cancel will stop & skanlite; Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="1168">The other settings contain more detailed options of the driver. & skanlite; (libksane) does not handle these options particularly.</seg>
<seg id="1169">To scan a picture, the user can start a preview scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan. the preview can be started by the preview button.</seg>
<seg id="1170">To better select the image, the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection. it can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview will fit into the window.</seg>
<seg id="1171">When the image has been selected, the final image can be read with the Scan button.</seg>
<seg id="1172">If before saving a preview is selected in the settings, then the image is displayed in a preview window as shown below. when saving is pressed, then the image is saved and Schlie? s leads to a break and you will get back to the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1173">The Settings button opens the dialog with the same name in front of the main window. you can change the main settings here.</seg>
<seg id="1174">The user can view the image if desired, before saving. in this case the option must be selected before saving a preview. if this preview is not desired by the user, then the option must be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1175">This setting allows you to select the type as & skanlite; images saved. dialog to Save for each image opens the dialog in front of each scanned image. if & skanlite; this will automatically save it with a generated name in a previously defined folder, then you must select Save without asking for a filename.</seg>
<seg id="1176">This setting defines where the images will be saved with the Save option without asking for a file name. if the images are saved after each scan, then this folder will be used as the default for dialog for saving. the default value is your home directory and you can change this using the button...</seg>
<seg id="1177">This parameter defines a picture prefix for the images to be stored automatically and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving. the automatically saved image gets a numerical suffix that is uploaded every time a picture is saved. the string # # # is replaced by the numbers.</seg>
<seg id="1178">The user can adjust the image quality used to save. this value also changes the compression value when saving. if choosing the image quality is not selected, then the default value of Qt is used.</seg>

<seg id="1182">You can set up existing multi-media buttons in such a way that they function as & Amarok; short commands. this will make your keyboard & Amarok; control center.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface from Amarok has many general functions that are mostly found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe DCOP functions of collection, context browsers, players, playlists, playlists browsers and scripts. an example call for the DCOP function break could & zb; look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command line options of Qt and & kde, and Amarok also has some command line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency. please check in your script if all required modules are present and use kdialog to enable the user to know why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Start require 'Korundum' Rescue LoadError error = 'Korundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is required for this script.' 'kdialog --sorry' # {error} '' exit</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder, you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply extend them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command, which should be included in each KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most script languages make it possible to execute external programs and commands. usually the exec () function is used. in this way dcop &gt; can be invoked relatively easily. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends alerts to all running scripts. for this reason, strings are written to the default input of the script. for this reason, scripts should constantly monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events. of course, a script can ignore the events when there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Sets the script to display the setup dialog. to save and load the setup data, each script must take care of itself. if a script is started, Amarok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange Shows that a new piece is being played. the script could now & zb; with DCOP functions, you can query more information about the new piece (for example, the metadata or the length of the piece).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newVolume signals a change in volume. the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Customize MenuClicked: submenu itemTitle Categories Contains the path to the selected files of the playlist when a custom menu entry is clicked. to add an entry you can use the DCOP function dcop Amarok script addCustomMenuItem (Submenu itemTitle). to remove an entry you can use dcop Amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (Submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; terminates, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to do, for example, storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script administration can also install script packages which the user & zb has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar) which can optionally also be compressed with bzip2 (.tar).</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept scripting packages with the empowerment of amarokscript. for this reason, you should name your script packages right away.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the other modules to be loaded should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file permissions:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can upload it to www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki scripts page of & Amarok; for your entry to kde-apps you should use the Amarok; scripts category.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & Amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus. you might also find a very specific title for thousands in your collection. with & Amarok; s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Maybe you already have some playlists, but can never decide which you want to hear? then the playlist browser is just the right thing for you. and if you still find it hard to choose, the dynamic mode and the smart playlists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Amarok has an excellent support for Apple's iPod, iRivers ifp and many generic USB devices. furthermore, many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music. Amarok is intelligent, sexy and chic - just the right way to rediscover your music!</seg>
<seg id="1204">Usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amarok sources to compile and install Amarok:</seg>
<seg id="1205">Because & Amarok; auto conf and automake are used, you should not have any trouble compiling. if you encounter problems, please report them to the & kde; mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="1206">& Amarok; like most applications, has some options that can be activated or deactivated at compile time using the configure script. this is a list of available options.</seg>
<seg id="1207">For some of the compile options certain dependencies must be met to be used. details can be found in the System Requirements section.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Enables debugging symbols. you have the choice between yes, no and full. if you want to help with the development of & Amarok; you should use full.</seg>
<seg id="1209">& Amarok; can be set up without effort across the setup dialog. the setup dialog has several flashcards to set up the different functions of & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1210">In addition to the player window, the player window will turn on or off in addition to the playlist. if the option is disabled, only the playlist window will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Voice barometer: this function is only available if & Amarok; with support for moodbar compiled. the option switches the experimental function of the mood barometer.</seg>
<seg id="1212">More atmospheric: this function is only available if & Amarok; with support for moodbar compiled. this modifies the used color scheme for the mood barometer.</seg>
<seg id="1213">Save voice files from the music files: this feature is only available if & Amarok; with support for moodbar compiled. if this setting is enabled, .Mood files will be stored in the location of the appropriate music files. otherwise, the .mood files will be stored in the settings folder of & Amarok; (usually ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / moodbar /).</seg>
<seg id="1214">External Browser: lets you choose which browser from & Amarok; should be started when a browser is needed.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Other browsers use: here you can specify the path to another browser that is not in the list above.</seg>
<seg id="1216">Save the playlist when moving, save the current playlist automatically when moving & Amarok;. enable this option if you don't want to lose the current playlist when moving.</seg>
<seg id="1217">Relative paths for manually saved playlists: when you activate this setting, & Amarok; relative paths to the music files, starting from the location of the playlist, will use. otherwise, the absolute position of music files will be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Keeping the current piece visible when changing the piece causes the playlist to pop up / down to keep the current piece in the visible part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1219">Changing the context browser automatically displays the context browser when the next piece is played.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance section you can adjust the appearance of Amarok; the section is divided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the font section, you can set the use of different fonts in & Amarok; set. by selecting own fonts, the otherwise gray displayed section is enabled. you can select fonts for the following range: playlist Panes, Player Window and Context Browser. click Select... so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1222">With the Custom color scheme selection, you have the choice of choice and you can set your own color scheme. to do so, use the color selection for foreground and background color.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Resume playback when starting, that & Amarok; after program start, resume play automatically with the piece at the point with which it was stopped at the last stop.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Setting up the On-Screen display allows you to switch on the OSD. if on-screen display is used, a preview of the OSD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly.</seg>
<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click Select... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OSD. the check box shadow causes the text to be shaded in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Using your own colors gives you the option to customize the OSD colors for font and background. clicking on the color faces opens the dialog for selecting colors. if your own colors are not enabled, the default colors are used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The Display text entry field displays the text shown in the OSD. by entering wildcards, the OSD can be adapted to your own needs. below is a list of the available space holders and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The Display option is intended for Xinerama users, so you can specify on which screen a multi-monitor environment should appear on the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The audio card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop-down box. some drivers enable further adjustments in this card.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The Collection box collection is used to set up all settings for your collection. this includes the folder and type of database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folder that should browse & Amarok; search for music files. to include a folder in the collection, mark the check box next to its name. this section also contains check boxes for setting how to proceed with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Recursively search subfolders: this causes & Amarok; both the ticked as well as their subfolders will be searched for music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitoring changes: allows & Amarok; to monitor the selected folders to changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). in addition, an incremental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import playlists: effects that & Amarok; all found playlists in your collections folders (.pl- and .m3u files) added to your collection. the automatically added playlists appear later in the playlist browser.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The part collection database is used to select a database for the collection. the combination field driver: lets you choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, further configuration is required in the MySql subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="1236">The MySql section is used to set up the database for & Amarok; under Calculator: enter the host on which the MySql database is located. after that, the network port is entered under which the database is accessible. name: is the database name to which the connection is established.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Use username: and password: to enter the data needed for connection to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1238">The cardboards last.fm addresses the support for last.fm. & Amarok; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last.fm server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1239">Here you enter your username and password for your Last.fm profile. if you don't have a profile, you can register one on the last.fm website.</seg>
<seg id="1240">Send played pieces and then update the profile: this setting allows & Amarok; to transmit the names of played pieces to your last.fm profile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">Call for similar performers: after activating this setting, Amarok; a list of similar performers will be retrieved to the played piece. note: you don't need a last.fm profile to use this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (such as & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok requires only the package kdelibs and otherwise no other KDE packages. you need to have kdelibs installed (including the included programs, because & Amarok; requires some of them to find, for example, modules or scripts). we have written a small tutorial on how to compile kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as OSD presuppose that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of freedescaltop.org. so Gnome will work, but fluxbox will cause difficulties, for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt, because these provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably one of your files causes a bug in the tag library for days. you can locate the file by looking in ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this bug to the TagLib developer at bugs.kde.org and append the broken file that caused the crash.</seg>
<seg id="1246">It is mostly because Taglib crashes when reading the meta information from this file. please report this bug to the TagLib developer at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for this in & Amarok; is somewhat more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure that all libraries used by & Amarok; used libraries with the same compiler version were compiled. if, for example, & Amarok; with GCC 3.4, TagLib but GCC 3.3.X, this leads to crashes when editing the meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then disable automatically if inactive for... in setting the sound system, or use at least no value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace via e-mail (the e-mail opens automatically during a crash). if this is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error will be corrected.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 into the meta information, but do not mark them as Unicode. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl the "file $ARGV [0] does not exist" unless -f $ARGV [0]; my $v2tag = $mp3- &gt; get _ v2tag; print "Error in writing the tags of $ARGV [0]\ 'unless $mp3- &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2day, amp; UTF8);</seg>
<seg id="1253">This script needs the Perl module MP3:: Mplib. it can be reinstalled using this command: Perl -MCPAN -e 'install MP3:: Mplib'</seg>
<seg id="1254">& Amarok; s symbols in the status bar (random mode / repeat / dynamic playlists) are always actively visible in KDE 3.4.0. sometimes the symbol effects are simply forgotten. note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting shows its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1255">If you get this error, amarco app: symbol lookup error: amarca app: undefined symbol: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setDK7QPixmap, then check if Amarok uses the correct qt library. this can be seen with ldd 'which amarca app' _ BAR _ grep qt.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this bug, you may need to remove any conflicting Qt version or modify / etc / ld.so.conf so that Amarok finds the correct version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">Most installation problems are easiest through the help of an expert in your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also search for help with other users or developers. use the forum and IRC under irc.freenode.net in the channel # Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Bugzilla is not suitable for help. please enter only one error if you find something in the correction of a bug in Amarok itself.</seg>
<seg id="1259">After the start of & Amarok; only a blank playlist appears. how do you get music pieces there?</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is simple. use the file browser on the left and open the folder you want. then drag the files to the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To make the GUI more intuitive, the Start window has been converted to the statistics window. you can find it under Extras statistics.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars stand for rating by the user while the points are calculated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To evaluate chunks, the review column must be displayed in the playlist. click the title bar of the playlist and select column Show rating. click anywhere in the new application column to specify the rating for a piece. you can also use the short commands Windows + [1-5]. this also works if Amarok is in the background.</seg>
<seg id="1264">Select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard. or right-click on your selection and then select From Playlist Remove from the drop-down menu.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Drag a playlist file with your mouse into the playlist and drop it there, just like you would do with other files. that's how easy it is: -)</seg>
<seg id="1266">In the toolbar of the playlist, right next to the Add button, you will find the Playlist button. click on it.</seg>
<seg id="1267">You probably don't have the program xmms-config. install the xmms-config package and install & Amarok; new. also look for libtool, this package contains many very nice visualizations.</seg>

<seg id="1269">None! yes, that's true! no! & Amarok; uses a backend independent approach, therefore the real question is what types of media support GStreamer / xine / Arts / NMM / MAS / KDEM?. as you can see, we support pretty much any imaginable audio format. GStreamer can even decode text and PNG!</seg>
<seg id="1270">It may! perhaps you use Fedora / Red Hat Linux, where in default no MP3 decoders are provided (for patentage reasons). the solution: Alt-F2, gg: RedHat mp3 node, input key</seg>
<seg id="1271">Start the YaST Online update and install the 'Multimedia Option Pack 1'. so... & Amarok; plays MP3's: -)</seg>
<seg id="1272">If you are using the GStreamer driver with the alsa-sink, the device must provide a mixer. a mixer enables several applications to use the device at the same time and to output audio simultaneously. this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer (e.g. SBLive) or by the dmix module for alsa (software mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and a solution. for GStreamer, you may need to provide another sink (e.g. osssink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">This does & Amarok; already. don't forget that media first need to be decoded. you can't just send an MP3 to ALSA, you'd just want to listen to a white noise. GStreamer is reading the file, decodes it and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">XMMS also decodes the data first. GStreamer can output directly to ALSA, just like xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. open control center Sound & Multimedia Sound System. enable sound servers with the highest possible priority (real-time priority) and increase the size of the sound buffer (warning, see next point of the FAQ!). make sure that the SUID device wrapper is set:</seg>
<seg id="1277">KDE 3.2.x has problems with KDE multimedia codecs that can cause disturbed playback. read this bug report. enlarge the sound buffer in your ALSA setup file .asoundrc can also help.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Either do not use the Arts driver, but instead GStreamer or xine, or install KDE multimedia complete to get the faster Arts codecs (libarts _ mpeglib.so & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="1279">Probably use the Arts driver. use another driver (the xine driver has been strongly optimized for analyzer), or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound & multimedia, sound system. the smaller the buffer, the less supports react the visualizations. yes, this is a mistake, please help us fix it.</seg>
<seg id="1280">GStreamer is installed, but if I want to switch to the GStreamer driver, crashes & Amarok; ab. why?</seg>
<seg id="1281">After installing GStreamer, you will need to register all components. follow the registry to register all the GStreamer components.</seg>
<seg id="1282">Read the GStreamer FAQ. if that doesn't help, you can also ask in the IRC channel # GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="1283">Try this (quit Amarok earlier!): - Download and install ffmpeg, once as system administrator and once as your regular user. then delete all the ffmpeg files in the GStreamer module folder (you will find the module folder with the config / GStreamer-config) and run it again. start now & Amarok;.</seg>

<seg id="1333">& Amarok; is a versatile multimedia player. it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. like any normal multimedia player has also & Amarok; however, a playlist that is superior to all others. the playlist window contains multiple browsers with which you can capture and browse your entire music collection.</seg>
<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how to use all the functions of & Amarok; including creating a collection and a playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The Player Window is your one-click & Amarok; Control Centre. at the top of the window is a running text display that shows the current piece or the current stream. directly below it is the area, the play time, bit rate and samplerate of the current play. a click on this area changes the ad of the already expired play time to the remaining play time of the play.</seg>
<seg id="1336">The Player Window also includes a selection of audio analyzers, also under the message text display. you can change through the available analyzer by clicking the left mouse button on the area.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; Analyzer can be disconnected from the player window. press d on your keyboard and the current analyzer will be displayed in an independent, expanding window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">The PL and EQ buttons are also included in the running text display. the PL button activates or deactivates the Playlist window, while the EQ button is used to set equalizers.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons, the volume control and the piece-position slider. use the sliders to adjust the piece position or volume. with playback buttons, you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">The use of the built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 presets, from classic to techno, and you can easily create your own preferences.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To view the equalizer, use Extras Equalizer from the main menu or click the EQ button in the player window. once you mark the check box Equalizer, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The & Amarok playlist; is the most advanced playlist of all available multimedia players. it has many features that do not exist in any other player. but don't let the abundance of functions deter you, they are all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlist window can be divided into two main areas, on the left is the navigation pane. in the navigation pane, you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist, such as the context browser. on the right-hand side is the playlist itself. the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users powerful enough.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context-browser displays various information regarding the current piece. its appearance can be adapted with the help of context-browser designs. the context-browser contains three subwindows: music, text and performer. these three subwindows will be explained later in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & Amarok; you might notice that the subwindow starts to fall away. the information presented there is now divided into other parts of & Amarok; it is also possible to view the information collected in the statistical window (Extras statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The music sub-window displays information about the currently running piece, as well as the performer and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this subwindow displays information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, artist and the album. below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz Symbol. click on this icon to check the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">You will find further information on the current piece under the MusicBrainz icon. you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its rating.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To display cover images in the context browsers, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the image file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png are supported. the contextual browser will also display covers images that were either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the selected pieces are the favourite pieces of this performer. this section shows the five most valued pieces of the current artist.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can specify which information should be displayed in the music subwindow. to do so, right click anywhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, albums of the performer, lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will be opened and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all pieces in the single fields to immediately start playing. you can also right-click on it and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">This function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages using self-written scripts. once you click on the text subwindow, try & Amarok; to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if no text-script is running, you can choose which to start.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics. the modified version is then stored in & Amarok; s collection database. no running text script is required.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Find button opens a search on google.com after the song text for the current piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Artist - grouped only the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the performer. albums or genres are disregarded.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Artist / Album - First the pieces are arranged according to the artist, and a further division is made according to the respective album. if you want to see compositions or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Various artists.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Group Artist / Year - Album - Sort by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order (newest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - album name is related.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabetically by each other. the artist will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping genre / artist - your tunes will first be sorted by genre and, below, artist.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping genre / artist / album - This setting works just like the above, but is additionally sorted by album below the performer.</seg>
<seg id="1364">The remaining buttons allow you to customize and combine the grouping as desired.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically capture your collection once you change something on the selected folders. if you own a lot of pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">A search filter is located directly below the toolbar. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. information about using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Below the search filter is a selection box, with which help you can filter out the most recently added pieces to your collection. you can also choose from different time windows, starting from the last 24 hours to one year.</seg>
<seg id="1368">Clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser gives you the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This empties the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Attaching to Playlists - Add the selected songs to the current playlist. by double-clicking on an entry, you will get the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set pieces in queue - This function will insert the selected pieces into the queue. this will be played next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as a playlist... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist. you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Transfer the pieces to the media player for transfer to media players. see the Media Player Browser section for more details.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this performer / burn to CD - This will cause the selected pieces to be sent to K3b and burned either as a data or as an audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option will not be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... - Open dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(n) Move files into the trash bin... - Open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Mark the selection - select the selected album as a compilation, and it will appear under different interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Picking up a compilation - Changes the album marked as a compilation back into a normal album. afterwards, the album is no longer displayed under various interpreters but again under the associated interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlist browser makes dealing with many playlists very easy. among other things, it also includes Intelligent Playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart playlists. these use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists at runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist containing the pieces in your collection that have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created smart playlists are possible. click on Smart Playlist to open the dialog for creating a new smart playlist, where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The Media Player subwindow is used for connecting & Amarok; with your portable media player (e.g. iPod). to be able to use your iPod with & Amarok; in / mnt / ipod, for example. if & Amarok; started, you will find the pieces on your iPod to Interpret sorted in the upper list view of the Media Player Browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list Interpret. if you're done, click Apply. thus, the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod. if the transmission is finished, quit & Amarok; and loosen the drive connection for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Under the toolbar you find a search area with which you can search for a file. the search is especially useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser is an address bar with which you can fetch music from a given URL. for example, enter / home / mike / musik.tar.gz and press enter key, you can listen to music in the music .tar.gz. now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, dropping files may be difficult by simply dropping the shift key. in this case the holding down of the Shift key can be helpful: this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list, and not at the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">You can change the order by simply dragging the entries to the desired place by simply dragging the entries with the mouse. as soon as you enter letters there, only the pieces that contain the characters are displayed. to reset the filter, press the back button until the text field is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter delimited search terms by spaces, search & Amarok; search for entries containing all search terms. if you enter, for example, one two, the search will find all entries containing one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If you type OR between the search terms OR, search for entries containing either one or the other search term. example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces that contain one or two or three are found (or a combination of them).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries containing spaces, then close the keyword with goose feet: Mike Oldfield. this will search for entries that Mike Oldfield contain, but not for entries such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a specific search column, you can also search for larger or smaller. for example: rating: &gt; 50. This is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term, set a minus sign in front of the search term: -something looks for pieces that do not contain something.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax versions at will. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 comment: bad. this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield, or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment baths.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the sequence of entries by pressing the Ctrl key, and then with the right mouse button in the desired order on the entries. the entries then receive a marking with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the playlist. it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist. on the left, you will find the button Add, which you can add to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons will follow undo and restore, so you can undo or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1398">A unique, increased analyzer is located in the middle of the toolbar. the refresh rate can be set to the Analyzer by clicking the right mouse button.</seg>

<seg id="1400">There are many more buttons available for the toolbar, for example, playback controls and volume controls. you can set up the buttons by clicking on the menu and setting up toolbar buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist. it shows the title of the current piece, the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces. furthermore, the status for random mode and retrieval, a slider for the playing position and the playing time of the current piece is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also hide the status bar. to do so, disable the status bar in the General Settings.</seg>

<seg id="1458">Save all opened projects. this is the same as if you would call Save file for each project file.</seg>
<seg id="1459">Closes the current project. if a project has been modified and not yet saved, asks & k3b. you can then choose between saving and making changes. you can also stop closing and keep the project open.</seg>
<seg id="1460">Includes all opened projects. & k3b; will ask for any unsaved project what to do with it, just as if you had called for each project file closing.</seg>
<seg id="1461">Closes all opened projects and ends & k3b; for each project that is not stored, you will be asked what to do with it as if you would have called a file closing.</seg>
<seg id="1462">When you access this entry, you can select files to add to the project through the appearing dialog. this has the same effect as if you move the files directly from the top view into the project view. if the current project is a data CD, the files added will appear in the base folder of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1463">Open the "Burn" dialog for the current project. this dialog is basically the same as the project's properties dialog. the only difference is the additional button burning, the & k3b; prompts for the burning of the medium. the burning dialog can only be opened if the project already contains data.</seg>
<seg id="1464">Opens the Properties dialog for the current project. here you can make many project-related settings. each project type has different possible settings, most of them are described by the What is the? help described (accessible via the right mouse button).</seg>
<seg id="1465">This entry only appears for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. it causes & k3b to import files from a previous session into the current project. this is useful when you compile files for a multi-session CD. the data of the previous session will always be included even if this feature is not used. it is more likely to be considered for help so that you can see the files and folders already present on the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1466">This entry only appears in an active data CD / DVD or Video-DVD-Project. this function causes & k3b; to remove imported files from the current project. all other files will remain in the project. this function does not remove any files from the medium, it only displays the previously imported files.</seg>
<seg id="1467">Open the CD Copy dialog. this allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file. alternatively, you can also create a copy of a CD that you can burn later on. you should also prefer cloning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1468">The DVD Copy dialog opens, allowing you to copy DVD to another medium without a project file. alternatively, you can also only create a copy of a DVD, which you will burn later on. also, the copy / reduction of a DVD with the help of the copy dialog has not yet been supported, so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire (video) data of the source medium in its original form.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Open the dialog to delete a CD-RW, so you can delete the entire contents or parts of a CD-RW.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Open the dialog for formatting a DVD. with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R (W), whereby the content is completely erased. & k3b; allows you to choose between the write modes overwrite and incremental.</seg>
<seg id="1471">The dialog asks you for a * .iso, * .cue or * .toc file as a data source, which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button. (Neros * .nrg files are currently not supported, but you need to use other tools such as Nrg2Iso.)</seg>
<seg id="1472">The dialog asks you for a * .iso file as a data source, which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button.</seg>
<seg id="1473">This dialog window appears after reading a DVD in the content view, but can also be used alone. it contains information about the read video, encoding settings, and even options for changing the size and cutting black borders.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Displays information about the submitted medium. this information is displayed in the content view and includes properties of the medium, such as size and title length of the CD or DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Shows a list of toolbars of & k3b; if an entry is enabled, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">If this is checked, a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & k3b; and its activities. if this is not checked, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The folder view will display an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives. if the content view is enabled, their contents will be displayed in the content view. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as Media info, locks and unlock the drive or ejecting the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The content view allows selecting and dragging files into the project view. the content view is also the interface to read out audio or video CDs, if a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD has been selected in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The header is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the header has no real function, it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog box to change the key assignments for & k3b; after you have selected one of the available commands in the top part, you can adjust the key mapping to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This will start the k3b; setup wizard. this allows you to set the correct permissions to burn CDs and DVDs. to do this, you need to set the system administrator rights, so when you start the wizard, you must enter the password for the system administrator (root).</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & k3b; here general program settings can be made. almost all functions of & k3b; should work at first. this dialog is for personalising and fine tuning of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; applications also equipped with a & DCOP; interface. using this interface, parts of the functionality may be controlled, for example, via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP functions, you can either use the dcop command line or the somewhat more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical in functional scope, so your taste and nature of your task is critical, which of the accompanying programs will give you the advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you use the dcop command line program. to use the & DCOP functions, you need to make sure that & k3b is started. then enter something like the following at the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP functions, which all & kde; program have in common, supports & k3b; mainly two more parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & k3b; provides functions such as copyCD, formatted DVD and other functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createAstroCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () void burnCdImage (KURL url) void burnDvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can create a project via command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project using # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the K3bProjectInterface listed above and the powerful K3bvProjectInterface, which can only be applied to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString name, Qstring parent) void addUrl (QString path) void renameItem (QString path) void renameItem (QString path, QString NewName) void setVolume ID (QString id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill out a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders, and then inserts files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT addUrl / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; -read for & kde;. with it can easily be read audio CD; s can be read and stored in MP3 or OGG files. other formats are possible depending on encoder installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on hard drive) and by many encoders that encodes these wav files (lossless compression) by default (These encoders must still be installed from the Linux distribution). other encoders may be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD; read out and saved to WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these wav files (usually one per caption) are compressed into mp3 or OGG format or other formats such as lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, read out the & CD; it is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3) should be installed oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoders, so it is very likely not necessary to compile something yourself. however, only the encoders need to be installed that are needed. if for example FLAC is not used, its installation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which coding / file format should be used? the chapter Welcher Kodierer gives a small introduction about encoders, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia for reading out the audio data from the CD; if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device prevents protection, it is not possible to bypass any protected audio CD; even do not avoid the mechanisms of copy protection. simply avoid buying copy-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setup only needs to be performed once (the setup dialog can be called up until a suitable configuration is found), the daily use for reading a & CD is explained. this leads (hopefully) to the understanding of the lean approach of the user interface, which you will often stumble through at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which encoders are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the freedb from the Internet or can work completely without network, with everything being recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of commands from the main window. on the step by step example, further information on how this program is used, as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tabs for configuration of the program are located.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Start CDDB request of the CD data according to the setup of request in the CDDB tab. (this may be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the Internet has to be established first.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Starts reading and - when an encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup index - the encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a submenu with a list of available encoders, so that the selection can be read with a different encoder than the default. it must be noted that before the encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Open the file manager so that an already read file is selected for encoding rather than a full & CD; read out and encode.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notifications (such as protocols, pics) for program events (such as reading the & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog of & kaudio creator; with different card slots (such as Encoder, for setting the encoder). you need to go here before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoders and compression ratios and helps you choose the correct encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. apart from FLAC there are also other such as' shorten 'or' monkey 'which may be available for this distribution. the drawbacks are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG today may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bit rate the differences become less important since both encoders generate very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame will still be supplied with most distributions free of charge, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (at high bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly deeper quality with lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music should be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playsites exists.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special auto hi-fi systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly support only MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of audio quality parameters and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium' = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard' = This setting should usually provide acceptable visibility for most people and most music pieces, and has already quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems of high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems of high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems of high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR, common stereo, compression rate approx. 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a song. good enough for music of young people, portable devices and car osterolaters. but not good enough for better hi-fi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overdone for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without considering the file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is entered manually or automatically fetched from the freedb via the Internet is available in the program as a list of parameters. you can commit / use it with & kaudio creator; and the encoder program to create folder and file names as well as the properties of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoders and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the coding bars explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">E.g. to add the & CD; tracks to the keywords (English: day) when MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameter of & kaudio creator must be added. the result looks like '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button designation in the Wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download information, so that all others can download the information instead of entering the computer. it's important to note that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note of the translator: this is meant by the author) bin not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from being attached to the CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed. any information can be obtained anyway with a bumper through a CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is active to select a check box (sending an address). for the use of freedb can be used with another (fake) address as the one set in the system. in this type of configuration, it appears, the email address is not used when retrieving data from the server (this can only know the programmer who checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; used to use freedb, the geographically closest mirror server should be used. this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD;. alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">What readout program is used to save pieces from the & CD; to save in wav files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia is used; those who want to know more accurately, search in source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; s. note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this hasn't happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the selected wav files, the encoder and the desired file format can be selected. the first opening contains predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (loss-free compression for audio data) on the encoding tab. other encoders can be added to this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoder package must be installed from the corresponding Linux distribution before using the encoders. this is also required for the pre-defined encoders. more information about encoders can be found in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a encoder, more information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, read and write permissions on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, ognc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want a copy-proof audio CD; check out the cover of the & CD; this will not work!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bit rate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 words (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">Both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found, for example, with a search engine as it is regarded as not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can of course always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you own write permission (eg; by trying to copy something into it).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section deals with the basic set-up of & kaudiocreator; something that is likely to be done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to read out a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each outgoing & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoders to use for compression of the music (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting audio quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). since we are lazy, we share the program with which freedb to use the & CD; download data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change them at any reading of a & CD; change if the appropriate settings are found once.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the reading program so it can read the & CD; data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, a look at the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the entries of the device designations for CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The card-card General settings. here there is not much to do. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example everything is left / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Select only in case of incomplete information, so that you will be informed if information about the creation of keywords (tags) is missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card board CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically download via the Internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the Internet in order to access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection box is easier, will be a & CD; entry found, immediately starts reading the & CD;. this is associated with low risk if you are later unsatisfied with the database entry and the directory name / filename resulting from it, and the directory / filename resulting from it will be changed to Kid3, the & node; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, note that if you want to enter everything manually, disable the selection fields and freedb will not be used. however, you can use freedb locally in offline mode if you want to use the database before. however, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following card board.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for calling the & CD; information from freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the freedb section. set everything as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we did not download the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to the freedb.org site and look for a mirror server near you. on this way, the load is distributed between the hosts. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equivalent to the server, as many firewalls will boot the protocol 8880 by default, there may be more luck with the 80 protocol, as the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we do not want to transmit data to the freedb server. deactivate the first check box should suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the / tmp directory exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously discharging pieces: sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive? read and code parallel? the author does not know, therefore simply try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Discard CD; discard after reading the last piece: tick this to check the CD; discard at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this then / must be specified the path / folder where the wav files are saved. this can be useful if there is only room on another drive. if the field is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Enter everything as it is on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something has to be browsed to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as mentioned earlier, this is sufficient for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi stereo systems. the resulting bit rate is on average around 224-256 kpbs. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' to restrict the generation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' Tags can also be deleted if wished. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tag for & node; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as shown in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoded wav files: with a Dualcore or Quad core or even a multiprocessor machine, you can try to code more than one wav file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we have just finished the basic setup of & kaudio creator; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a & CD; used. if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wisely, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This section describes how the process of reading the & CD; runs on the hard disk. we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, has been set up in the previous section. first, a connection to the Internet is established, since we are comfortable and the & CD; the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each outgoing & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a CD, which is not yet contained in freedb, the screenshots look a bit different from the data obtained by freedb. therefore, you will learn the & CD; manually insert data instead of removing it from the Internet. comments are pointing to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Do not try the & CD; this example can be found. it is a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this has not been done yet, the & CD must be inserted into the drive that has been defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as shown in the screenshot. this only if the & CD; can be identified as Audio CD; can be read and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, then look for help in the section Questions and Answers, or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Note: if the & CD was successfully fetched by the freedb, all the titles of the pieces are already filled in and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In case there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; key for your & CD; a window will pop up, and you can select the database entry that best matches your & CD; it fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of freedb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for the settings), you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you do not have a local database, but fetch the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your CD; according to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'News Title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer needs to be entered in the field of "Actual Title" unless you have a collection of different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The bottom Comment field can be used for the individual comments of each piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments that are common to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Note: after the successful retrieval of the data from freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name (e.g. if all words with uppercase letter start or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment area. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudiocreator; maximum allowed.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later with the Tag Editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders or file formats. check the help of the encoder to get more information.</seg>

<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you will get back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD Editor appears again and you can see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data that we recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece. the title of the piece in any case and other information you desire.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed to the same way until you have entered all titles of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Note: this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are displayed above the BOM list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check mark in front of each line of a piece. a simple click on the line switches off the selection of the piece. make sure all pieces are selected, or press the All Pieces button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">When clicking the button selection starts reading the selection process, this window will appear to confirm. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the jobs and track what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab jobs to switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, right under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to check the jobs. the first piece is currently read out to the hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the lower left part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">You will see this error when you try to work with a code that you haven't yet installed. pieces that have not been successfully coded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we entered here in the example. did you check if you have write access to the temporary files and the destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">Order 1 reads the first piece, it's finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 to the format MP3. this allows reading and coding parallel. notice the status message in the bottom part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found a configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding. in the case of low-performance machines, the result is unclear. the computer used with an AMD64 does not seem to have a problem at simultaneous reading and coding (of two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read out while another piece is encoded and a third order is in the queue of the encoder. after the last piece is encoded, a small window opens with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>

<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizers, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select Open... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog with which help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; window into the & kmid; window. this also works with several songs simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the Play button in the toolbar, select the Play from the menu item, or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts as soon as you drag it to the & kmid; window. (for several pieces you will be added to a collection and then played one after the other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">As soon as & kmid; a piece plays, you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and navigating with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slowly, you can click on the arrows left and right of the speed display to change the playback speed. to restore the original tempo, double-click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a play is played, a pressure on the space bar acts as a pressure on the button Pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu item, thus interrupts playback. pressing the space bar while no piece is playing starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music. some pieces use text event, others use lyrics events and others. some pieces don't have any text at all: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can specify which events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically determined, which a song is used, so that you don't have to manually set the text selection, but you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set an event type, select the entries of text or song events from the Settings menu. the same function also has the 1 and 2 keys.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you can compose. these are played in series. this section tells you how to use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you can find this in the menu item under the point Organize.... click on New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking copy and then specifying the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs as the original one at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the desired items in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When you leave the application, this collection will not be saved. remember that when you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song with the Add button. it will again be the file dialog with which help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic Add to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic addition to the collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening (using file opening or drag & drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If automated add to the collection is not enabled, the temporary collection will be activated and emptied when opening a piece. this collection will then be added to the pieces that are still open.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you must open the collection manager, select the collection and the song you want and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the series from the submenu of the menu collection, the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order is re-specified.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it from the collection manager or use the selection list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">"" "to skip a song, select the" "" "Next song" "" "button, the next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right." ""</seg>
<seg id="1649">In order to jump back a song, select the button Previous piece, the item Forecasting Items from the menu item or press the button arrow left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection you want to delete and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not play a role since it is not stored when leaving & mid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers, which are not general MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI map translates general MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map which converts all the events of the Change patch to Bright Piano type into events of the Change patch to Trumpet type and thus always sounded a trumpet, if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one soundcard, you don't need a MIDI map, because all sound cards are GM -compatible (incl. Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI maps, so you have to edit the appropriate file by hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that stores all required settings for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the keymap section that may appear as often as desired. however, this requires that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define Keymap "The name of the Keymap..." END Define Keymap "A further Keymap..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">See that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an email so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can provide for devices that are not general MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section specifies how the patches of General MIDI are mapped to your specific keyboard. general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equality sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM-patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you must not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is needed to lay all the sounds that this instrument needs to play on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard does not support a gun for example (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which sounds similar to a gun shot.</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 (gun shot), it takes 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, no matter what sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that with the term drum patch the patch is meant to represent a different percussionary instrument (drum, cymbal, maracas & etc;) and not the one in which the sound represents the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards have).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to specify how tones are mapped on a specific channel or instrument. use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as is the presence. so, you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keymaps for each channel and instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keywords are used mainly to map sounds to the percussions-channel. see for example the included keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channel, do this in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for Keyboards, which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is mapped to the N channel. if you use the Keymap option, you will need to define the keyword with the name name for that channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events that try to change the patch on this channel will be ignored. in this case patch x will always be used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to use the percussions-patch on the percussions-channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio specifies in which ratio pitch-Bender events are multiplied. so if a MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender event with n, it is converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used to avoid decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM pretends that a keyboard that receives a pitch-Bender event with the value 4096 to play a tone higher. unfortunately, some Keyboards are trying to play two sounds up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you must try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. you can find this in the menu under Settings, Point MIDI Settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you can see which sounds are played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel. for each channel there is a drop-down list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the knob is no longer green, but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (until now) two different views to display the played tones. in the View menu, select View Channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed-LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains notes, rhythm, speed, & etc;. this allows the same MIDI file to perform on two different devices to very different results, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without AWE support. to fix the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example, kmid; 's start page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files separately.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Simply browse the folder you want to add to & konqueror;, select all files, and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Make sure to activate Automatic Add to the collection before. otherwise, the temporary files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key on the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow down playback. to restore the default tempo, double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have an & konqueror; -window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; open on this desktop (if I play a MIDI file) or if I want to play a karaoke file, I just have to change to the & konqueror; window and drag the file to the & kmid window.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection, turn the setting Automatically add to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. First you just want to play the first file. so set the setting Automatically add to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard, I encourage me to program.</seg>

<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level. if you click an entry, its group and all its subgroups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', television and permanent playlist can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files. of course you can only do this if & KMPlayer; not running. the different files in the directory ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer /, can be changed by an editor, from the View menu and next editing mode. by clicking a subgroup, only the XML content of this part is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you need to select Playlist from the drop-down menu and choose either the Edit Mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes will be lost if the editing mode is left or another group is selected without comparing it to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Because of the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during start and finish can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc and modifying [General Options] No Intro = 0 above option to '1'. if the option is not present, it can be simply inserted.</seg>

<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this rendition in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; everything must be configured through manual editing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc, such as setting the backend by mimetype. here is an example like a 'flash' played using the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played within & KMPlayer; it can even include the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">In order for the & KMPlayer to play 'flash' in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer must be specified as a service provider for the mime type application / x-shockwave-flash in the setup dialog file assignments of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; is in a console application to launch and search for error messages regarding loading the browser module library. if there are no errors, the Backend issue is within & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu to check).</seg>
<seg id="1726">In order to always take a given backend for a specific mime type (of course only if this has been calculated), this must be done through manual change of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc. for example, Phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play cards from TV, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be watched, the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured. for this, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To configure the VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog in the settings is under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo port. there should be detected ports from which one is selected. the encoding to use must be found (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably contains a dvb in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of SMEs can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this kind of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works). that's why the videoforlinux expansion for the XFree86 server must be in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config) the following:</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, various names are used by SMEs for the sources. at the time of the creation of this documentation, this is dvdNavsource, dvdsource, exitsource, FTP source, pipesource, tvscanner, TVSource, urlsource, vcdsource and vdrsource.</seg>

<seg id="1751">While here is only a good view to & latex; given, it is not the ultimate book about it. to exercise properly, good books should be used e.g. H. Kopka / P. W. Daly, A Guide to & latex;: document Preparation for Beginners and Advanced Users, 3rd Edition, 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1752">The introduction includes at least the command\\ documentclass, the body begins with the command\\ begin {document} and must be closed with the command\\ end {document}.</seg>
<seg id="1753">The quick-entry wizard of & Kile; is an useful function for fast creation of a document in & Kile; the selection of the wizard (menu) offers some possibilities for the creation of the document. there may also be some settings related to the document.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Document classes: this introduces the type of document to be created: article (article), book [book], letter [letter], report [scrreprt], report (DIN) [scrreprt], editor [scrreprt], Projector [Projector], Films [Prosper] or user-defined.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Encoding: this sets the character encoding. it should use the character encoding of the system. modern systems increasingly use the UTF-8 encoding as standard. at best UTF-8X should be used (for correct processing of the & latex; documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the most commonly used additional packages for and latex; for the integration they only have to be selected in the check box.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Article (DIN), book (DIN), report (DIN), letter (DIN): the document classes of Koma-Script (in compliance with German DIN regulations).</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users don't have to worry. it is only a short description of the functions and further information is given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& Kile; offers - as well as other source text editors - highlighting the commands, settings and elements (as well as the inappropriate). through & Kile, it is quite likely that some mathematical area has not been closed. however, it is noticed by the modest appearance of the output file.</seg>
<seg id="1760">When entering a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) from & Kile; automatically generates an empty line (for entering the text) and the corresponding line to the command line of the command (e.g.\\ end {command}). this function can be set in the Settings box... LaTeX commands are disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually divided into some elements. and latex; allows the subdivision of the document into the following elements (part is the most subtle and subparagraph the bottom element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files may be very helpful when searching for a DVI; file. as soon as a DVI; file is an independent file (engl. D e V ice I natively File)], jumps and boxes; by one click with the middle mouse button in the DVI; -viewer to the corresponding line in the & latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is besides PDF the usual output eart of & tex; or & latex; there are many tools to view, convert and to print DVI; files for various systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">Using the search search, the elements of the DVI; file are added to the editor and as soon as an element has been clicked into the DVI; file, the exact opposite is added. as soon as a section in the & latex; source code has been clicked, the corresponding position is jumped into DVI.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document, working with others is incorporated .tex files. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set to project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick construction: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (unless there are no errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">"" "video surveillance: in this mode, the DVI; file is" "" "wasted." "" "and there is no call from & eyepiece; after quick construction." ""</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the Edit tool bar, the three large selection fields should be noticed. the selection fields were developed for the fast classification of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... The available & latex; commands for subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection box More is for inserting items such as keywords, footnotes or references. the available options are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: this command creates a description for a section, an image, or a different element.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: used for reference to a specified term (select a selection box possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using Quote a selection list is displayed with literary entries. at & bibtex; this only works if the file belongs to a project. for editing of & bibtex; files are required corresponding editors. the author has good experience with & kbibtex; and & kb; files can also be written in & Kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last selector with the name GrÃ ¶ REE is used for the definition of the font. you can specify the fonts for the main text, the base notes, etc. the following fonts are available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & Kile; there are two options for selecting: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and specifying the settings. 2. the document can be written from scratch.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The parentheses under the command\\ documentclass contain the settings for the command. setting [12pt] specifies the font. if the font is not set at the beginning, this can also be done later in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">As soon as the above source code example has been entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the easiest way to do this is the use of the context of building or button quick construction.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved before compiling. & Kile; storage automatically executes.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If you fail to compile the document, you should be looking for errors in logging. if you use quick construction & eyepiece, it should be automatically started. if this is not the case, the logging should also be followed.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font E 12 is created and only a few columns are intended to have another font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} then allows the alteration of the font.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are considered only within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no restriction (number) for the changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the readability and usability of the document. for example, certain fonts, fat print, italics, submissions, etc. can be added. these commands end either with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the active pressure and is valid until it is closed with\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a set can be displayed recursively with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quote in the document. the quote begins with\\ begin {quote} and ends with\\ end {quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background for writing the source text with the & latex; markup language was presented, now follows a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & Kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">As soon as a bit of text has been entered in the assistant, some adjustments should be made for the better readability of the document. at least a quote, a few passages in the grease and spacitive pressure and a poem can be applied to see the differences between these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, an editor view or Ctrl E can be returned to the editor (internal viewer).</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI file is created, the document can be printed out or converted to a PostScript; / PDF file. just try and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an independent file format (engl. D e V ice I natively). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF converters or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI file, the same steps as for creating the document are necessary (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed with file printing (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The tool bar allows the conversion of the DVI file into other formats. as soon as the DVI, file was created from the & latex; source code, the conversion into desired other formats can begin by means of the buttons in the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The default search allows the direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; provides a corresponding setting for all & latex; bindings. for this purpose, only Modern can set up under Settings... Tools Construction to be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to search for the preselection, the mouse cursor has to be positioned in a row of the source text and then clicked on to select the template. the jump to the corresponding position in the DVI; viewer is then carried out.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & Eyepiece; with one click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the corresponding & latex; document of & Kile; opened and jumped to the corresponding line. to do this, & Kile; in & Eyepiece (setting up eyepiece... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If you do not open the & DVI file, an error may occur. if there is an error, this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The logging file explains the source code of the source code. in the editor you can use the LTeX errors and NÃ ¤chster LaTeX errors for jumps between errors. to view the defective line, you have to click on the error in logging and & Kile; jump to the wrong line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once clicked on the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document. the default options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting a blank document, a document can either be re-written or used for the quick creation of a new document. further information can be found in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Hands-like users of & latex; mostly use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created in & Kile; created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be opened or a new file is created. & Kile; can create a new template by sniffing an existing document and choosing file template from document...</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template by file New, some strings may be replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in Settings...</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by typing in document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ Documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {item}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. as soon as the document has been created this way, the following steps must be taken:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, your own template can then be chosen instead of the default options.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files. if an easy way to create a template is taken, search for an Internet search and follow the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kate; used & kate; as internal editor. & kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and highlighting many different types of text files (including also & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for & kate; can be done in the menu item directly from & Kile; out.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & rate; and its possibilities, the manual should be consulted to Kate. users of & Kile; can start working there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of & kate;</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very convenient & latex; command reference, which can be called via the MenÃ ¼ aid LaTeX reference. it contains an exclusive description of nearly all commands that can be found in & latex; use as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">A double-click with clicked Ctrl key to select the & tex; this means that in this way, when clicking the\\ par of\\ par\\ bigadskip is only\\ par.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with left mouse button pressed, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Using the arrow keys with pressed shift key, parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to search different types of source codes and to emphasize them. for example, the natural latex contains; -commands from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by a different color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can add additional jump marks. this is an own type of bookmarks within the text. the menu items Edit dive brands or the corresponding keys enable the jump to the next or last jump mark. this is also highlighted by this jump mark, so that it is automatically deleted at the first input of a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as & kile; although & kate; already excellent opportunities, have been added in & kile; important functions for writing a & latex; source code has been added; special commands for their selection. under Edit menu, the following commands for text selection are included:</seg>
<seg id="1817">Choose a complete paragraph (group of lines containing a blank line on both sides). this extended meaning includes tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source text. this extended meaning includes tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Select the word under the current cursor position. this selection also has an expanded meaning as this command also reads & latex; commands with a zip code (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">For reading a part of the document, it can be removed first and removed by pressing the Delete key. & kate; offers the keyboard shortcut Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. & Kile; with its own commands for a faster option.</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & Kile; is included in the description to the section Export Sale paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clarified that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, & Kile offers; for five more commands under Edit environment for one possible easy work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command jumps to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">This command jumps to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is located before or inside the\\ begin {environment}, it is jumped to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested environment commands, the remote view can be lost quickly. this command will close the last opened environment so that the nested surrounding structure will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also offers special precepts for the & latex group; groups specified by braces {...}. under Edit TeX group are a few important commands that match those from the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command jumps to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command jumps to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the curly closed clasp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is in front of or behind the curly clip of a & tex group #, the group jumps to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">In the input of many nested welded groups parentheses can be quickly lost. this command will close the last opened group, so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple instructions are used as a belt. for the appropriate conversion is used in & Kile; the sign "is used for two simple motion signs. also for the end of the application the sign" is used. & Kile; knows this case and holds two complete support signs for & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic entry of double quotes can be set up under Settings... LaTeX can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">It can also be used for specific settings (e.g. ngerman or French) and therefore German or French directions. many other languages can also be used.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When pressing Shift; input key for & Kile; an intelligent newline break. if the current position is within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & Kile; not only a line break but also the\\ item command.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Within a table environment, join & Kile; the current line with\\\\ with a subsequent line breaks off.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & Kile; is intelligent enough to support pre-set & latex; - or user-defined environments. these can be added under Settings...</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to arrange the columns in tables -environments and all Et characters (amp;) among each other. when pressing Shift; Alt; amp; search & Kile; after the next tab in the above line. although this tab is not the associated tab, add & Kile; some space for the columns positions of the current tab.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & kate; already provides a good source code completion, this has been extended in & Kile; for special commands (mostly for & latex;), three different modes are built. three of them work as needed and the other two are for different modes of work under Settings box... complete set.</seg>
<seg id="1839">When starting a new environment with the command\\ begin {environment}, & Kile; automatically add the command\\ end {environment} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the button, the last letter of the input will be removed and thus the complete list will be removed. on the other hand, the list can also shrink by entering a further letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. the descriptions are natally removed when selecting a command. alternatively, jump marks can be inserted, so that a jump to these positions is possible by editing jump marks Never Hock brand and the desired parameters can then be fed.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings... Kile; set up... Kile; complete adjustments can be made to these lists. there can be different types lists for & tex; - and & latex; commands as well as homeowners of the general language use will be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not useful for the completion of environments. it will always have a few letters to be entered with\\ begin and the call of completion mode will result in a large list of environment commands. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & Kile; a special mode for the completion of environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the completion mode over the menu Edit complete environment or the key / key Alt + Shift key, the command is automatically folded to the environment and it appears\\ begin {. afterwards, the environment can be resumed in an easy way and by pressing the input key can be completed.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is done, the environment is automatically closed again. as soon as & Kile; recognizes that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command is added.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings box; setting up... Kile; full adjustments can be made to these lists. this mode uses the list of completion mode for & tex; - and & latex; commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& Kile; supports custom lists of colds that can be replaced immediately by longer strings. the lists can be set up under Settings... Kile can be set up. as an example of a drop-down list, the file example.cwl, in which for example the L =\\ LaTeX entry is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is entered and the word completion mode is initiated over the menu Edit complete truncation or the key Ctrl + Alt spacebar, the letter L is replaced by the\\ LaTeX string.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Large roofs are not helpful for automatic completion. however, it has been found that many more people in a document are written more than once. thus, & Kile; the completion of all already written texts.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in the Settings box... Kile can be disabled completely. here, the threshold for the display of the completion can also be set.</seg>
<seg id="1851">The complete files can be installed in the ~ / .kde / share / apps / Kile / complete / fashion / Persons home folder. mode stands for Abbreviation, Dictionary (WÃ ¶ rterbuch) or tex.</seg>
<seg id="1852">The graphic design dialog box designs the layout of graphics as easy as possible. to view the basics of graphic formats, the sections should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS files are not as popular as PDF files but offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders of pages. if the PDF output is used, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; tools and then converted into a PDF file with ps2pdf.</seg>
<seg id="1854">To view the result of the work, you need to compile the source code. all the construction tools are compiled in groups in the MenÃ ¼ s Creating, Create, and Create view.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source code for viewer such as & eyepiece; or the further conversion can be used by the keyboard shortcut Alt; 2. afterwards, the DVI; file is converted into a PS file by means of Alt; 4 the DVI; file is converted into a PS file and viewed using Alt; 5 the PS file.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the Quick Build command, a viewer is usually called after compiling. if a viewer is not used, a new window will be opened each time.</seg>
<seg id="1857">A new project will be asked about the project "New Project...." the following information will be asked for the project:</seg>
<seg id="1858">When retrieving the file name window, the relative path must be specified by the .kilepr project file.</seg>
<seg id="1859">The script function of & Kile; allows executing ECMAScript code. scripts can be managed through scripts in the vertical bar.</seg>

<seg id="1864">This is not only a description of all programs (but a few important packages are described) but rather a complete instruction manual for the & latex; commands contain and is therefore ideal for finding a particular formatting. since this is a very large document, it is divided into & boxes; in three important bookmarks.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Due to the amount of documents with which & tetex; / texlive; delivered, finding the right document is not always easy. as possible help offers & tetex; / texlive; the small application texDoctk which contains a database with all files to & Kile; provided documents and for a graphical surface area.</seg>
<seg id="1866">All documents are divided into categories and the advantage is the search for package names or keywords. from & Kile, only the results are displayed.</seg>

<seg id="1929">The plug-ins, the & quantaplus, have with & quantaplus; even possibly little to do. this makes the plug-in system very powerful. you can immediately benefit from the additional functionality and do not have to wait until someone builds the fake in & quantaplus; plugins can be used in a large number of & GUI; elements. find out more about it below.</seg>
<seg id="1930">To install a plugin or a part, we start working with the Edit Plugins section. this will open the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows you to manage all contained plugins and add new ones. we describe each & GUI; element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plug-ins without a location & quantaplus; this path to search the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often work on a project several people in a kind of hierarchical relationship to each other. & quantaplus; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured using Shift; F7 Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the user's nickname and is used to uniquely identify.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member can have several roles in the project, as both team leader and sub-project leader.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can select from the list of team members who he is. this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the Setze button. the currently selected member (their identities) appears rich after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nickname and the setting of your own identity are important with regard to messages and annotations. see for further information on comments.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to an overview of their team, there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team: an event can be created for information to the team leaders when something particular happens. see for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something particular happens within the project. an example would be the recording of opening and closing the project so that later on, how much someone worked on it, or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that plays a file into CVS as soon as it is added to the project, etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the event configuration page of the Shift; F7 Project Properties dialog, events can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email will be sent to the addressees selected in the recipient list. the addressee may be a team or sub-project manager. see if such conductors will be set up.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Notes are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by the following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">Notes to be entered is simple. you can either select the comment -entry from the editor context menu or enter the @ annotation keyword in a comment area followed by comment text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Notes can be sent to a specific member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role) is part of the project from the following possibilities: team leader, Subproject Manager Following the area and sub-project leaders, the appropriate range or subproject names should be given, as shown in the following examples below.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roles names are independent of upper or lower case letters, but spaces around the brackets and the: make the comment invalid.</seg>

<seg id="1952">Optional tags automatically include: if checked, it is inserted for tags, for which the closing tag is optional, this immediately after the & gt;</seg>
<seg id="1953">Not include optional tags automatically: as above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Automatically update the start and end date: if enabled, the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic translation of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accentuated characters into the corresponding coding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: types of expression for recognition of different types of files. using the Standard Reset button, the default settings can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard character encoding: the encoding of newly created or otherwise than with file opening opened files (where the encoding of the file can be bypassed). this setting here is however ejected from the same in the project properties in case a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not recognized. however, this setting is removed from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; regularly creates backup copies, so that in case of a power failure or crash at the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup. this is not the same as saving the file. even for unsaved documents, a backup is created regularly, according to the set time.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in a separate view (or the documentation in a flashlight), which makes it possible to view the documentation, the preview and the source text at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Reset the window settings to the default when the user interface is changed by changing the MDI modes and docking / appending views. it corresponds to the --resetting command line parameter.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning message area is used to control the possibility to switch the display of warnings by hooks out of non-polluting.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The place to change the behavior of & VPL; it can be used to display symbols instead of scripts, as well as the VPL- and source code synchronization behaviour in shared mode. see the different modes.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree, representing the mapping of the parser nodes in the document, can be set in details.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the mouse click on the structure tree, it is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the area of structure tree settings, the visibility of nodes in the tree can be adjusted automatically when editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree. empty nodes are the empty areas in the text, while empty groups are such, where no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The area for setting abbreviations (a type of template) that unfolds when editing to a larger text. abbreviations are divided into groups, each can be valid for several & DTEP; this means there can be a valid group for PHP, in which the ifclause abdication means something else than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Plugins are KPart-applications from the third page, which can be reused by any part-enabled application, best known & konqueror; when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard as $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plug-in at startup, so it can open the current file, the associated folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Load component in "Read-only" mode: check if the plugin is denied loading. only Read-Lese-KParts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: if this is enabled, test & quantaplus; if the entered information is correct. select to save the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment, but it will be later installed.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, troubleshooting was completely redeveloped. support for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) Debugger was set, as well as support for the DBG Debugger. instead, a Debugger Plugin concept was implemented that allows different implementations via plug-ins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only a plugin is available, the support for using & gubed; inquantaplus; inserts.</seg>
<seg id="1975">Using the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger plugin in the project settings. with the Options button next to the Debugger-Plugin selection box, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all holding points are listed with line numbers and conditions. usually appears in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as in HTML) of the debugger is shown. usually appears in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to the debugger, if required, is produced, or it tells the plugin to listen to debugging requirements. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a debugger, so that normally does not have to be taken care of.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to Debugger session starts the session. includes the connection to the debugger or ends the listening to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends an HTTP request to the server to request a debug application. this is equivalent to using a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the Debugger display view.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the Debugger to start executing the script and continuously send information about the monitored variables and the current line. if this happens, while the script is stopped, the execution will continue. if this happens before a defile request has been started, the script will start with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without sending information to the monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens, while a script is stopped, execution continues. if this happens before a request is made, the execution starts as soon as a request is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger performs the next instruction in the script without entering the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The Debugger executes the next statement in the script, where possible in functions and include is purged.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instruct the debugger to pass the instruction and go to the next one as if it were not the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered, which is to be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">This dialog can enter a variable or set a new value of a variable.</seg>

<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how to adapt & quantaplus to your needs and how to help & quantaplus; help to become better.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document type Editing packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; provide support for brand and scripting languages as well as & CSS; they allow & quantaplus; their simplicity and flexibility power from & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s exist in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages respectively & CSS; & DTEP; s consist of two parts, the tag folder and toolbars. tag folders contain two file types, the file descriptionrc; and TagXML files with extension .tag. Toolbars are handy, symbolic buttons of image buttons (above the editing window), inserting text and instructions faster into a document than a user ever could.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see for details on conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how to create TagXML files, then the descriptionrc; and also toolbars. in short, one & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.day) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and the content of the Properties dialog, the & quantaplus; for the tag. file descriptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; itself. tool bars allow a fast insertion of tags into a document without the risk of typing error.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but folders. they contain only the descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folders bear the name of the description language and version, so present. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of TagXML and declares whether they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains nothing but a single element type above itself.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when using & lt; attr &gt; an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only valid for the class class. the name of the base class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs to. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has a common-attribute-group and the attributes within this tag can be added to any other day. (only family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes an attribute of a tag. this element can only be used once for each attribute. it specifies the name and type of the attribute. additionally, it contains other tags that describe how to display this attribute, etc; this is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source code used for filling for attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; is used to reach the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus; is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a interface and method name. the arguments passed to the method. can be empty or% tagname%, which means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag that groups together the elements of a list. it can only occur once for an attribute description. it is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog. this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each and lt; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tag to be defined. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements that end a tag. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All Tagged XML files must start with a & XML; declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces influence nothing, but pay attention to & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; tooltip &gt;, and lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt;. this will not cause a burst, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check TagXML files, the Tools dialog is at the top of the & quantaplus; window to start and check TagXML. another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, the check takes place only when loading the TagXML files in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">The following is an example of a family of 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the file name for this TagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">The following is an example of a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file, a & PHP; overload function is described. the file name of this TagXML file is to be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt; tag name = "overload" type = "function" returnType = "void" status = "optional" / &gt; & lt; / day &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The descriptionrc; file is just as easy and there is an editor for it, accessible via DTD Edit DTD settings. this can be edited for a file descriptionrc; for a newly created & descriptionrc; for a newly created & descriptionrc; should be created a simple descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = User 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD specification. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set with Settings... to create. click New Action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The keyboard shortcut assigned to this action. by clicking on the User Language button, a shortcut can be assigned; with Keiner the current keyboard shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. you can enter a text in the Detaied Settings and when executing the action, this text will be inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that modify the document or use it as input (or parts of the document) can be started. examples from & quantaplus; even are the quick start dialog or the different See in... actions for the (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in command line, such as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. In this way, $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variables that can be used in command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we are replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document, file: / from the document name will be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with PID of the current & quantaplus process. if only one instance runs, the text unique is added to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document, or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above mentioned methods, a script can be provided by & quantaplus; in the input field input can be specified, which is to be sent to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The output of the executed application can also be redirected according to the input. there are two types of output: normal output, written to the default output; error messages are passed to the standard error output. it can be specified, which should be done with the text written to the standard output, by setting the value of the selection box output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create an own toolbar for each group. in the given case, it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the markup.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar has been added, you need to add and configure actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. pressing the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Complete all necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and, if the tag has attributes and you plan to use them, enable dialogue "Edit day" when available so that an input is possible when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol? let us replace it before we have trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that represents the action better, we will use & kiconedit; select from the & KMenu;, Graphics More Programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconcurrently; uses 32x32 pixel by default, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the fact that the day starts, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green will usually appear as loose, stiff, further interpreted), or at least, a message to the user will be signaled that clicking this symbol will insert; start; -tag in the current document will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol, it still needs to be connected to the action. this is done through the menu with settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. next to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored icon is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags, so there are still some, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; add functions to the tool bar or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview by some separators. open the tool bar set up dialog on Settings tool bar. make sure the tool bar you want is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I would like to select the separator (at the top left) for my toolbar. after selecting the element that should be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to have a quick way to access the Konqueror Preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separators support the grouping. someone who doesn't know my toolbar could believe that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar has to be tested by trimming all the symbols to make sure everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">After NeweXML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the proper folder. please adjust your file descriptionrc; so that your toolbar (s) will be loaded when a file is opened from the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable expansion of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for the scripting language or formatting language that you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how to create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you might be able to check in & quantaplus; repository whether someone has done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to search for an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file. we will leave the first part to you, we will handle the second one here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE Configuration File [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, for documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for the func1, func1, func1 = func1.html _ func1 = func1.html tag3 = tag2.html tag3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The Tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you now see in the & PHP; documentation so somewhat:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started,... Introduction = Precau.html... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntac.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # in front of Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolders in the tree with its own content. there is no known boundary for the depth of the shaft (except by reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top of the tree view & mdash; folder is shown!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing, but pay attention to & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file that is used to create context-sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; script should display the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. by selecting the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context help, the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file linking lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of contextual elements that are supposed to be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc easily and save to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as specified in your docrc file) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. what documentation was used to the & quantaplus; repository for use by the & quantaplus; community. you won't be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the scattered resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or else. at different places there is an Email menu entry such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email sending, toolbar buttons with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive from where all other & quantaplus users can download them. the contributions are reviewed and only made available when our team is looking for them as correct and useful for publication. to make a little contribution we recommend to sign the resources, both for our team as well as for the future users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When you upload, you will be asked for your passphrase for your private gPG key (the passphrase is not saved), or if you have multiple keys, you can fill in the input fields (the URL preview can be empty) and click OK to start uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD DTD package (DTEP), toolbar toolbars, and started in the context menu of files and folders in the Templates and Scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, check & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by examining the integrity and signing. in case of problems it warns and it can then be stopped. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the indication of the source of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages currently not yet available by & quantaplus; however, creating a DTEP package can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files in tag XML format might be needed. there is a simpler way to automatically convert a DTD into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD loading and converting a DTD. choose the .dtd file with the DTD description to use. then the following dialog will appear:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype definition line: the string that should appear in the! doctype day like HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of DTEP after conversion: when enabled, & quantaplus; after conversion the descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; can be adjusted. it is recommended to use this possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus; there are some key concepts. in order to understand this and to be able to draw full benefits, one must first familiarize oneself with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to bring these concepts to them precisely, without their understanding & quantaplus; little use.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and project related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone who uses & quantaplus; it stores everything that is marked globally in the shared folder structure of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool tracks, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory, so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a particular project. this can be anything from & CSS; patterns to toolbars with special actions specially for the files of a particular project. simply put, this is the most limited size. all elements are placed in the folder tree of the project, which embelligerates the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the tree views, the tabs with information and the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the tabs with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document appropriate entries, such as closing, recharging, deleting or uploading the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the editor pane to create a further context menu regarding the edited document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / paste / paste), edit the tags under the mouse cursor or open the file when the string is named a file under the mouse cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editor window are the tool bars of the editor. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional is the default for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of the further expansion of & quantaplus, the tool bars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of tool bars is really easy. if you want to insert a simple day, e.g. & lt; insert into your document, then click on the symbol that represents the tag. now you can insert the data for this just inserted day. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (such as anchors), you can fill in different fields in a dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The tree views (QIT;) make it possible to navigate in the information to & quantaplus; navigate, open it and roam. in the display with tabs are available for files, project, pattern templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view shows all files in the project and allows to manage the files in the project by right mouse click. actions such as add, remove, upload or delete the files from the storage medium can then be executed with the context menu displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be grouped into three categories, depending on what context they are used. the category hinges on & quantaplus; global templates are always available, local templates only for the respective user and templates in projects can only be used in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of integration in Global, Local and Project works also here. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the available information into a script. with the right mouse button further functions are available, such as starting, editing, or sending with email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by clicking on an element opens a list of commands related to navigation and refresher of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree views. with it, you can quickly change attributes and namespaces. the application system oriented to the content allows you to change all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development to be found. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be added, edited and considered project-specific documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus, two tabs at the bottom of the window, can be accessed through the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab displays information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to the DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the current document markup. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; tool bars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they get the appropriate command displayed. the chocolate page of the toolbar is the option to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a tool bar with email. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as compressed Tar archive via & kmail;. if you receive a toolbar in an email, you can back up and load it in & quantaplus; like any other toolbar!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the place of the & quantaplus; files on your system. to do this, autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems starting from & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & node; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that there is no older version of & kde; 3 in the PATH in front of its bin folder. the same goes for & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE interface. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During the effort to create the best & HTML; editor, the developers of & quantaplus started to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quantaplus; an independent, expandable markup language editor? well, this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then should & quantaplus; for this the suitable & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the aforementioned claim must be stated that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & node; developer community based. & quantaplus; following, in good use of free software, the idea of Why Developer, & quantaplus; it allows users and developers to expand & quantaplus; so to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document interface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by means of self-deleted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation is possible almost every task.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and quickly expanded to a sophisticated editor with many powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way connected to commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers abandoned the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More in the details-going documentation is with help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; type, or use khelpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list changes each time you open a file that is not on it, and the oldest record is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use. if you are trying to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts any special characters contained in the clipboard from the clipboard, so that they appear correctly and are not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard to & URL; -Schumpy, which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. primarily to insert & URL; s used in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection on or off. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift; key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Goes directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; script releases error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Search a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a sort of grep or sed with GUI and pre-defined expression to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window where you can see the display of script actions and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Switch on and switch the problem reporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as you change to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol column to the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with the entries Previous or Next, depending on the position of the cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu grouped by the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard drive. & quantaplus; projects are stored with the extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this allows for example to copy graphics files into your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Loads the files in your project on the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde, and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings such as & quantaplus; the project manages. in chapter & quantaplus; Projects you will find the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project toolbox. these are stored in project Dir / toolbars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your tool bar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Open a dialog to add a new toolbar. this creates only the name. actions need to be set by setting actions... to be added. toolbar buttons are saved through toolbar buttons, or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. it does not delete it from your hard drive. if you haven't saved the toolbar, you'll be asked if you want to do it.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team so that the toolbar will be present in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as attachment.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows to upload tool tracks to the main server, where everyone else can access it.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Loading a & DTD; which you or anyone else has made and convert to the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it is useful if the entities from the DTEP are to be refreshed without the whole & DTEP; if this is global and there is no write permission in the global KDE folder, the loading fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbar. if the standard (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a sub-menu standard in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current tag creation dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags menu followed by & DTD; -specific sub-menus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">At present, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent inserting means that & quantaplus; inserting by tool bar is denied if this tag contradicts the rules at this place.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plugin menu the available plugins are listed under the menu items listed above. click on them. click on an activated plug-in deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Selects the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on derkate; version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Choose the type of line-end identifier. very useful when you know people using other OS platforms for developing. select Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Check the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Instantaneous switching between the different types of user interface. due to some restrictions in the KDE libraries, the switch can sometimes need time or create unnice graphics. the flashcard mode, which is also the default setting, or subwindow mode, which is the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu provides an entry for each open subwindow. by selecting an entry, the corresponding subwindow will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Enables the display of the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog influence every application that uses the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Set the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of & kate; you will find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears where you delete entries from the toolbar, or add and modify the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help according to the context of the mouse-pointer, but is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project, developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom, as e.g. after filling the project name the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically. all these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift; F7 Project Properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project to enter, for example foo. when entering the name, file is filled in automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with the extension webjj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access, except you edit local data. either a name (hostname.exempl.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocol are used. depending on the remote host setting, an adjustment might be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local file system into the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. for server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">If a project is started from scratch, do not hook if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2165">This option displays all files and folders within the main folder and you can make an exact selection according to your preferences.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by hook or, by removing the tick, clip out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be changed in the menu with Project Properties in the menu tree in the sub-window profiles, or by Shift; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (wildcards possible), which are ignored for project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional options to the top, including files listed in .cvsignore, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view that is loaded when the project is opened can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The desired debugger can thus be selected. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Guild can be found in. the debugger plugin can be set using the Options button. the debugging plugin is described in.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the Profile upload window, upload sections (see in) can be set as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by tilting its own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the team configuration subwindow, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration subwindow, you can turn on event actions and add, modify or delete event actions. event actions are executed when a previously defined event occurs, such as the backup of a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus opens; the last project that was opened. you can't influence this behavior at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select Open Project... from the Project or Open Project from the toolbar. the Open Project dialog is displayed and allows selection of a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quantaplus is closed, the project file will be saved automatically. you'll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project tree view gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behave as well, but the entries are not opened and open with... in the context menu which can be found with the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removal of the current profile. if only one profile is present, the button will be blinded to prevent removing.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in the kernel and forgotten when it comes to programs. this option is useful if you need a frequent upload of files and the rather unsecure password will not be available on the disk.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many high-loading profiles can be created and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog displays:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to which the files are to be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. normally, this does not need to be changed unless the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your fear threshold, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use it after your discretion. the password is stored concealed on the disk, so it cannot be read easily, but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only one set of files and toolbars. there can be many views in a project, i.e. by simply swap the view, various files and toolbar buttons can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved, opened, or deleted from the Project or Project toolbar, accessible via Settings tool bar Project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; this helps not only increase productivity, but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus to its own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above, toolbars in & quantaplus are best stackable through the toolbar. use and add differ. adding tool bars will be listed below in the Add tool section section.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the icons can be set using either context menu (right-click on the toolbar), other actions such as toolbar buttons, toolbar buttons or toolbar buttons can be executed, which will be shown in the dialog where it can be specified which actions to be visible on this or other tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a toolbar, the entries action will be removed and action processed, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbar and actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings toolbars... and Setting Settings... setting.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are basically document skeletons, code schnitzel and files for linking. & quantaplus; basically uses templates such as a common file system with advanced organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or link any directory existing in the system into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the limitations you submit for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; templates supplied have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary is all that is not pure text. it can be any file except text, i.e. images, & PDF; s, flash files & etc. binary templates are usually inserted in documents using links (e.g. images with img src = / src / url).</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be from any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. normally, more specific documents are found in corresponding subfolders. you make a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in a proper way to be efficient. see for more information on template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template but the same text area. you can include everything from a comment on a final mark to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl-based. see for more information on template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates are used for entire websites as templates. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure as desired (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and choose File As template save As a local template store....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this is done, notice that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As template save option to save as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can simply be dragged with dragging and dropping to the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied to a template folder. all file management functions can be used for this, such as pulling and dropping or inserting over the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can select tree view on a folder to the right of the file tree or in the project file, enter a name for the template and back up. by default, it is backed up in the project folder, but of course it can also be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates allow a very goal-oriented approach. you can specify headers and footers or dynamically combine them with & PHP; design, insert files or link them with them. in addition, you can keep a few things in mind when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files submitted in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates. each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of container, as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder in the template overview with the right mouse button click on the folder and select Properties from the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is dazzled as soon as elteral attributes are inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits for everything except for the root folders in the template overview. if a root folder is set, it would generally disable templates in this path except they would be explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder the blah would appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows prefabricated or copied text for templates in this folder. this could be general headers or footers for all templates for a particular project and allows to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate headers / footers by copying contents into a folder with special headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have the context menu (pointing to right mouse button) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and pasting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; provides two modes: VPL; Editor and VPL; & Source text editor that can be reached via the View menu. the first mode replaces the source text editor with the VPL; Editor and the second divides the editor window into two parts: the source text editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; Editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor. then you can edit and turn back to the source code editor, where the changes made in the VPL; Editor are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; Editor on a document, that & PHP; contains, a small green symbol indicates the Vohanddefault of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; editor. to edit & PHP, the source code editor is still necessary. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that the changes are visible both in the source code editor and the VPL; editor, and the cursor in the source text editor and the VPL; editor is activated, this mode is already active, the keypress moves the active cursor from one window to another, while maintaining the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between VPL; Editor and source text editor is customizable via settings Quanta. choosing VPL; view can be selected between synchronization with one click or automatically. in principle, the time span can be adjusted. in principle, the recommendation is: a small span for fast computers and a large span for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Assuming that you want to change the title of the website, it is possible to select document properties. this makes it possible to edit invisible tags when working with the VPL; Editor. the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document is created using the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click on the list allows to change the content, such as keywords on the column name and keyword 2 keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in your browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons under the list. a change over the list is possible just like with the meta elements. editing CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style sheet by pressing the File Open button and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursor is possible as in a word processor, by moving with the arrows. in rare circumstances the cursor behaves as usual. text can be inserted by typing and deleting by means of reset button or distance key.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way through the toolbar, as in the source code editor. note that inserting tags before already existing identical tags is not removed e.g. when an anchor tag is inserted with text, any other surrounding anchor tag needs to be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbar buttons, such as the Tables Assistant or the Listen-Assistant, are disabled. they will work later in & VPL; in this release, the tables or lists need to be used toolbar buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for investigation of style sheets. in contrast to other style sheets, the search for certain elements is possible and the style of the style sheet can be followed.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & kdiff3;? let me explain briefly why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors had made many changes and at the same time had corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts during merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me only showed me the modified lines, but I couldn't see what exactly changed within these lines. and there was no clue to the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a little nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, any number of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare text quickly, simply copy it to the clipboard and paste it into one of the comparison windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that did a lot of work was comparing and merging folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful when two persons work independently from each other on a piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the result you expect. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; displays the exact differences and resists the possibilities of current color monitors. if you frequently need to check Kode, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visibly. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters, you can see this at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side. (no more anger if somebody changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is the same and the other is different from one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both are different.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name, but are in different folders, you can make typing easier by simply writing the filename of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Share folder 1 folder 2 shared folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 -o target folders</seg>
<seg id="2294">The Open dialog allows the manual typing of file names, the selection via the file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list. the Open dialog registers your selection and displays it again next time. you don't need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of differences with two files is performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Through the Folder button... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, however, the comparing or merging folders will be initiated. however, if a file is selected for A, then use & kdiff3; the file name from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When merging is enabled, the input field is active for target and can be edited. however, it is not necessary to immediately specify a output file. you can also do this later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The set-in button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can specify options before you start comparing / merging.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you do not want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in the open dialog you don't have to select any files, you can close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What is the idea behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, this would be a relatively large effort. you would need to create two appropriate files, you can upload them into & kdiff3; now you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you can't extract anything from & kdiff3; only dropping text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpreting and pasting text into another program as cutting and pasting (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data might be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that Windows C is optional.) Each info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, leave the mouse over the line for a while. then a small help window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed using the settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is detected, you can see the color, which file is different. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflict in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files. this is good to see in the next section (merging).</seg>
<seg id="2306">When differences are found, the column shows the corresponding color. in some programming languages, where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + + e.g. white characters are only relevant in strings and commentaries, for the preprocessor and in a few, rare isolated cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line separating the binding column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines. if the line breaks is enabled, the line will be dotted with broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparison window) also has an info line with the Wording Edition:, the filename and [Gee] if you edited the result. usually, it already contains text by automatically merging, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts have been resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the buttons to find the next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, each difference is also a conflict which needs to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the group belonging to the line will be marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. (this will also indicate a jump in the position in the windows, where the start of the group would otherwise not be visible.) This group will then be highlighted with the color background color for current pane and each on the left a black beam will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic merging or manual editing; this is only a substitute for the case that you change your mind and maybe yet choose another source. this text does not appear in the final saved file, nor in a marker that you may copy and insert somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflicted; however, appears in the clipboard, if you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if the sources ignore the numbers or ignore Ignore C / C + + comments when selecting the sources, changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mostly with the scroll bars and mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, page on, page from, beginning, end, Ctrl-beginning and Ctrl-End, Siw as you can also be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the output window, you can also use the other buttons for editing. with the Insert button you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with left mouse button in one of the summary columns will synchronize the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as already explained in the merge section and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous difference (Ctrl-Down / Ctrl-Image Abbackward) or to the next / previous conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the mark to the clipboard, you must copy the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Paste). if enabled, you will automatically copy whatever you mark, automatically copied to the clipboard and no manual copying. be careful with this option because you could accidentally override the clipboard content.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix variants use a line feed character\, and Win32-based systems use cart return + line feed\\ r\. KDiff3 keeps the line end of the source files, therefore you should not use & kdiff3; also not with binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically when you exit and restore them at the next start. (Setting menu Setting up &gt; KDiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">(on some systems, the dialog also displays fonts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences in italic text are displayed. if the chosen font doesn't support this display, nothing happens at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rendered rendered. on these systems, the Preferences button automatically displays an unaltered color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is checked, the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when the tab key is pressed. otherwise, a tab character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press input or return, the indentation of the previous line is automatically also used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is checked, each selection is automatically copied to the clipboard. then the manual copy to the clipboard is omitted.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line end type you prefer for saving. the default value is the generally usual selection on the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, & kdiff3 tries to find all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. the second step compares each line. in this step, white characters are not ignored. even when merging white characters are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a character '\\ r' and a newline '\' at the end of a line, while others save only one line feed '\'. if this option is checked, you will be treated with different sizes in the page-by-side comparison. if enabled, this option has to be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the default setting, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated as white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2332">This option is disabled in default. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Search for even smaller differences. the option is enabled in default. it is effective for complicated and large files, but slow for very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In Automatically advanced skipping mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next unresolved conflict is continued.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Automatically solves all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important. if you only need this from time to time then use better the functions Choose A / B / C for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the Automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments enabled, if the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are treated in the chapter to scan folders and execute a merge. see documentation for directory comparison and merging for details.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and an older version already exists, the original version will be appended to the suffix .orig. if such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adjust the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current running program. you must & kdiff3; quit and reboot to make the change active. (this option is not available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set globally via the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Above the selection fields for encoding a short notice is displayed, which is the local encoding. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Customize the file encoding for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different encoding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding should be used to save.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files may be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of pre-processing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn off this to suppress highlighting of changes in white characters in text or review columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignore Ignore C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode all differences are displayed in a color coded oversight column. but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files. after selecting A & lt; & gt; C or B & lt; C is displayed next to the normal still a second oversight column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you would like to use the space available on the screen for long lines. just hide the less important windows. (this option is in the Windows menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the Windows menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you look at the differences and then decide to merge the files. a simple click will merge the merge and use the file name of the last source file as default name for the output file. (if this function is used to start merging again, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it is first given to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own pre-processor that exactly matches your needs. you can use this function e.g. to cut out disturbing parts or correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is first given to this external command. if a normal pre-processing command is also specified (see above), the output of the command is used only when the line is aborted. you can write your own pre-processor which corresponds exactly to your needs. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results. but for this an external program is needed, and most users don't want to program that themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl are completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command for newlines to convert the input into uppercase letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ U\\ 1 /\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically insert created strings (info: / cvs / keyword substitution). all of them follow the same pattern $keyword generated text $. now, a pre-processing command is needed for line synchronization, which removes the automatically generated text:\\ $\ $\\\\\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you may begin to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example of another pre-processing command for line synchronization. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each character between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and each hit is replaced by nothing so virtually deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several replacements at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the replacements. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something else such as perl -p -e's / regexp / replace / SCHALTER'However, perl needs a few details. where sed\\ (and\\) is needed perl only needs (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor will be retained for display and merging. the other operations only change the data that the newline algorithm sees.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when using a normal preprocessor, the newline pre-processor sees the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences, you may not accidentally notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit a lot of files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge entire folders recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a suggestion for each object to merge; you can adjust the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate cooperations and display simulated changes without actually performing them,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging individual files. you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as the base. if no destination folder has been specified, use & kdiff3; folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically, not merging. to start merging, you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (see more details.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, a small message window informs you about current progress. if you cancel the scanning of the folders, only the files that were compared until then will be listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folders is complete, it displays & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually displayed together. you can open a folder by double-clicking on the + / - or by double-clicking on the object, or by double-clicking the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions to fold up all subdirectories and open all subdirectories with which you can open or fold up all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double-click a file, the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders then this is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the coupling action cannot be selected automatically. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed of problems of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As can be seen in the picture above, the colors red, green, yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In identical entries the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical. then folders have the same color. in folders the age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf which is only green, then yellow and later, when it is old, becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such incorrect objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such incorrect objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The synchronization mode is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified, and if the option synchronize dirs is active. then choose & kdiff3; the necessary action so that both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but are not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as the visible file name for the output file only B; copied directly after merging & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and the option New file is selected instead of merge (unsafe), then examines & kdiff3; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy. if the files are different, but the date is identical.. Solange such errors are not removed, the merging of the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While merging, one file will be processed after another. you indicate the status column when merging succeeds, and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurs. if the merge is complete, you should make a final check and see if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">When a full analysis is selected in the setup dialog, KDiff3 will display more columns. these contain the number of unresolved, resolved, non-white and white conflicts. (the dissolved conflict column is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected record (file or odds), or all entries at once. if you have selected all connection actions (also in all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have not specified a destination folder, then in the Three-Folder Merge mode C is used as target, B is chosen as target and when synchronizing A and / or B is used as target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please verify that all entries that should be in the destination folder will also be displayed in the folder structure. there are some options to skip certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select folder merge start / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the shortcut). to select only the current item, select action from the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If the conflicting file types still exist invalid merging actions, a message appears indicating the incorrect elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog box appears with the Options, Sizing and Sitting.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Choose Simulate if you would like to see what would happen without actually making any changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then performs certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merging a single file), a merge window opens (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you are finished with a file, select / continue directory merge again, or press F7. if you haven't saved yet, a corresponding dialog will appear. then proceed & kdiff3; its work continues with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; click on an error, a message appears and detailed status information. at the end of the list, you will see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem. if you continue the merge (F7 key), you have the option to try another action for the entry or solve the problem in a different way before proceeding with merging.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries were brought together individually, you notice & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) do not merge them again. even if the merge operation was skipped or not saved, these entries will be considered completed. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The settings menu of & kdiff3; (menu settings - &gt; KDiff3...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree. multiple patterns can be entered. separate the pattern with a semicolon;. valid wildcards: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders don't have to match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one sample, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcards: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one sample, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcards: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignores files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autmatically created files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this can be configured specifically with a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a hidden attribute. in other filesystems, a preceding dot indicates a file as hidden. this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">If the option is switched off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is turned on, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">If the option is turned on, the links will be treated like normal folders and recursively searches. (note that & kdiff3; if the option is turned on, a link to a link that contains a link on itself would result in an infinite loop and & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns. (the number of dissolved, unresolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files that do not contain any text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders through a slow network, it might be faster to compare only the change date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security. please use caution. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the change date. there is no true comparison. the files are considered identical if they are equal. this can, for example, be useful when copying the change date. please use caution. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates the synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging are selected so that afterwards both folders are identical. also the results of merging files are stored in both folders. this option is switched off in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging, copying the newer file is suggested as an action. (this is considered unsafe because it is assumed that the other file was not also changed.) This option is disabled in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, the original version will be renamed and will get the extension .orig. If an old backup file with the .Gregg extension already exists, it will be deleted without further backup. this also applies to the normal merge of individual files, not only merging entire folders. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder Merge view will remain visible to the merge of individual files; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want this, you can switch off the directory and text windows option in the main window in the window menu and switch between the directory and text window between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You may prefer to merge a single file directly by double-clicking. you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge. as soon as you save the result, the status will be reset and the file will not be merged again if you start the folder merge.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost when you re-read the directory: directory -Menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open, which are located on local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. a few things should be noted:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. .This is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, empty string &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes because of the file system on the server, sometimes through the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it can't be distinguished whether a link indicates a file or a folder. then always a file is accepted as a link destination. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or change date. therefore, the permissions or the date of change deviate from the original. (note the option Confidential of the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is at present as a difference viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP always starts the built-in difference viewer. to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button over the differences viewer and then select In KDiff3Part display from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Usually requires & kdiff3; two full input files. however, if it is used as a KPart, then & kdiff3; the name of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then starts & kdiff3; the patch program to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Conqueror, you can click on a patch file and from the context menu Preview in - KDiff3Part. note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable when the original files have changed since the patch file was created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & kdiff3; when executed as part, it only supports the comparison of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now it's called Kompare) are already available. furthermore, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff3 from the Diff Tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs very long and learned a lot by looking at the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this way or have it to go that way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from the sources and probably didn't tell the configure script to KDE. in default, configure installs in / usr / local, but then KDE can't find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kde3ui.rc). in the README file you will find further information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are treated as identical. however, if only a non-white character is different, the line is treated as not identical. iF similar lines, next to each other, this is acc. to this and is often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notes for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. this is necessary to simply resolve a conflict by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C. however, this important information is lost when the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">You can always recover a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger volumes of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is abruptly; no src is left; and the text cannot be deleted. what does this mean and how can it be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses already many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and misses the purpose. please use another editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">In order to use all functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how you can use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of the latest changes can be found under http: / / kde3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the file ChangeLog in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To use & kdiff3; on a system with & kde; to compile and install, use the following command in the base folder of the & kdiff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir provides the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake are used, you should not have any trouble compiling. however, if difficulties persist, please report to the & kde; mailing lists of it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift-Remove) to the clipboard and delete the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift Insert) insert the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position respectively replace the current selection.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Show only differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you will need to re-read the folder with the Update function after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">This also causes identical files to not be copied to the target folder when merging. if the target folder doesn't already contain these files, they are missing after merging. (the behavior is likely switched off in a later program version.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the caption A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window will be appended to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present). if the lines are already present, they will be removed when you click on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In the default setting this option is disabled. different characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; displays a thumbnail of all virtual desktops. it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the work surfaces, change their size, stop them or postpone them. this works both inside a desktop and multiple.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual desktops as well as the applications running in it. the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & nbsp; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other work surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty background of & Kpager; clicked, the context menu only has to set up the two entries Pager... and exit. however, if an application within & Kpager was clicked, the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minimize, maximize, on Desktop and exit.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows can be moved within the & nbsp; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">If this field is checked, the name of the virtual desktops will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this field lets the & Kpager; display the numbers of virtual desktops. if it is ticked together with name, the names are provided with folder numbers, & eg; 1st Desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is checked, the background of each desktop will also be displayed as background in the pager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is checked, the running programs will be displayed as small windows in the window. otherwise only the empty workspaces will be displayed to allow their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon displays the windows with their default icon and Pixmap displays a small view of the real program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">The layout of the pager; the main window can be determined: classic lets & pens; in a 2xN grid appear, as is known from Pager applications in some other window managers; horizontal shows all virtual desktops in a horizontal and vertical row, which is very good for presentation on the side on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager mini-program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size that can display and move windows as symbols or with their contents. furthermore, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click within & Kpager; and set up the selector switch... allows the dialog to appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. If you do not have write permission for the file, you must log in as user root or turn to your system administrator. in this file you must enter the key windowtransparency fashion and assign values to it. possible values are:</seg>

<seg id="2481">& kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly being extended with new features. it is optimized for use on low-performance computers.</seg>
<seg id="2482">The main window of & kmag; displays the enlarged area of the screen. in the following, this window is called a magnification window. the image that appears in the magnification window is an enlarged area of the screen and is described below as a selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In the default setting augmented & kmag; the area around the mouse pointer as a moving pin. alternatively, you can & kmag; this causes a select screen area in the magnification window (selection window mode) or the surroundings of the mouse pointer at the edge of the screen (eg; on the left edge of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid that the mouse pointer is displayed in the enlarged window, select the mouse pointer setting. please note that & kmag; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse-pointer. this is always the default kde; / Qt; mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the selection window mode, you can customize the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse pointer in the magnification window and keep the left mouse button pressed, so you can capture and move the content of the magnification window. this also goes with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you press the & Shift key additionally, or use the & MMB; you can move the selection box.</seg>
<seg id="2488">This combination allows you to change the size of the selection window. note that the upper left corner of the selection window is fixed and only the lower right corner is to move.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& kmag; owns a lot of functions. you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer, save it to a file, copy it to the clipboard (to insert it later into other applications), rotate the image and more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Start or stop the display update. stopping the update will cause the CPU time needed to stop 0.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Select the refresh rate (Very low, Gering, Medium, High, Very High). the higher the update rate, the more CPU time is needed.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click as soon as the mouse pointer stays on the same spot. it is intended to help people suffering from the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and which each mouse-click causes pain.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain that arises when you click the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, pain caused by your computer may also cause pain. if you suffer from pain associated with your computer's use, you should consult a doctor if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear: even if & kmousetool; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse, it is useless against soreness caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic aids, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitor your mouse movements and execute a mouse click once you interrupt the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the intelligent shift is activated, do & kmousetool; pause after pressing the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the end of the motion before the release of the mouse button is executed. in this way, you can do pulling with pressed mouse button. the intelligent shift requires a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement, before & kmousetool; a mouse click will execute.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intelligentes shift is enabled, the shooting range is active (1 / 10 s). here the time is set, the & kmousetool; after pressing down the mouse button waits, before it release the mouse button again, if no moving of the mouse occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports clicking through mouse shift. if this feature is activated, a slow moving to the right and back, followed by a pause, a click with right mouse button. a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click. these movements are stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ plankes.txt, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound appears delayed, you can & kde; move to reduce response time. open the & kcontrolcenter; go to Sound & Multimedia, select sound system and here the General tab. there is a slider sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shorten response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, it will start & kmousetool; at each start of & kde; this function is currently only available at & kde; for GNOME or other window environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program there automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Resets all settings to the values set when opening the dialog. if you have already pressed the Apply button, the settings are reset to the stand after pressing Apply.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first of all with presets. in particular, if you get used to the automatic mouse click, you can later accept the intelligent shift.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it might be necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; in case of sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First of all you should make aware of which places a mouse click remains without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window that do not represent a link does not lead to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually quite simple. the trick is that you don't only clean the hemisphere, but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to take the mouse ball out. how this happens is different from mouse to mouse. however, it should be clear when you look at the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you'd have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. you can easily scrape the dirt and dirt with a flat blade or a fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you have just started a move. if you use the intelligent shift, this means that the mousetool; the operation can no longer be stopped by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens if you & kmousetool; use under another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution to this problem is that you have a mouse click. this will reset the status of & kmousetool; and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you type text, try and kmousetool; continue mouse clicks and set the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want it. but use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to make a keystroke. secure zones for the mouse-cursor are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbar buttons and menus and the title lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with intelligent shifting, but I don't make it to edit lyrics.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent shift is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very probably possible to copy text, copy it to the clipboard and execute any other action, where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. however, it will probably only cause problems. here are some advice:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use intelligent shift if you just start and kmousetool; use. instead, drag a mouse click at one end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and then press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this will always play when & kmousetool; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when when moving the move time begins. later you can use the intelligent shift without the audible mouse click. but this requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To be able to use & kmousetool, the XTest extension for & X Window needs to be installed. that should be the case on most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and is set up correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; activates the mouse button as soon as the mouse pointer stays short. this program has been developed for people suffering from RSI syndrome and who pain the bedside of the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured to wait a certain time waiting for a pulling process to start before the mouse button is released. in this way, dragging and dropping can also be done with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2531">With the program & kmouth, dumb users can let the computer speak for themselves. the user can choose from a list with the conversation history sentences that are to be spoken again.</seg>
<seg id="2532">On the first page of the wizard (left screen shot) enter the command which will later be used for the speech output of text. further details can be found in the description of the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2533">On the second page, select the default text passbook. from the text passbooks, you can often select used text passages without typing them. of course, the text passages can be edited.</seg>
<seg id="2534">On the third page (right screen shot), you determine the dictionary for the word completion. & kmouth; reads the KDE documentation of the selected language to determine the frequency of each word. in addition, you can synchronize the word lists with an OpenOffice.org dictionary so that only properly literate words are included in the wordboard.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The main window of & kmouth; is clear and includes an input field for the keyboard input of your movements (the bottom white field in the screenshot) and a memory of the already spoken sentences (the upper white field in the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2536">If you have set your mouth, you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field. each spoken set is appended to the memory channel. you can select sets that are to be spoken again.</seg>
<seg id="2537">With the menu entry Settings kmouth; set up... open the settings dialog from & kmouth; this dialog contains two flashcards, voice output and settings, page word completion as well as the KTTSD language service page.</seg>
<seg id="2538">In the input field of the voice input voice output, type the command to call the language generator. in the selection box below the input field, specify the character encoding that the text will be passed on to the voice generator.</seg>
<seg id="2539">& mouth; knows two ways of passing the text. select the check box if the text is to be passed on to the voice generator unchanged as standard input.</seg>
<seg id="2540">If the check box is not selected, the text will be passed as a parameter. you can use the following placeholders:</seg>
<seg id="2541">Of course, the command to voice output depends on your voice generator. you will find this command in the documentation to your language generator. examples are in the appendix.</seg>

<seg id="2543">With the first drop-down selector in the selection of a text passage you determine which action is triggered by the shortcut or by choosing a text passage in the text passbook menu or in the bar for text passbooks.</seg>
<seg id="2544">With the selection of sockets, the chosen text passage will be directly spoken and added to the default memory. with the selection of Add to the input field, the selected text passage will initially be entered only in the input field.</seg>
<seg id="2545">The second selection box Close the edit window for text passbook lets you specify whether the text passbook should be saved automatically when closing the editing window.</seg>
<seg id="2546">The book is saved with the choice of text passbook. if you choose to discard changes, the text passbook will not be saved. select before saving, and & kmouth; ask if the text passbook should be saved.</seg>
<seg id="2547">In the main window next to the input field displays & kmouth; a selection box if this list contains more than one dictionary. with this selection box, you can choose the currently used dictionary for word completion.</seg>
<seg id="2548">With the buttons on the right of the page, you can delete or add dictionaries, change the order of the books or export them to a file. below the list, you can set the name and the language for the dictionary in the input field.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Select the desired language for this source; & kmouth; then read the & kde; documentation. the frequency of each word is simply determined by counting the occurrence. in addition, you can compare the word list with an OpenOffice.org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary.</seg>
<seg id="2550">With this option you can merge the available dictionaries. & kmouth; then asks which dictionaries are brought together and how these should be weighted.</seg>
<seg id="2551">This option lets you create a new, empty dictionary without entries. as & kmouth; newly entered words automatically inserts into the dictionary, you will create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The main area of the window for editing text passbooks is divided into two. in the upper part, the text passbooks are displayed as a tree structure.</seg>
<seg id="2553">In the lower part you can edit a selected entry. if you have selected a text passage, you can change the text passage or the associated keyboard shortcut. if you have selected a text passbook, you can only change its name.</seg>
<seg id="2554">You can either add actions such as new text passages or books, or delete selected text passages and books, either by selecting the menu bar, toolbar or drop-down menu.</seg>
<seg id="2555">The sequence of text passbooks or text passages can be changed by dragging the mouse to the new position or with the arrow keys and the & Alt key.</seg>
<seg id="2556">The selected text is cut out and copied to the clipboard. if a text section is selected in the input field, it is used, otherwise the selected ranges of the processor will be used.</seg>

<seg id="2559">If this menu entry is enabled, a sliding tool bar with buttons is displayed for frequently used commands. by default, the toolbar is located directly under the menu bar via the editing window. by clicking on the hatched left side and dragging, the toolbar can be moved to another position.</seg>
<seg id="2560">If this menu entry is enabled, a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with information about the state of & kmouth; if not checked, this status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="2561">If this menu entry is enabled, a sliding bar for text passbooks is displayed with entries. by default, the bar is located above the editing pane directly below the toolbar. by clicking on the hatched left side and dragging, the toolbar can be moved to another position.</seg>

<seg id="2570">Unfortunately, Hadifax is happy to swallow the last character of the text, so that an additional character needs to be added. therefore, the full command is more complex than in the other examples:</seg>
<seg id="2571">/ usr / local / bin / local / MBROLA / MBROLA / MBROLA / MBROLA / MBROLA / MBROLA / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp / tmp.wav; rm / tmp / tmp.wav</seg>
<seg id="2572">All parts of the command must be written in one line. the option to send data as default must be enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2573">The voice output daemon from & kde; (KTTSD) is a standard interface for voice output. KTTSD is currently being developed in the SVN. it uses modules to support various voice output systems.</seg>
<seg id="2574">Since the voice generator setting only takes place in the KTTSD, you only need to use the Dictsd as a voice service in & kmouth.</seg>
<seg id="2575">To setup, use the KTTSD language service page, which appears in the settings dialog of & kmouth; if KTTSD is installed.</seg>
<seg id="2576">To use & kmouth; you need a voice generator (and of course & kde; 3.x). & kmouth; needs about 15 MB of memory (and additionally memory for the voice generator), but it depends on your computer and its configuration.</seg>

<seg id="2600">Click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current & ktts; system.</seg>
<seg id="2601">Select a tuning type here, there are three male and three female voices as well as a boy and girl's voice to choose from.</seg>
<seg id="2602">When you click here, the new speaker appears on the card board spokesman. to change the settings of this speaker, click Edit.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Now you can go & ktts; almost use it. go back to the tab General and check if voice output is enabled (KTTSD) enabled to allow the TTS service from & kde. see. now you can use & ktts; to make text orders read and manage. see.</seg>
<seg id="2604">If you have at least one speaker, you can start the & kde language sharing system. click the General tab General to open this card. here you can set some general options.</seg>
<seg id="2605">Check this check box to activate the & ktts; system. this starts the KDE-TTS service (KTTSD). if this start succeeds, the card board is displayed and you can create text orders and read. see. remove the mark, will stop KTTSD and the TTS system from & kde; disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2606">If kttsmgr is terminated, proceed & ktts; further, if the field voice output is enabled (KTTSD) is enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2607">If this check box is selected and kttsmgr automatically appears in the control bar while reading, disappears again as soon as the read-out is finished.</seg>
<seg id="2608">With the buttons in this series you can start, cancel, stop and resume text orders.</seg>
<seg id="2609">With the buttons in this series, you can read the current text in the & kde; clipboard or open a text file to read. you can also switch the speaker for a job.</seg>
<seg id="2610">Click Apply or OK, then all changed settings will be applied to all pages.</seg>
<seg id="2611">The card card orders are only displayed when KTTSD started. to start KTTSD, click on the General tab and cross Speech Recover there (KTTSD).</seg>
<seg id="2612">In & konqueror;, the web browser of & kde;, you can read the text of the displayed web page. first check if & ktts; then select the text that should be read, and select Tools Text from the main menu. after a short time the speech should begin.</seg>
<seg id="2613">It is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page. you can skip this step, but then many & HTML; pretension lines and other invisible marks are also read.</seg>
<seg id="2614">In & kate; the extended text editor of & kde;, you can read the displayed text. first check if & ktts; then select the text to be read, and select Tools Text from the main menu. then the speech output should begin.</seg>
<seg id="2615">This also works if & kate; embedded in other applications, such as & eg; in & konqueror; or in & Quanta;.</seg>
<seg id="2616">The Notify is the & kde news system that notifies you of events you have specified. you can also read the text of this message from & ktts; read it.</seg>
<seg id="2617">In & Conversation;, the IRC program of & kde; you can set up & Conversation; for example, set up that you are notified when a message appears in an IRC channel where your nickname occurs. with & ktts; you can then read the IRC message text.</seg>
<seg id="2618">If a Notify is supported, a menu item will appear in the Settings menu of this program. the possible settings for KNotify differ depending on the application.</seg>
<seg id="2619">The file kmail.xml that belongs to the scope of delivery is a good example. it removes the tags br and b from the messages sent by mail, and also the expression / local / inbox since it can be assumed in most cases as presupposed.</seg>
<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced capabilities of fractts; for normal work with & ktops; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In filters, text is processed before being sent to the speech contactor. they are useful for improving pronunciation to replace spoken words or abbreviations, to select a suitable speech and speaker, or to avoid certain shortcomings of speech synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand how filters work, it is important to know how the speech "speech dispatcher" program works with a text. & ktts; distinguishes four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen readers is the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and stops them. if the output of the screen readers is read, the orders received will be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warning has the next priority. this level is important news as & eg; processor gets too hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after issuing the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Messages have the next highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you & eg may read a long text on a website, you can see & kmouth; notifications are also news.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. each order you send from the card card orders is a text order. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text orders. text orders are meant for the output of longer texts which do not have any particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queue, with the exception of the output of screen readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktops; just one reading, this output is stopped and ended.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First, you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter edit the text and pass it to the next filter. currently, there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future, there can be even more types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Text boxes replace parts of a text with other text. the parts to replace can either be specified as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; it is supplied with predefined string translator filters, which enable the creation of chat emoticons such as: -) by text or for reformatting messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better understandable form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; Transformer use an XSLT file (XML; style Language - Transforms) to convert from one format to another format. included in the delivery of & ktts; are some XSLT files for translation of & XHTML; contained in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With language selection filters, you can send orders to a speaker depending on the content of the text or depending on the program sent to & ktts; for example, if you have set a female voice on the board spokesman, you can read the text of KDE messages about it. read more about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these filters has adjustable rules, according to which it is applied to voice output. if the filter states that its rules do not apply, the text remains unchanged to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">When a text order, message, warning or a & kde; notification to & ktts; sent, it is processed by all activated filters that were set up on the page below. processing by the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of the normal filters that have been set up. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and is not used. filters are processed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter, and the following setup dialogs are displayed below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For the setup of character filters you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern. if these patterns are found in the text, then the text is exchanged against the corresponding substitute text. upper and lower case is ignored when compared.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name as you like, it only needs to differ from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column match and replaces it in accordance with the string from the Entry column. the list is processed in the displayed sequence from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. load a list from a file, the entries from the file will be appended to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is entered here, the filter will only apply if the speaker for the text order speaks one of the languages listed here. click the button to display a list of languages. you can also select multiple languages if you hold down the & Ctrl key at the click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter multiple programs separated by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID of running programs is provided with the program qdbus;. the & dbus; numbers you need to omit. if for example & qdbus; the application ID copete-3432 indicates, you may only enter copies.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string release filter is applied to the text only if all the conditions apply with an entry in the box Diesen filter if they match. if all input fields are empty, the filter is applied to all text.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When compared to words, the string release filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\ s. thus, the words must be limited on both sides by delimiters (spaces).</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions. if you have installed the & kde; Editor & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; terms & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; terms & # 160; expressions can be found in the package 'deutils'.</seg>
<seg id="2649">XML; Transformer translate & XML; with the help of XSLT files from one format to another format. XSLT (XML; style Language - Transforms) is a W3C standard for such transformations. however, it can only be applied to well-formed XML. the xsltproc utility program must be installed on your system.</seg>
<seg id="2650">Specify the path for the xsltproc User Language program. if xsltproc can be reached via the PATH environment variable, xsltproc is enough.</seg>
<seg id="2651">With the Speaker Selection filter you can send text to a specific speaker, which is set up on the box speaker, or to a speaker with specific features. for example, you can specify that text should be read by kmail from a female voice. see.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & ktts; a text is passed to the filter, it searches for a speaker for the text. the speaker is selected according to the speaker characteristics that the program presets the text on & ktts; sends, and the characteristics of the speakers set on the card board spokesman. with the Speaker Selection filter you can override the selected speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2653">If a value is entered here, the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression. is on your system the & node; -editor & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; expressions installed, you can call it with a click on the button to get help when entering.</seg>
<seg id="2654">To achieve a faster processing, you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e., start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Specify the properties of the speaker you want. if the text fulfills the filter conditions shown above, the speaker is selected, which best matches the desired requirements. click on the button on the right to see the dialogue box selection.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Use these buttons to save or load your voice settings or delete all settings.</seg>
<seg id="2657">The Speaker Selection Filter is applied to the text only if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Diesen filter when apply. you must enter at least one condition.</seg>
<seg id="2658">The voice-overs API, of & kde; with which programmers can give their applications TTS skills. applications communicate with KTTSD about & dbus;.</seg>
<seg id="2659">The KTTSD Module API, with the voice synthesizer to be added to KTTSD, so & ktts; this synthesizer can use.</seg>
<seg id="2660">The following section contains a short description of the & kde; -DBus; -Interface of the Speech API of & kde;. the complete documentation for both APIs can be found on the cde; Accessibility website (http: / / accessibility.kde.org).</seg>

<seg id="2665">None of the mentioned language synthesizers supports my language. where can I get a synthesizer for my language?</seg>
<seg id="2666">I have set up the & HTML; -XML; converter filter, but web pages are not read when using the module for festival.</seg>
<seg id="2667">Conditionally due to an error in the 1.95 beta festival, you need to install the (male British) voice rab _ diphone for Sable to work at all. you need to do that even if you do not use this voice to read web pages. also make sure that the xsltproc User Language program is installed and can be found using the environment variable PATH.</seg>
<seg id="2668">Certain characters or punctuation marks seem to cause errors in the synthesizer so that whole propositions are skipped or only gibberish. what can I do about it?</seg>
<seg id="2669">First of all, make sure the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language. if there are problems with certain characters or words, they may be corrected by a character set filter. see.</seg>

<seg id="2671">The synthesizers used by & ktts have their own license which you can find in the related documentation or on the related web pages. there are also voices that own a personal license.</seg>
<seg id="2672">If you have access to the KDE source code archive, you can download the package free of charge; download it. & ktts; you can find the source code of kdeFoncftp: / / ftp.kde.org / pub / kde /.</seg>
<seg id="2673">Contains many languages, a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the project page http: / / espeak.sourceforge.net / languages.html.</seg>
<seg id="2674">American English, British, Spanish, German, Finnish, Czech, Polish, Russian, Italian, French, Canadian French, Kiswahili, Zulu and Ibibio.</seg>
<seg id="2675">KTTS works with any voice synthesizer that can be started on the command line in a console.</seg>
<seg id="2676">The list of languages listed above may be incomplete or outdated. therefore, consult the description of the synthesizer to the supported languages. also look at the website of ktts;, for information which is not yet contained in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2677">The 'speech-dispatcher' program uses an adaptable module architecture for speech synthesizers. if you want to expand & ktops; for the use of another synthesizer, contact the developer team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The xsltproc User Language program is used for the support of SSML and for the XML conversion filter, but is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc with the apt-get install xsltproc command.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile and restore, you need a current KDE (version 3.4 or newer) development environment, including the kdelibs packages and the 'speech dispatcher' program.</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have downloaded the source code from & ktts; from the source code archive for decryption or downloaded the tarball currently created each night, compile and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before using & ktts, first check if speech-dispatcher works correctly with your speech synthesizer. you can use the shell script spd-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of dtts; the program kttmsgr is to be developed in such a way that the creation of speech dispatcher is directly possible and the script spd-conf is no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is divided into individual sentences. the user can return punctuation or paragraph, pause, pause or cancel the output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If an application passes text on & ktts, it can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for output. for example, if you have set up a speaker whose language English and its gender is female, this will be used, otherwise automatically the best suitable speaker is chosen. if you want to learn more about how & ktts; select a speaker, look in.</seg>
<seg id="2685">If you click Add to add a speaker to the list or click Edit, the card board will be displayed. as an example, the setup of the module for Festival Interactive will be shown in the following. details on the modules can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path to festival is included in PATH, you only need to enter the festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the character encoding for text that is passed to festival. for voices, which are known, this setting is done automatically. generally, Western languages use ISO 8859-1, Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">With these sliders you set the volume, speaking speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you cannot select some controllers and display them gray, the voice you selected does not allow these settings.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices such as MultiSyn voices need several seconds to be loaded because of their size. if you select this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTSD, so (for larger memory consumption) the first set is synthesized faster.</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you have not yet set up a speaker (or don't forget to click Apply.).</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is selected, the program window is displayed at the start of kttsmgr. otherwise, only the tmgr icon in the system section is visible after the start, but not the program window. click on the icon in the system section to display the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If this check box is selected and kttsmgr still does not run, it appears in the system area as soon as KTTSD reads a text. this gives you the possibility to stop reading or otherwise control it.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Here are all jobs listed in the queue, along with the application that has set the order, the current status of the order, the number of sentences and the currently processed set. the speaker ID corresponds to the ID column on the card board spokesman.</seg>
<seg id="2694">With the buttons in this series, you can go back or forth in the order that is selected in the list below. (but not every order consists of several sentences).</seg>
<seg id="2695">With a click on OK, all changes in the settings (also on the other cards) are taken over and kttsmgr is reduced to the icon in the system section. then click on this icon to display the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2696">If the sound system & arts; not installed, but instead ALSA, GStreamer or aKode, click the Audio tab Audio. see also.</seg>
<seg id="2697">Only text orders are listed and managed here. outputs of screen readers, warnings and messages are not displayed. for more information about the types of news from & ktts, please refer to.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Select the type of audio output here. if a component cannot be selected, & ktts; either compiled without support for the corresponding audio module or fractts; can not load the necessary libraries.</seg>
<seg id="2699">If GStreamer or aCde is to be used for audio output, select the audio output here. if no output modules are displayed in the list, you must install at least one module. if you have selected ALSA, select the PCM device here.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Set the speaking speed here. 501;% equals about half and 200cc;% approximately the double normal speaking speed. to make these settings can be implemented, the program must be sox installed.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Click Apply to take over the new settings for the current & ktts; system.</seg>
<seg id="2702">The list of ALSA devices includes all PCM devices and modules that are set up in your system. most of them will not work. you must find out for yourself which device works with you. in case of doubt, select Standard.</seg>
<seg id="2703">On this card board you can set up special actions which are always executed when the text order is interrupted from a message with higher priority. & ktts; processes four types of speech jobs:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and stops them. after the output of the screen reader is read, the retained jobs are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next highest priority. this level is important news as & eg; processor is reserved too hot. a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Messages have the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that reads messages. if you & eg; just read a long text on a website, you can talk to & kmouth; nevertheless someone who is just entering the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text order is interrupted by a message, warning or the output of a screen reader, adds & ktts; the audio output to the queue.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file is then played when a normal text order is interrupted. if both introductory sound and introductory message are active, the introductory sound will be played before the introductory message.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this card are only valid for normal text orders. there are no special actions for messages, warnings and the output of screen readers if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority.</seg>
<seg id="2710">To read with & ktts; read the Notify messages, start ttmgr and click Notifications. the card alert notifications appear.</seg>
<seg id="2711">Check this check box to enable the read out of & kde. if this setting is not checked, the other settings are disabled and & ktts; do not read alerts.</seg>
<seg id="2712">If this setting is selected, notifications with which a sound is played are not read.</seg>
<seg id="2713">Use these buttons to add or delete events to the list. if you click on the Add button, a dialog appears where you can select the application and event you want to add to the list.</seg>
<seg id="2714">This event will read the message, the & conversation; sent if someone in an IRC message mentions your nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2715">All events for which nothing else is specified in the list are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2716">Use this checkbox to specify what & ktts; to do when an event hits. you have the following choices:</seg>
<seg id="2717">If you have selected custom text, enter the desired text. you can use the following placeholders:</seg>
<seg id="2718">You can enter here the properties of the desired speaker. default selects the speaker, which is shown in the list on the card board spokesman as the top entry.</seg>
<seg id="2719">Note that there are three levels for events. if an action is specified for a specific event of a particular application, the action will be executed. otherwise, the action will be carried out for all other events of the particular application.</seg>
<seg id="2720">The event All notifications for the Application Standard (all other events cannot be deleted from the list. you can specify the notifications as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2721">Use the Save button to save the settings for notifications in a file. use the Load button to load stored settings from a file. the loaded events are merged with the events in the list. if you want to start with an empty list, click Delete. all entries except all notifications are deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to mark text for voice output. this standard contains brands for controlling voices, speaking speed, volume, gender of voice and pitch. also marks for controlling the pronunciation of for example abbreviations. SSML is part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supports & ktts; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following restrictions exist:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You need to install the rab _ diphone voice (British male) since this is the default voice that the festival uses in the output of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival configuration dialog are not set to 100nbsp;%, the SSML text is usually spoken very monotonously.</seg>
<seg id="2726">&lt;! [CDATA [&lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; &lt;! Doctype speakPUBLIC "- / / W3C / / DTD Synthesis 1.0 / / www.w3.org / TR / speech synthesis / synthesis.dtd" &gt; Who slept in my bed? asked the Bärenkind.]] &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and set-limits detection filters (SDB filters). this enables & ktts; this can be quicker with the reading, since only the first set has to be synthesized, not the whole text order. this allows you to skip or stop orders on the card board, even if the voice synthesizer does not directly support this.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the punctuation detection filter. at the first start of & ktts; a set limit detection filter is automatically set up as a default. you can change its settings or add other punctuation detection filters, but beginners will be deprecated.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn the setup of the speaker selection by trying. turn off the speaker selection and select text to read. switch on the speaker selection, change some properties and check how to set up the speaker. of course, you have to set up more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then you can start reading faster, since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block, which can take very long</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can pause or cancel text orders on the card board, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal set limit detection filter is automatically set up if you start ttsmgr for the first time. it can not be switched off, only removed. do not change anything on this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Punctuator recognition filters compare text with a regular expression for propositions and add a tab character (decimal code 8) to the propositional boundaries (tab characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering).</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; messages (knotify), warnings, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal punctuation filter by mistake, you can insert it again by loading the standard _ sbdrc file contained in & ktts.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The box selection box allows you to override the language settings for the application.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the top priority on the card board speaker). in other words: no speaker properties are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use the most appropriate speaker that has all the features of a furnished speaker. if you do not delete or edit the speaker settings, select & ktts; select this speaker. otherwise, select & ktts; the speaker that is most likely to match the originally set properties.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the properties of the subscriber you want. if this property does not play a role, do not enter anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Select this check box if the property should have priority over other properties. you can also set multiple marks here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor when publishing the output, it is always treated as a primary property. you will rarely use this feature. the only case in which you may want to specify the language attribute is above if you know that a particular application text is sent in another language other than the language set in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To delete all the features in the speaker area, which is most likely to delete the following, click on the default speaker, and then use the speaker, which is most likely to follow the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 stands for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify an order number. (without order number the input 0 is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr soon crashes when it is started. I have compiled Debug support, but I do not get any traceability.</seg>
<seg id="2746">For GStreamer 0.8.x, you need to pre-register GStreamer. if the problem is not solved, a non-compatible version of GStreamer is installed. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output over ALSA doesn't work if I play music simultaneously with another application. when I receive a text order, freezes & ktts; a. on the & console; a message that says: unable to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">There is a problem on your system that conflicts occur at ALSA, which prevent simultaneous opening of several PCM devices. you can find hints for possible solutions on the website of the ALSA-project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I loaded an additional voice for festival from the internet. I installed it and can use it in festival, but kttsmgr shows this voice not.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add the new voice in the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / festivalint / Voices. as a guide, you can use the other entries. if this is successful, please send a patch along with the URL; where you have found the voice, to the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In order for this to work, the program must be installed sox and be discoverable via the environment variable PATH. some SynthesizerModule such as Festival Interactive offer even on the card board for speaker installation a setting for speed. depending on the selected voice it is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the speaking speed are ignored if & ktts; & HTML; pre-read. (this is because the HTML is converted to SSML.) Deactivate either the filter for conversion of & HTML; (see) or, if you are quite brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -after-SSML converter filter, and set the speaking speed up.</seg>

<seg id="2768">Before using the synthesizer, first check if your synthesizer works properly. follow the instructions you received with the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS synthesizers, whose source code is obvious. the quality of the voices is generally good, and there are multiple voices and languages supported. with many voices you can adjust volume, speaking speed and pitch with & ktops.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You must install at least one language. help is found in the instructions provided with the festival. if you want to read web pages, you need to install the (male British) voice rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these voices you need to compile an additional module, so you need the source code of the festival. the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This voice requires Festival 1.95 beta or newer. the voice is still in an early stage. unpack the software in festival / lib / vocals / russian /. if you set up the Russian voices, you need to enter the voices MSU _ ru _ NSH _ diphones. choose a Cyrillic (8-bit) encoding, such as koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2773">The festival is usually included in the & Linux distributions. therefore, visit the festival as the first on the CDs of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2774">If you want to use the Polish, Hungarian or Czech languages, the encoding option must be set to ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2775">If you want to use the Russian voice, the encoding option must be set to a 8-bit Cyrillic like koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2776">Festival can be used together with the MBROLA; synthesizer. then Festival takes on lexical analysis and & MBROLA; it generates the audio output. the & MBROLA; program and the & MBROLA; voices can be downloaded from</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetwork.conf, a module for the & kcontrolcenter, allowing management of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a unified, integrated interface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter.</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package was designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & kcontrolcenter; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings are displayed at & kcontrolcenter; the network settings module (knetwork.conf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network Network settings in & KMenu;</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkd.conf is not able to install. physical devices and their drivers need to be installed and configured in a functional way, so that & knetworkconf; the device at all shows and allows setting of the network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for the network hardware and other devices are installed and set up. if network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The network settings module is loaded when the option Network settings is selected in the & kcontrolcenter; -Index. when the module's network settings are started, this attempts to automatically detect the platform used on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be detected, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to choose which best matches the distribution and the level of release. by selecting the setting non-again questions, the definition can be made permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode. previously, all options are gray, meaning the settings can only be viewed, changing is not possible. in the system management mode, you can access the system management mode at the right bottom of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">The entire functionality of the module is available in the system management mode. it is divided into three tabs:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The Rider network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be carried out by the Rider network interfaces:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button interface... to be edited in the Device Dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the Advanced Settings button to open the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the option Automatically select TCP / IP settings from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings for the system will also be done with the start of system services. the DHCP or BOOTP server will send all necessary TCP / IP information at each system startup, so no further setting is required. in the selective list, either DHCP or BOOTP can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">The manual can be selected without dhcp or BOOTP the TCP / IP configuration. in the IP address input field, the desired TCP / IP address must be specified. in the netmask input field, the subnet mask must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface when booting. if the initialization is unwelcome, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. ping in the & console; you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in case of doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or turned off as needed. switching on a switched network device is enabled by selecting from the list and clicking on Interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or turned off as needed. switching off an activated network device can be deactivated by selecting from the list and clicking on Interface....</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the host's IP address in the local subnet that communicates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with hosts in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the computer calls http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS will resolve this name into an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution calculator part of the tabs name resolution allows easy administration of this list. entries can be added, removed or altered. DNS records can be sorted by selecting an entry and listing or downgrading in the list with the Hindu or Heron buttons in the priority list.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button Add... from the group calculator to the name resolution, a DNS server can be added. it will be added to the New Name Server dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry will then be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group calculator to name resolution, select an entry and then click the Edit button.... It will display the Edit dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list of names known by name specifies hostname-to-IP address links for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is primarily used when booting when there are no DNS servers available. in small, remote networks, it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Typically, the list includes some known hosts some entries, the & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses. this still in the test version of IP will replace version 4 in the future.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known host and click Add.... The New Alias dialog will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the known host and click the Add button. if the familiar host has multiple alias names, de button Add multiple times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry from a name known by name from the list and select Edit.... The Modified Computer dialog will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be executed one of the following tasks, then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the Network settings module are not effective immediately in the system. in order to activate the changes, you need to set the following command.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The home page of & knetworkd.conf is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (mostly rpm packages), if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the ready-compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool with a graphical interface such as kpackage or the installation tool of your distribution can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; not, but additionally the development packages are needed with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended for experienced users only. however, it is not difficult to compile and compile. the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology is given, and in the second section all of & knetworks.conf may be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace advanced knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information about the integration of the PC is mediated into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently being operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv6 has never found great dissemination. IPv6 is expected to be implemented in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface. in foreign networks, at & eg; Workplace, the network administrator is the point of contact which is valid for a valid IP address or if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address cannot be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up an own small (home) network, the IP address should be chosen from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, therefore their arbitrary use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be made possible by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks usually addresses in the area of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = your own computer).</seg>
<seg id="2847">The net address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in your local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to your own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circuit.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part are the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkd.conf and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed in DSL connections, so it won't be surprised if another content is found there in the case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is randomly sorted by the scripts in SuSE. another level than expected may therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar, which also offered the ability of dds2tar for fast, selective packing. the second goal was to answer a question my wife asked: how much longer does it take if you secure?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used it must be engaged in & dat; it can happen in three ways:</seg>

<seg id="2896">Recognizes & kdat; the preload, searches for the appropriate index on your disk. if it cannot be found, you will be asked if the tape index needs to be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">When everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was integrated. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the volume of the tape can now be searched by folding the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Prior to ejecting the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>

<seg id="2915">Before initiating the restore, the files you want to restore must be selected. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in any of the archives belonging to the tape drive. it will only restore the selected file or subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore from the File menu....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the restore process has been started, the dialog will appear for recovery. in this dialog, you can once again check your selection and change the work folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the restore settings, the dialog will appear. this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it is necessary to re-create the index file by means of the band content. this process will delete all existing index files for this tape. you can create the index in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can set the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder where the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders listed under backup files, only the files located in the same file system are backed up as folders. folders located on other filesystems can be entered separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar independently from the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Delete the snapshot file before calling tar. this will cause all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file will be created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">& gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt;</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set up the settings via the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding version of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Is this setting active, transmitted & dat; before the tape is mounted the command mt load to the drive. in some drives, this is necessary before read or write operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is enabled, try & kdat; to lock the ejection at the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is enabled, the tag is automatically discarded when it is deleted. do not use this option for floppy embedding.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is enabled, try & kdat; not all drives support variable block sizes. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you must notify & kdat; in any case the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a tape is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only occupy one block of memory on the tape. the content of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band ID. the format of this string is hostname: seconds, with the hostname being the full name of the system on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the period in which the tape was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The rest of the files on the tape are tar archives, which can be administrated directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup tape. this symbol is only active when a tape is mounted.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; Viewer for System Logs. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system leaves the different protocol files. in addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users allow quick access to, for example, information about problems appearing on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the log files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system leaves the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; hence attempts to provide some advanced functions with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">The current version 0.4.1 has & kesystem log; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other features are also included and will be explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the screenshot below, we provide & ksystemlog; functions with which the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can be easily filtered and sorted. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After startup, & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - is not displayed, and it opens instead of a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; very likely not started with system administrator rights. the protocol files are usually found under Linux in / var / log, for the normal user usually do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criterion or entered string. add a string to the filter bar. in the default setting, the selection box next to the filter will display the Show All. then a record line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is contained in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can of course select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term is then matched only with the entries in the selected column. for example, in the protocol file, select the process column, and then enter the name of a process in the filter bar, and then show & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to see the important protocol lines. protocol lines of the level error are displayed with a more conspicuous color as protocol-lines of the level indicator. the colored representation of log lines can be switched to setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you only want to display a specific process (for example in the system protocol or in the Cron protocol), you can use the process identification (PID) in the process column. for example, this can be useful if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the Samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can activate the Add to new lines in the main window context menu to display all new incoming log lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows you to display multiple log files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage extra windows. as soon as you have selected a subwindow, select a log from the menu to view.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website to http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Dort you will find more current information about the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; you can also find in the following folder of the & node; -Subversion archives: ksystemlog; in & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to the & kde; System V Init Editor, more known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The System V Init quickly becomes the standard for controlling the program start-up in the Linux & Linux system; this is because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD ini.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further into historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know anything about myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary is below / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and reformatting. the & Linux kernel looks first under / etc after an init file. therefore, you need to make sure that the old init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically you need a script for every system service that you want to run when you boot the system or when you switch to another running level. system services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which is started only once. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be in / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is actually not much use for it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks for init at different places and starts the first it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default running level is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look into the second column and probably notice that the default running level 3 is. if you want to change this, then you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have messed up something, then you can fix it by rebooting the system and executing the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no right files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument such as start and stop. you can actually start these scripts manually from the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the K contains, the script is called stop with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be called with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; have a server runtime running only httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc; I could also have a user running level, & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is easy, not to say trivial: simply drag an entry from the area of the available system services to one of the six Runtime to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between running leveling or change the position within a level by dragging it somewhere else. this will only take place from its original running level (or position). this will only happen if you extract an entry from the area of the available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries will be moved if you drag them to a new area. to simply copy them to a new Runtime, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste them into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorbet number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries that have been thrown into the Recycle Bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to activate the different working areas (available system services, Runtime 1 Start, Runtime 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another run level, move it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and paste it into the desired run-level with pasting (using Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the input key to switch the Properties dialog. use the Tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of loss of data, all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. pre-settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they will be restored by & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I experimented with the standard runtime and now the machine is constantly restarted. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt linux single and press the input key to start in single-user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default running level to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; for execution under running level X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use SuSE; or Delix (DLD) then you will need to edit additional files in / etc which are only present in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions simplifies the configuration for the proprietary installation programs of these distributions but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution, please check if all configuration files are available that are required by the respective system service (and whether they are in the proper directory). some services (such as & eg, Apache or httpd) simply end without notice if their configuration files are not present or incorrectly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; running level varies from distribution to distribution, even from version to version. if you are using another distribution, please send me information about the runtime, so that you can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To begin with & kuser; it is sufficient to read Chapter Adjustment of & kuser;</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you made changes, you need to save it. either use the toolbar icon or the Save in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">The main window consists of two flashcards, the user group and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry. it appears the dialog for user and group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some cards are only displayed when you have advanced system settings. only when you have enabled user space restrictions (quota) for users is created a card board where you can make individual settings. additional cards may appear, if shadow passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card password management board appears if shadow passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card only appears if space limitation (quota) is activated and initialized for at least one embedded file system (recognizable by the quota user / quota group file on the file system).</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each filesystem. the current file system is selected with space limitation using the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The groups that belong to the user can be found in the Primary Group field. furthermore, the user can become a member of other groups by marking them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The Properties dialog of the group contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the User or Group menu or click the matching Add button on the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or group works analog.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can install the LILO boot manager, add, remove and change the boot password, add the time to the booting of the standard operating system, add, remove, change, change operating systems, remove, change, and more.</seg>
