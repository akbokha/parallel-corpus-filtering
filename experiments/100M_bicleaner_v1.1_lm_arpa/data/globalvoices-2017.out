although I had visited the US since 2012 at least once a year , I would live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordinarily great .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , dancing to American music , reading American authors and practi@@ sing their sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can L@@ etter , a fear@@ less repor@@ ter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil @-@ mag@@ n@@ ate , who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were interested in his interest .
I was trapped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was like the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona had only increased my admir@@ ation for the United States .
I always said , &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even had a very fan@@ ati@@ cal love letter written about his great@@ ness .
then came Donald Tr@@ ump .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
with his opinion , he never stops behind the mountain , as one says so beautifully .
he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague , and publicly den@@ ies his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , African Americans and women .
nevertheless people have responded to his statements and voted in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can prim@@ aries was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever reached .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ?
I could not reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism programme that welcomes people from all over the world , a deeply dev@@ out person with whom I was able to talk about Islam and his past .
neither was Tr@@ um@@ ps world@@ view coinci@@ ded with that of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ad@@ a and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; playing in the game .
Tr@@ um@@ ps Int@@ oler@@ ance is also in stark contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fights the environment for a long time , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
she still fits the engagement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew delicacies , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot during my career .
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump posted his way to the nom@@ in@@ ee Republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America .
it turned out , however , that they were the exception of the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly White , gave the pres@@ idency to a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t towards non @-@ white people .
the debate with the idea that people voted for tr@@ ump because they either shared their rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps it is unfair to design@@ ate the Tr@@ ump @-@ voters as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ra@@ cists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to classi@@ fy people , one of my friends said , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is super@@ ficial and respect@@ ful and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , most of whom are white , voted for tr@@ ump because they want to reg@@ ain control of a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , would they perhaps say that they are still important in this America ?
perhaps .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comment@@ ates on the cruel decision to lift up a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t upon those who look different from him .
this &quot; whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( note of the O@@ B . ) : &quot; revol@@ ving the wh@@ ites against all other ethnic groups . &quot; the white and whi@@ plas@@ h play , as the Great Van Jones , has just killed what America has made so great .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background one likes , America is everyone welcome .
for this country chose as its president twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ an@@ ite , its history , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
with the election of Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , a huge portion of the white American gives this promise and says : to hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say .
all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of word with the crowd .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd shou@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they shou@@ ted and their voices became lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone who is not like you , would have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan closed with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , this is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the country for which his son was pleased sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ um@@ ps Land , the message said .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan could find no place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

from misery to stars : these Latin American children do not let their love of music spoil by rub@@ b@@ ish
the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .
image of Fli@@ ck@@ r user OE@@ A @-@ O@@ AS ( CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 ) .
what does the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca have in common with the children of the Paragu@@ a@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
that the music played in both places has not only changed the lives of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city that is very popular with tourists -@@ but worlds apart from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for several years now , the La b@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults who has found a way to overcome poverty through their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and gangs violence .
but this changed after a chance meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare gli@@ mmer of hope .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press No@@ tici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they get out of school they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
you always come laugh@@ ing and playing with shiny eyes and play in the hu@@ stle you learn to play trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , o@@ bo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pani , bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from tr@@ ash
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometers south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village located on top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paragu@@ ay@@ an capital - play on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ conditioned instruments made of local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez have begun to transform parts of waste into instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate fi@@ ddle , viol@@ a , cel@@ los , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums , all of which were made out of the tr@@ ash .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article by the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and musician of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , rec@@ alls at the beginning :
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the tr@@ ash . the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something he had never seen before : a violin made from waste .
today , there is a whole orchestra playing on instruments made of recycled material and that is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentation named &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance :
every year , the world generates approximately one billion tons of tr@@ ash .
those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically tells about international , practical solutions for environmental problems .
re@@ publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the sharing of content .
in West Africa it was known then that this ship had already had illegal fishing in Liberia &apos;s waters before it sought the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were raised accordingly and little inclined to welcome a law break@@ er of this kind on their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Moz@@ ambique and the Seych@@ elles quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to b@@ link one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused to &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; re@@ members Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , an executive employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team who discovered and persecuted the ship at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : he didn &apos;t manage to catch fish there .
ultimately , it was also forced to pay $ 2 million in Liberia , as a result of lo@@ oting the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 founded by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal F@@ ish@@ eries ) .
the members of this network are besides Somalia and Madagascar the six countries that the prime ministers had driven out of their waters back then .
they exchange information and help each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project provides technical support for F@@ ISH @-@ i .
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to track down . therefore illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
by the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws through which certain habitats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems which have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also through the sn@@ ail @-@ emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , these actions happen nowadays in real time , trac@@ eable to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about suspi@@ cious activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i is also very attentive to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea by satellite data .
this allows the authorities to flag ships which are fishing in forbidden areas . such suspi@@ cious routes can also be discovered , such as those indic@@ ative that a ship charges its caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such investigations can show whether the vessels involved have a fishing license , where they were on the move and , if possible , whether they have a criminal law .
countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such vessels in their ports on the basis of this information , meaning that ships cannot sell their cargo , and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there are substantial financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worth financial support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , managing director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm campaig@@ ning for the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the previously mentioned platform was created to recover an estimated $ 20 million lost in revenue lost by the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network each year because of illegal fishermen entering into East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries , so the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world . among them also illegal fishermen .
among them are actions including sailing under false flag , counter@@ f@@ eit licensed papers , specification of fantasy names , fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non @-@ complete control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship was able to fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You may not run my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole is trying to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the closed front has so far been working .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspi@@ cious ships .
it has revealed criminal networks that had spread fal@@ si@@ fied licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used multiple frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has persecuted and found fle@@ eting ships .
due to its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authorities for the fight against crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to locate suspect vessels more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evolving , also helps to track down the illegal vessels that love to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very ingeni@@ ous techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO that also deals with fish@@ eries data and provides technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
Cop@@ eland is therefore helping build a system that connects different levels of information . it is intended to help F@@ ISH @-@ i find criminal acts with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has jointly opened the platform Global Fishing Watch together with Google and the Oce@@ ana marine conservation organization : a platform that provides satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by means of the position of each track@@ able ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbours to get a better picture of who does what where - that makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and join their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ew char@@ itable tru@@ sts have a similar project to allow a global system to prosec@@ ute ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are indications that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals but also deter them .
ships which had previously been fishing without a license and had little to reck@@ on with consequences now know that they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i are now seeing a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries sales since fishing boats are buying more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i had helped Somalia detect Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors were there on board tra@@ w@@ l nets , whose use is prohibited .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars annually disappear by illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 , six countries joined forces , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they too are fighting illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; Safety is the goal of developing even more of such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country Somalia was able to report its first big triumph : in October , it represented Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship sailing under a false flag . and not only was the ship on the move without a license and were used tow@@ ing nets that are now banned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also im@@ bu@@ ed into forbidden waters reserved for Fischer from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such a special collaborative approach to protecting the oceans really works across the world sea .

their articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to escal@@ ate : demonstrations in several cities with the goal of &quot; rec@@ laim@@ ing the country &quot;
the movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered to protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the removal of President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

after the Venezu@@ el@@ an government rejected the opposition &apos;s request to a referendum on the term of office , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into empt@@ iness , re@@ acted in the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : Venezuela &apos;s ref@@ unding ) both these demonstrations and arguments can be found for and against them .
the debate will also be held in other parts of the country - among others in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ de@@ an regions of MÃ©@@ ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a , in the centrally located federal Parliament Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the country &apos;s political and economic situation is wor@@ sen@@ ing continuously , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition saw the chance for a fundamental change in the im@@ pe@@ achment of the current President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro , but ultimately the reluc@@ tance of a new election was blocked by official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , Con@@ tri@@ but@@ ors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises in her latest article the context of the governmental decision as follows :
in the context of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the rate of inflation and violence is one of the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % at the end of the year ) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine exists , the referendum was regarded as the only way to give the country a chance to reg@@ ain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democ@@ r@@ Ã¡@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Unit ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined forces , urged the demonstr@@ ators to join a mass rally to support the National Assembly , which after the elections of 2015 was planned for the majority of representatives of the opposition .
the call was commented on Twitter as follows :
it is so far Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil strike and on November 3 all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores palace .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the first demonstration in the programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday 26 October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pictures of the mar@@ ches , which are published in real time , testify among other things an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also disputes with polic@@ emen and supporters of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most frequently shared pictures shows a demonstr@@ ator calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this Venezu@@ el@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter , images that talk about arguments , as well as reports of oppression and mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , are pil@@ ing up on Twitter .
particularly large waves hit the news of police repression in the centrally located town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves according to their own statements in front of the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an state T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a don &apos;t wear skir@@ ts , because otherwise you could see something that many National Gu@@ ards do not have !
meanwhile , an inf@@ ographic already accounts for the amount of suppression per day :
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the demand for an im@@ pe@@ achment procedure - it was now proved in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .
the My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s :
Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of signatures are counter@@ f@@ eit .
here is your Rev@@ e@@ tion !
on the road !
others are evaluating these protests as a further step in the fight against a government that has taken little against the disa@@ strous economic crisis and has rather occupied themselves with making critical voices sil@@ enced :
they took us so much - but also the fear !
mar@@ ches are increasing in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans told the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or going shopping .

the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to take a look at the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine city of CÃ³r@@ doba .
as a grown @-@ up man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now testified against his father as part of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial in the province of Cor@@ doba .
the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , investig@@ ates crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
he started to wear the same name as his father until the brutal military operations in the La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , suffered enough .
for 34 years , he kept the family secret for himself .
in the situation at that time , I believed that was fine .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child of 15 years , one does not realize that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time , I couldn &apos;t realize that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ turer and killer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a gendar@@ mer@@ ie . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was the deputy commander of the Secret Service Department 141 in prison La Per@@ la from 1976 to 1978 .

no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who , over the years , realized the extent of the atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy , and who testified before a federal court against his own father .
his story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose for himself a way of redemption .

when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts .
all called it &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and invited me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have been friends with one of the ERP .
be careful not to kidn@@ ap you one day and then I &apos;ll have to save you .
the ac@@ ron@@ ym ERP is for Ej@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party of Argentina .
that is why he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work at the military base .
he told me I would become a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for so my father had educated me .
at the base of the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ Over there the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me a total of four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to get off . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just anything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small pack@@ et wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big lum@@ ps of silver inside .
on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks where the stolen objects were par@@ ked and stopped me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured there .
I saw in , and saw a couch in which men were tor@@ tured .
she looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they fastened it to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was lying there .
they seldom caught a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , poured it on him with water and hun@@ ted him with a charge of 220 volts to the gen@@ itals .

the smell there was horri@@ ble ... like a dirty di@@ aper .
years later when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I recognized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it possible that a man can hurt another so much suffering ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ i knew these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were wearing eyes .
he spoke with &quot; Chu@@ bi &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian who was also accused in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a series of matt@@ resses on which naked people lay down with the face down - all were tied to hands and feet .
near the entrance , people kept quiet on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father saw that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you bring me otherwise ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , there were some rooms designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero bowed and killed a man there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to the survivors , the Zi@@ vi@@ list Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused of the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial , was sentenced to death by the student Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , director of the La Per@@ la Memorial Site , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came in here is also the way on which the kidn@@ apped came here .
look at the map , see that they took about this route and then tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order came from above that they should be reloc@@ ated .
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of human beings and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; spo@@ ils &apos;
my father brought home all kinds of stolen items .
at that time at the age I had no idea what the &quot; war boot@@ y &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was in the military later , - I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war boot@@ y is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military signs that are taken from an enemy that has been fought .

but if one goes to a house and ste@@ als the refrigerator , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... then this is not a spo@@ ils of war but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wonder@@ ed how my father , the leader of the security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have fallen into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You who steal cars on the streets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded with anger , struck me and cried :
if you go so far , I &apos;ll find you and kill yourself .
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do that !
this is how my father was .
I don &apos;t have a single good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of that time , on which I wore a jacket and a pul@@ lover pul@@ lover from wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we weren &apos;t poor , but he still brought clothes back home .
at that time , the Defense accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator with this crime . I replied , no problem ; they can burden me what they wanted .
I was there anyway to say .
&apos;@@ En@@ forced dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ p@@ se is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &apos;
now that I get older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once you have children , you realize the value of a life .
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , so you were exec@@ uting people during the dictatorship , but what did the cor@@ p@@ ses leave for ?
why do children kidn@@ ap ?
one day my father brought a girl home whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I repeatedly asked the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could have put them in jail .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why would their bodies disappear ?
did these people not also had families to whom one could pass their mortal remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ p@@ se is the last abom@@ in@@ able act one can do to a human being .
my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they fet@@ ched machines to remove the mortal remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were grin@@ ded and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you &apos;ll never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but , of course , something remains .
&apos;@@ i have seen you killed humans ! &apos;
only to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father .
the idea of showing my father was created during a conversation when he was placed under house arrest .
I made him repro@@ aches because of all the atro@@ cities I had to experience because of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt in@@ war@@ dly disgu@@ sted and asked me why the whole exagger@@ ated patrio@@ tism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; they allegedly defended were really good .
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something ?
I saw you killed humans !
you have committed terrible crimes and you forced me as a child to take part in it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , then forgive me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I watched the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can blame me for being bi@@ ased . I finally said against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest pending the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes : including severe , illegal de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 particularly serious cases , torture followed by death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years old .

the sentences in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 with a crime against 7@@ 16 victims in August .
43 Supp@@ liers were found guilty of crimes against humanity and sentenced in 28 cases to imprisonment and in nine cases prison sentences ranging between 2 and 14 years . in six cases , there were acqu@@ itt@@ al claims .
eleven of the original 54 def@@ end@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ enge : murder , torture and rape by officials . # Es@@ war@@ State terrorism
all the def@@ end@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police personnel and civilian employees .
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant wife in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the chamber of silence :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
the Court of Jud@@ gment is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on justice for the victims .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ inian organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , representing the children of people who were murdered during the dictatorship or disappeared , said :
the trial lasted more than three years , but the research took 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that a memorial could be built there , which is now being run by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes older people in Kyoto a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a center in Kyoto , where you can extend your driver &apos;s license .
the photo was circul@@ ated in the social media .
adaptation of the original photographs by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center where one can pro@@ long its driving licence , last month witnessed a particularly mis@@ guided translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a sign the Japanese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means wrong@@ ly - maybe also with malicious h@@ ul@@ ls &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was from 1 to 20 September on electronic displays in the entrance area and in the building itself .
review Joshua Lev@@ ine &apos;s original photos , which has been widely shared in the social media .
the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the Kyoto @-@ based daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to older people and in an international city as Kyoto is simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the flaw@@ ed English translation was first removed . the term &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; ) was later replaced by the more appropriate , although gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct name &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the police of Pre@@ f@@ ecture Kyoto ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the mistake was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger told us about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sincer@@ ely sorry that older people felt insul@@ ted by inadequate correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News dealt with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; elderly drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of elderly drivers involved in accidents is quite a matter of concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , in 2005 1,@@ 9@@ 41 were caused by a total of 19,@@ 460 deaths of sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors caused 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
this increased their share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has increased over the same period .
the un@@ named repor@@ ter brought comments to the light in the version of the article published on Yahoo , which show which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently he@@ ap against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo over the translation error has , among other things , received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this not reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So the translation is not true , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that this is a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
to translate , one needs two important skills : passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and to provide active language skills in order to transmit it to the target language .
the latter requires an active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction is that translators in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ English as their native language to make translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons , or the relatively small number of English native speakers learning Japanese .
however , some companies that do not have foreign employees can still make translations in @-@ house . then the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is considered to be the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results .
the wor@@ sen@@ ing and pu@@ zz@@ ling phrases , which arise through machine translation , show that this technique cannot substitute a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints that often ad@@ orn T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or even understood .

translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery , but by large corporations or by government that have the means to ensure higher standards , one can expect more meticul@@ ous translations .
in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully make use of a more serious source of its translations .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the Internet and on TV
main page of the &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; portal ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users announced that they would have no access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the internet presentations of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible .
other online broad@@ cast@@ ers also carried out recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organized by opposition groups opposed to the government Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros .
protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dis@@ b@@ anded the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and writer at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ te . he pointed out that the connection was caught and recommended the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# C@@ ens@@ orship : enables your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers have been blocked again .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media has been hes@@ it@@ ant in reporting on protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission was threatening to punish them with fin@@ es and closures if they would continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as an &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national television channels , I registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again .
it is amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lem@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO , VE@@ Sin@@ in@@ tro confirmed later that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the domain name system ( DNS ) , but also two more online transm@@ it@@ ters . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly takes its sessions .
earlier investigations of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS servers respond accurately to certain domains .
if a Web site is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds in@@ correctly or den@@ ies the request when calling such a website .
we confirm a DNS block : @ el@@ ed@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
on V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the transmission was stopped on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was arrested .
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went to broadcast again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections , making it more and more difficult for Venezu@@ el@@ an access to multimedia reporting on current events in the country .
in Paraguay a lot of girls become slaves to get an education
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today T@@ ina is fighting for the rights of children and collecting testim@@ onies from other Cri@@ adi@@ tas , who have been victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying C@@ ows , falling schools &quot; ) edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride in her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one from which something has become , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she became ten years old , she began to work as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ tas , in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money transfers their under@@ age son or their under@@ age daughter to another , more rich family . in exchange , the child receives food , training and a roof above the head .
what is not mentioned , however , is that the children have to pay a number of days of house@@ work , which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be aboli@@ shed .
this practice called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to name things by name , because the feeling of gratitude in@@ oc@@ ulated to the Cri@@ adi@@ ta in general guarantees still silence .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , there is the family that her daughter finds in believing that she can complete her training , improve her position in society and &quot; make something out of herself &quot; to another family .
on the other hand , the family that receives the girl with her and justi@@ fies its exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and perhaps even star@@ ved .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is ab@@ used , his family will learn about it only many years later .
sometimes they never know about it .
in January 2016 , the so far unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the hidden in Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n arrived in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed signs of violent impacts . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was in the household of the former military associate , Tom@@ Ã¡s F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o , who works as a civil servant at the Population Register .
Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small village with only 3.000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
end of January 2016 F@@ errei@@ ra entered Mar@@ Ã­n as long as she suffered le@@ thal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deeply rooted practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go responsible for the death of the girl in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozens of people came together to protest mar@@ ches and demanded that there be &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered than children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compl@@ ained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
without papers it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children un@@ punished .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbors of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a prompt investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be tr@@ end@@ setting - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as labour , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Job@@ bik party , in which her father worked , had to en@@ roll in bank@@ rupt@@ cy and her father lost his work .
their brothers now had to work and began to sell sweets on the street or on the market to earn money .
but they all went further to school .
only T@@ ina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n as Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked in the home of her employer between four and six hours every day .
she had to divide the time in such a way that she still had time to learn .
she got up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employers .
on Fri@@ days , for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went back home and had time to learn .
the more she was finished with learning , the more free time she had .
but also this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but also didn &apos;t have unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge , &quot; she rec@@ alls .
the library was well @-@ equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who belonged to the opposition during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power between 1954 and 1989 .
on some evenings the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand beside him and read Edi@@ tori@@ als from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to convince them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
he kept them intelligent , but did not stay with her . &quot; the host had found someone who listened while he talked about politics , &quot; she says .
&quot; they often didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family because they were of the opinion that I would learn &quot; bad habits &quot; there again . &quot; this meant that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the indigenous group of the Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ , would speak at home again her mother tongue Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ .
their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made possible for them .
however , she was fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them with their hard work .

society appro@@ ves Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , where you can share job ads for cleaning personnel and nur@@ ses in Paraguay .
the group administration is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or in the district of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please report to us .
starting from Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad got five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; likes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the place Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a eleven year old girl and gave her telephone number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman , who also came from Ã@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the third comment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the interior that wants to work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was written . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the editor once more switched on :
dear friends , I have found one . I &apos;ll see if it works with it .
thank you very much , I write again when something is .
the business was completed .

bill dra@@ fts Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
image of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , altered by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians have recently agreed to draft a bill on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the regulations on the use and use of social networks &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when adopted by Parliament , users of social media in Egypt must register with a government agency in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a job would be set up that is mand@@ ated to grant citizens permission to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months of acceptance of the law , users must register on the site with their correct names and identity card numbers in order to be able to use social networks .
if this fails to do so , it could have a sentence of up to six months in jail or a fine .
the bill comprising six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ ses in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent defines social media as &quot; any application that runs and is used across the Internet to communicate with others by means of voice , video surveillance and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law is en@@ forced when it is accepted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities are supposed to impose the registration . unclear is also how they should make up those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to guarantee regulation at the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , MP and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a username and password from the telecommunications ministry to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt is planning to build a fire@@ wall at national level around Facebook . it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network .
but it has not been known until now that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; leading research technologi@@ sts &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I strongly dispute the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things related to technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that as they viol@@ ently control physical public and private spaces it could be done online .
if I take them seriously , it means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who apply or not . and that is a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them into a judicial process .
this is by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed under the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it goes to the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft is in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control will be maxim@@ ized and ensured that no different nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime in which a life sentence imposed on those who were found guilty of &quot; threatening public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;

this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was published in the original on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions . the article is published here as part of an agreement on content sharing .
high up in the mountains of the Kur@@ dist@@ an Region in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal prot@@ ector H@@ ana Ah@@ med R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ards .
a sub@@ type of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , who w@@ ander through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether there are between 800 and 1.000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered due to po@@ aching , loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they find less and less loo@@ t .
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
as R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem depends also on the fact that a big pre@@ dat@@ or is present .
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard indeed in the wild is low and goes against zero . when the team in the video determines that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera , R@@ aza breaks out in pure joy .
as a bi@@ ologist , R@@ aza passion@@ ately shows a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and in the educational programmes of Nature Iraq for six years .
since 2013 , she has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is committed to providing protection zones for wildlife in the Kur@@ dist@@ an region .

in early March 2017 , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , responsible for North East Japan , documented the progress achieved over the past six years to re@@ build the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; in March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atomic accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma caused the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture was an et@@ ectable pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring coun@@ ties Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to ev@@ acu@@ ate , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had left whole coastal cities disappear from the map .
in addition to that , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture experienced a nuclear accident , already because of that , 16@@ 0,000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows , from a local point of view , what progress was achieved six years later in order to re@@ build the lives of the local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese reconstruction and survey results of those concerned themselves .
the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that by December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement buildings were completed ( for example , in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate ) in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to record the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , where 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma holds the final light at 70 percent .
nevertheless , even six years after the catastrophe , one stri@@ ves to reloc@@ ate ev@@ ac@@ uation of temporary shel@@ ters ( for example , to cas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) into final replacement houses .
after the triple disaster , nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in temporary shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate still lived in such dwell@@ ings .
almost 40 percent of the vill@@ agers from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma were still living in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful in this area . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation , which came after the disaster in temporary homes , was res@@ ett@@ led into final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate the number here is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , affected by mis@@ fortune , opened their doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures schools .
six years later , industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while nearly 100 per cent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are in operation again , only 30 percent of fish@@ eries have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident have affected agricultural land extensively in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , where only 66 per cent of the farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 per cent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma can be re@@ used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of land destroyed by Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are located in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nuclear barrier zone &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far off .
the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 per cent on the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only show 75 percent here .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal dw@@ ellers , it is more difficult to earn their living .
is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to establish a general picture , the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the ev@@ acu@@ ates . she asked her about the state of reconstruction and also how her feeling was changed over the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in its introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents took measures to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents found that still not enough in terms of cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es prevention was done .
what it means to those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its edition on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the Ev@@ acu@@ ates from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had not only witnessed the tremendous earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also witness to the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed .
of 16@@ 0,000 Ev@@ acu@@ ates from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , were res@@ ett@@ led in permanent replacement houses .
according to the State of 2017 , there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside of their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation centers in the disaster areas are older than 50 years old . it is well known that the efforts to re@@ build Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma will have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when you meet people from other countries who speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , one often recognizes that one more connects than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important , as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our prospects and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
as a result of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , let &apos;s take a look at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast , we treat issues that often attract less attention when reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members , who remember a moment when they have felt very strongly connected with someone beyond language and country borders .
Ver@@ oni@@ ka Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how a hike has consolidated its affection for Iranian culture ; Viol@@ eta Cam@@ ar@@ asa speaks about the time when she worked with people from all over the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he gathered in a small village in Madagascar .

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer had beaten him up against his head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia . millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march nationwide .
Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated on him this Saturday and transferred him to an artificial coma .
his condition is regarded as critical .
the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , spreading rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer attacked with a bat@@ on . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police announced in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the investigation of the incident from the active service .
the pictures show the police officers as he hits the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and ended up in the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the whole repression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , distributed the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z in the net in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs briefly rush towards him .
another video with the same scenes , filmed from a different perspective , is also reflected in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have meanwhile donated 10.000 Brazilian Re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia while lying in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; against police violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the drawing was divided multiple times into social networks .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado retri@@ eves further attacks against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s :
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s is experiencing a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was murdered by his father , because he was fighting the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . and now we have a very sad case of Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who is on the intensive care unit after being attacked by a polic@@ eman who has struck him with a bat@@ on .
police Sur@@ vi@@ vors
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil where brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators took place last Friday .
police officers put on protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators built a stage for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
the member of Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to ren@@ ounce violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de SÃ£o Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , the Brazilian media have covered street protests by turning the focus on another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane .
the following ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo were specifically reporting about a broken glass window to design their front pages illustr@@ atively with a photo .
on the other hand , O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus on fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window pane than about the protests of thousands of thousands of people serving the defense of a special cause .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly against any form of property damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; again , the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acqu@@ ires an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violence of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation with the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Un@@ spo@@ ilt villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso nearly hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba closed doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , who is located in the Western Cu@@ ban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is commonly known as el Central - at Spanish sugar mill - no not@@ withstanding that there is no significant sugar harvesting on site .
it is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ sed .
after succ@@ eeding , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ ig@@ ned and comm@@ uted daily to the factories still grinding .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an who is open every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region that are in operation again after a long in@@ active period because they have been preserved .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene rec@@ alls exactly that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry has already with@@ stood the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad administration decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 .
the message would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no longer a news anymore .
why was the Cu@@ ban sugar cane industry off ?
the old platform of the community saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane mills were technically out@@ dated and scar@@ c@@ ely competitive for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar@@ s must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organization .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the export of raw sugar would generate around 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the first words of Cu@@ ban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro in his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , the shut@@ down of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full salary for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez has worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about closing the factory , the word he repe@@ ats the most is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sc@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order to preserve the place , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first closing year , the first letters began to come .
it was officially recorded documents which differ only with regard to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date .
all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility was postpon@@ ed and the letters came more and more frequently .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the factory shut down for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in use , &quot; he ass@@ ures .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , wa@@ its for retirement in another plant , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved against his will in the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction he helped .
with each part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 working years .
the best developed industrial zone in Cuba and the most important work station was extingu@@ ished .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for the jobs and services generated by the facilities in the municipalities where they were located .
we will never know if during M@@ amm@@ ut speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then president was looking at the eyes of the persons present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories had no longer been in operation for five years , everything would go well .
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane factories
sugar cane has been extracted only highly since 2004 .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to disman@@ tle them , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ve the road ; this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they became spare parts .
without a future perspective many young people left the region .
a food factory was created in the area whose production does not even serve to supply the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
forty @-@ nine yields give the old soldier a pension of two thousand p@@ eso per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a supporting person , yet he does not forgive the lies he told him .
they have tor@@ tured him for ten years .
N@@ ene is reti@@ ring at age 65 , not because he lacks power , but because he is bitter .

the workshop reflects the young participants in talks like &quot; cultural identity , language , confrontation , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; or whatever comes to mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ bu@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia tells , for example , the history of Highway 16 , also called &apos; Highway of tears &apos; , a street section in Western Canada , where almost two dozen usually indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered .
the cases were largely not elu@@ ci@@ dated .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey the importance of the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influence of global@@ isation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the teenagers do not always speak native languages of the First Nations .
in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly of Nor@@ th@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop @-@ Group , who gave them a verse in the dialect of Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an , the verse is available in tran@@ scription , as well as a translation into English translated into German :
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
this is the day you will hear our cry
because as a youth we have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and move forward as well as our youth
so they can do what they meant to the Creator .
in the comments section , the reader and advoc@@ ate of Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the verse in sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ us ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( also a part of the world ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan you can see almost every restaurant plastic dishes .
in order to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( also , the &quot; Plastic Models of the Cour@@ ts &quot; ) are exhibited by each dish that is served in this restaurant .
customers look at these plastic dishes and decide whether they want to enter the restaurant or move on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
the Tokyo @-@ G@@ a film maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend now turns them into striking cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets .
with Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sales : new mobile phones decorated with plastic rib@@ bons , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial food were turned into kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge mag@@ nets :
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin refrigerator mag@@ nets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in food orders is becoming more and more complex .
in this case , an imperial @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was turned into a cell phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
we also made this part for the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple holding your cell phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile , this is already a great design .
and that is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the Com@@ ic .
some cell phone stands and mobile designers allow you to make your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a , or salmon roe , is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there anyone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; w@@ ow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile with laugh@@ ing che@@ ats ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take on a lesser appeti@@ zing form to surprise colleagues or family members .
our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of mel@@ ted ice .
in addition , there are also pad@@ dy balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and cell@@ ulose strips made of dried salmon .
for more sk@@ ur@@ ry plastic dishes , you can look at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # 2 .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , dedicated to supplying the restaurant industry . as for example with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; in Mexico , the missing and killed regularly appear only in statistics . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
the reporting on drugs bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background .
the day after a violent incident hardly anyone looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
there are behind every body , behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never heal .
therefore , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; live with the traffi@@ cking of drugs &quot; ) , which will give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were in the struggle between the law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico specifies the project like this :
organized crime lets us not only fear our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
for example , when businesses close , because they are threatened by drug dealers , and so many kilometres have to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk .
the P@@ ain of the Vic@@ tims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how fear changes life &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches for secret graves after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on a single day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like every Sunday , we prepare ourselves again for the task we have set ourselves to go and search for tom@@ bs , according to the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
on October 15th he should be back , but he never returned . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training .
there is also my mother , who is here with me .
at the moment , she has no income .
you are the insurance of my father , but he doesn &apos;t pay them out because they require a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get this ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the conflict , the frag@@ ility and the leadership of the international community . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter in what form it appears :
I have known illness and sensation journ@@ alism for several years now .
I visit newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the front pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from experts from experts .
it brings me out of my compos@@ ure .
sometimes I feel as though I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this to be normal .
she continues to write :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cous@@ in thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug traffi@@ ckers ) when he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something like that happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ action of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified by the fact that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wat@@ ered &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they are trying to persu@@ ade them to remain spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they are not moving and silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months of black@@ mail in the main city district : how a family with threats was pl@@ under@@ ed . &quot; in this she describes how an armed det@@ ective month spent money from her business until she had not only destroyed the business , but also tore her family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your entire life in just a few days .
the pain never passes , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we will contact you only if it is absolutely necessary .
the far@@ ther we are from each other , the better .
she concluded her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will kidn@@ ap or kill you .
in these aw@@ ful days I wonder@@ ed if weeping would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted emotions , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to cry . I have to learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man killed by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like any other boy of his age , whose parents care for her .
Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he says he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , make potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells about the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years earlier when he was only a few blocks away from his home , seeing the bloody body of his father who was shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as a violation of organised crime and the struggle against the existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world based on the number of mur@@ ders according to the Government of Public Security and the Government of the Government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the prosecution weigh@@ ed 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to 8.5 mur@@ ders per day .
these are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose objective is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed conflict against drug trade , which has tor@@ mented the country over the last four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this article and the pages to which he links contain images on which violence is depicted .
the check is important at a moment when it comes to picking up a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
but what is the year after something has emerged the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist .
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first release , it has been widely used to portra@@ y trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is abundant dili@@ gent reporting on events occurring in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
in 2010 , a tank truck tra@@ vers@@ ed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country had been neglected for years and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became dangerous paths full of po@@ thol@@ es that were difficult to drive .
tra@@ gically , the tank truck fell victim to it .
local authorities described a fire@@ ball that envel@@ op@@ ed dozens of houses including a movie theater that was full of people looking at the football World Cup .
houses burned and char@@ red cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned for in@@ denti@@ ality .
a picture titled &quot; That &apos;s Nigeria . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the horri@@ ble scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ red bodies that are lined up on the floor while people look at them .
but here the story does not end .
over the years , the same photo was edited several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms and wrong@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , the B@@ oko Har@@ am fighters attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses dras@@ tically reported atro@@ cities from which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and cor@@ p@@ ses lay in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one left to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the inhabitants of Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many had been dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images the following time could be depicted .
the attack was also un@@ solved , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerged from the DR Congo , as it was fal@@ sely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented access to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the picture was presented as a receipt for mass kill@@ ings .
one step further , personal comment@@ aries such as this example fal@@ sely link the image from DR Congo with sources of mass media to provide arguments .
the picture of S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a blitz@@ krieg , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee were beaten , rape and several dead , some through burning .
while others reported of the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following appeared , which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi @-@ Arab news website , fal@@ sely claimed that President Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ ein has said that monks and politicians have participated in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from DR Congo to illustrate this information .
the original contribution , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be viewed here .
other news organizations , who called AF@@ P as their source , also fal@@ sely attributed Th@@ ein to this statement , but had not brought the picture out of the DR Congo .
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these false dec@@ ou@@ sions date back to 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
with the help of an inver@@ ted image search , you can see how far information can cross borders .
an inver@@ ted image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures under 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the mentioned image of the DR Congo .
they come from a mix of private sites , social media platforms and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages , such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have forwarded false reports , some have attempted to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have restricted examples of impro@@ per use and linked them to the respective countries , on the basis of what they were published on which side they were published . by this we want to represent the range more clearly than by language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which were also linked to each other in some cases ) , several examples of impro@@ per use can come from .
here are some cases which can be felt completely ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News frames .
examples of incorrect coupl@@ ings of the picture from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers where the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or false al@@ erts are still available .
the Coun@@ tries in Gra@@ y are examples that , according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ Eye , are likely to show counter@@ fei@@ ting examples .
as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a Th@@ reads to the &quot; War of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

one side that suggests rum@@ ors was that the said photo shows Christians killed by Muslims .
Canada , 2015 .
in this article a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City names not only the false report but also disc@@ usses the mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions about the intentions of the people and the trage@@ dies involved ( in DR Congo and beyond ) .
Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nigeria est@@ Ã¡n qu@@ em@@ ando a los cris@@ ti@@ an@@ os &quot; ( in Nigeria they burn the Christians ) .
in this article about explo@@ sions in North Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ ca , the district is identified as the Christian part of the town .
La Rep@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ ca cited as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( although it is not known whether the original report has included the picture ) .
France , 2015 .

Iran , 2012 .
an association of the students of the@@ ology ( mul@@ l@@ ahs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims on the N@@ asi@@ m news agency and used to illustrate the image of the DR Congo .
Italy , 2015 .
a resident of P@@ ie@@ di@@ ca@@ stell@@ o from Tren@@ to posted this message to his side to express his solidarity with the massacre in Nigeria in 2015 .
Nigeria , 2012 .
even in Nigeria , the photo from DR Congo as evidence of the bom@@ b@@ ings of B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano was shared in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from DR Congo , on the one hand a tweet , expressing sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger to deli@@ ght@@ fully investigate the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are being used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government has published a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliberately fin@@ alised news and photos that international media , international human rights organisations and governments &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings about Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this recti@@ fication , which has been published exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of sc@@ ents used by H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to explain that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often spread by bur@@ mes@@ an nation@@ alists ) .
Russia , 2012 . &quot; angi@@ ography of a spec@@ ulation ? &quot; ( Christi@@ an@@ opho@@ bia or political pro@@ vocation ? ) .
this post , directed to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , makes it clear that the image of the DR Congo is NOT Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar has admitted Th@@ ein Sein in 2012 , that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the picture from S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still included in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 about students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am published by the news @-@ page An@@ Ã¡@@ li@@ sis Digital , which is now deleted from the Catholic Church , has expressly declared that the picture does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it represents a &quot; similar &quot; jihadi@@ st attack .
when the picture was circul@@ ated later in connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 , the paper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there would be connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ov@@ y@@ or@@ fertili@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world is sleeping ) .
the picture of the DR Congo emerged , marked with this Twitter h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities would pay greater attention to those events suspected in the name of Islam .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was weather@@ ed as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ret@@ ched ) , but the messages related to it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the goal was to focus attention on the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media reporting in comparison to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( portu@@ gu@@ ese ) , 2014 .
after a message allegedly written by a &quot; father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this in Vietnam@@ ese , decl@@ aring that it was false .
from the message contained in the image of the DR Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ ine mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos have dist@@ anced themselves .
there are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the folder in grey ) also reject Tin@@ Eye , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , the Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the Web@@ craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which only appeared clearly after the original publication of 2010 , the picture may eventually have a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( frames ) that go through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used for greater discussions on silence in connection with the mur@@ ders of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the mur@@ ders of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ rated compared to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question , however , is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with social media , there are tens of people who un@@ intentionally participate in tr@@ am@@ pling the water around a tragedy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
does this mood of false and false information suggest that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and does it decorate the real horror of what has actually happened in DR Congo , Nigeria and in Myanmar ?
the dis@@ semination of violent images has already been extensively deb@@ ated ( for example ) .
one argument is that with@@ holding images of a refusal to recognise the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images are des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ zing readers and spectators and taking the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investig@@ ates how violent media seem to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss about violent represent@@ ations in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
technologi@@ sts are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be used detached from the context or completely impro@@ per kind .
however , each investigation of incorrect write @-@ ups should also take into account how internationally they can be .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons uses according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. un@@ insur@@ able ) stri@@ ves to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not at all translated .
such words exist in each language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well @-@ known today ( like the famous Portuguese Saudi ) and others deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish Sob@@ ret@@ esa ) .
but all stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly resist any attempt of a simple translation .
a word or phrase is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context is required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected in an online list for quite a while .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ Trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
for example , in the blog you can find words from the Mw@@ ot@@ lap language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - strive for your parents in recognition of how you have been concerned about you in your younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and words in the Hun@@ s@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness you feel after being war@@ med in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog About :
they un@@ veil other cultures , reveal other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page want to publish more of these &quot; insur@@ moun@@ table &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive are these small languages .
speakers of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Languages , &quot; which are highly appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favourite destinations here .

how Sri Lanka deals with the worst floo@@ ding disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floo@@ ding and land@@ slide disaster in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon who normally uses the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , N@@ il@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya have come across the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
following an opinion from the Sri L@@ ank@@ an catastrophe centre on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and scar@@ c@@ ely hundreds of people are missing because of the floods and mud waves .
more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100,000 people have been brought to 304 shel@@ ters .
the rain falls on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas decreased slowly .
health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the floo@@ ding catastrophe :
floo@@ ding in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et regularly provide updates on flood situations .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods are wor@@ sen@@ ing the crisis of the Den@@ gue , Save the Children warns when further rainf@@ alls are already on their way .
this morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus stood in the high water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also floo@@ ded because of the water p@@ eg@@ els of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force provided five aircraft for rescue operations and another five are ready for the transport of emergency supplies for the residents included in their floo@@ ded villages .
various organisations and startups are also ready to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams require dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call today number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if you need help in this area .
the taxi @-@ call @-@ app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks anxi@@ ous people to share their location data with the help of the app , so that the catastrophe centre is informed .
last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood control &quot; button which allowed users to call a vehicle for pick @-@ up assistance and donations . they were then forwarded to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross for free .
they also introduced a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button , which resulted in more than a thousand inquiries and 150 successful boat rescue operations caused by floods and land@@ slides .
the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , provide security and support for residents in need .
this has prevented the loss of other human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to the restoration of norm@@ ality .

the Women &apos;s March 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
in January I participated in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and dear friend .
I have trusted in her my four years old daughter , she entru@@ sts to me her children ; she is my rock in the fire .
in the last minute we still call slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next we add rights for trans@@ gender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with a head cloth high , bound from an American flag , others sk@@ ew slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my friend looked at me and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things don &apos;t concern you , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who know me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built up in their imagination .
they dis@@ like me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves with being Muslim in different ways . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims do not fit in there , they will be dis@@ car@@ ded .
to be dem@@ ol@@ lim@@ ated
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this has even happened to the poet , whose poetry is best sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which pictures come to mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ? peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Qur &apos;@@ an and Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry until the day he died .
but in the Western concept , the religion of Rum@@ is was extingu@@ ished , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a large part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist paintings of Muslims who have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this enti@@ cing ima@@ gery is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
in the 1970s , the ground@@ breaking Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid dis@@ integrated the story behind these images .
but these pictures still stand out today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to understand them .
I have been working in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful , er@@ ron@@ eous narr@@ atives dominate our news feeds .
this narrative over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed the reality that over the past three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the US won &apos;t even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this narrative fails to recognise that if French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings and Saudi , Muslim women by their government are forced to cover their entire body , these are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it looks beyond the fact that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who had been brought here with slave vessels .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has occupied our collective imagination such deep and flaw@@ ed that often Si@@ kh men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
of the 1.7 billion people
in the news industry , we do more than just stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives which help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the narrative of 1.7 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims make up the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ speaking Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims are among the first @-@ generation immigrants origin@@ ating from 77 countries .

four decades ago , my immig@@ rant parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother presented her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then , when Khan was re @-@ imag@@ ining the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were ir@@ res@@ isti@@ ble Muslims and Americans .
but am I now a Muslim and an American ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting out of my Muslim recipes or my handy pocket order , which all Muslims wear - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa @-@ W@@ ing . &quot;
I j@@ ok@@ er , we don &apos;t carry all the ker@@ chiefs with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists trying to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced on the ongoing tape by a well @-@ lubric@@ ated anti @-@ theft machine with fin@@ ders , think tanks and false information experts who have manipul@@ ated our already er@@ ron@@ eous image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , have manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is more than just a foreig@@ ner who tear a towel out of a woman .
or as the sc@@ ary map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole US , see below .

Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its most ug@@ ly forms is att@@ acking our affili@@ ation .
it acc@@ esses our identity , which is so far @-@ reaching , so versatile and complex that it cannot fit into a drawer .

I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim but to be a Muslim was only born in my imagination when I was four years old , in a temporary mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they resort to the following terms : belief , behavior and belonging .
my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there .
maybe my girlfriend , my neighbor , my rock in the surf , would see that I &apos;m Muslim if she could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the all @-@ ni@@ gh@@ tly ritual with my daughter , when I kept her in my arms and whis@@ pered the Arabian verses to protect the Qur &apos;@@ an and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them I repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .

belonging is the image of my grand@@ mother , mat@@ ernal side with her sisters ; how to win a competition of art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi before decades .
it is the picture of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and un@@ finished paintings painted Su@@ fi he@@ er ; and a Qur &apos;@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be Muslim is to speak the prayers she had told me to speak when I have a bad day .
being Muslim is how she taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people that , for centuries , has been colon@@ ized by an &quot; Empire &quot; that has established a company called Hon@@ orable Bri@@ tian Eastern Line Company , it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord .
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .

belonging is to grow up and to hear that men do not cry but at the same time to see that my immig@@ rant grandfather cri@@ es .
in the meantime , while he wrote books about modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana J@@ aan wept over his family in K@@ ash@@ mir , ruled by India that he could not close his arms in half a century .
belonging to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , like my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have divided the Muslim world as at the game risk .
to be Muslims is to know that in the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; colon@@ ized &quot; all except four Muslim countries .
it means to know that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was dropped over a Muslim country a century ago .
it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , K@@ ash@@ mir submission to the British empire , was described as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mos@@ que in England .
even before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I had ever been and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

belonging to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ acknowledged history .
it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops across every continent apart from Antar@@ c@@ tica , had gone to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried under the rub@@ ble of war .
being an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has increased by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy s@@ nat@@ ches the US and the suspect bears a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white attack .
it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liber@@ ated black slaves .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ist named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim B@@ an .
it &apos;s the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black lives count .
being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist , means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple con@@ junc@@ tions , but to fail to communicate them to others .
the narrative of the 1.7 billion bears more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reducing doubt &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot;
to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged individuals er@@ ect structural anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in the Muslim registry , which began with President Bush and expanded under President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
she is in the immigration official who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child into hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in a country that closes its borders on people from just the countries that bom@@ bed it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ fly list &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which largely targets Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars that we run and the bombs that we are throwing to Muslim lands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study called A@@ scent of Man , scientists from the Nor@@ th@@ western University showed a scientifically correct image and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversations that we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deeply involved to portra@@ y the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are decades back in recogni@@ zing the roots of our fears and the er@@ ron@@ eous and dangerous forms of expression that we have in our news editorial offices .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims in the media industry trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast Lake Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the Pod@@ cast # good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ Bad@@ Muslim ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ el@@ o Square about black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increase Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this gives me hope .

but I am concerned about this difficult global time point in which we are .
and that moment has consequences that go beyond 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet now lead the White House .
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
a few years earlier , it had not yet existed ; now they have ma@@ stered large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history of which I was not aware when I was as old as my daughter is now , but who made me today an ir@@ responsible Muslim .
things I left here like a bread@@ cr@@ umb line in my speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; things that may evo@@ ke memories , for in all the inter@@ sections that constitute our humanity , a story may lie where someone is made &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversations within the framework of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia are taking place .
more than a hundred ac@@ adem@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural rac@@ ism , &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why am I telling this at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where , however , Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are w@@ aged and people are portra@@ yed by creating the &quot; other &quot; in the public imagination , four decades ago , even scientist of Stan@@ ford was .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of being conscious and un@@ aware of the &quot; other &quot; ; just as my girlfriend and I do in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have no president , the chocolate cake is bombar@@ ded , while he is already bombing broken countries and &quot; to other made &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1,7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art wants to preserve urban language diversity
stor@@ y@@ telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ user Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way to get in touch with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer to them .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another Steven Bird initiative , the un@@ en@@ for@@ ce@@ able blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , there is a risk that small and non @-@ so small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
the following applies to the makers of the project :
the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that accept diversity - safe environments where residents don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to it is often associated with understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events , instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen to appreciate , feel , touch &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ y@@ t@@ ellers first introduce and translate their history in their own language , or then explain them in English .
even if the participants are not professional stor@@ y@@ t@@ ellers , their devotion and representation lead to the fact that the audience insi@@ sts on it .
they evo@@ ke laughter and emotion , as if the language no longer has a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ y@@ t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art .
in another event , John Ny@@ ug@@ in@@ sky tells the f@@ ables of the rab@@ bit and the bab@@ oon in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; &quot; &quot; after explaining the meaning of his parable , John Ny@@ ug@@ in@@ sky is asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is this to speak to an audience who doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a broad smile , he shares his sense of inclu@@ si@@ veness : &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were entirely with me !
up to now , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project can come in contact with T@@ LS to organize their own stor@@ y@@ telling .
Puerto Rico claims re @-@ establishing sovereign debt from the US
with the aim of re@@ viewing the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounts to 72 million US dollars , several religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017 ; the march started at the Cap@@ it@@ ol , the capital of the capital , and went to Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( People &apos;s Front for the ne@@ ural check of debts ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church meeting of Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of re @-@ establishing the debt also filed a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos demand that the politicians , bank@@ ers and government authorities responsible for debt be held accoun@@ table for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a management board without any personal interest in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding compensation which acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos are ref@@ using to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not settle down with dec@@ lining pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not the sovereign territory of the United States integrated into the con@@ federation - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervisory authority .
these are their reasons :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico necess@@ it@@ ates extensive restructuring of the state infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; measures imposed from outside will be threatened without the participation and conviction of citizens to be rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration was named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Night vi@@ gi@@ l for light and truth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

it pays homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
this book aims to discuss how to build movements for Free Knowledge and what are the real costs associated with it .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense from our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ m , the beloved and celebrated Internet Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was taken from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Coll@@ ective rec@@ oll@@ ection gives his friends and family a voice that pus@@ hes for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , instantly .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has let many of us begin thinking about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose for ?
what have we given up at times of extreme beliefs in this process ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred to an unknown place from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; Military Police &quot; Bass@@ el on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court removed from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she was contacted on 12 November 2015 by persons who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
his where@@ ab@@ outs and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a decisive role in extending access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently the manager of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ que &apos;s cultural prototypes was more predic@@ tive than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross of many civili@@ zations and here Greek @-@ Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time Bass@@ el could not yet know that ten years after he began this work , the IS would make everything possible to wipe out this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this strip into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be inv@@ alu@@ able for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el couldn &apos;t finish this project until now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was already in jail .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( waiting ) , a commission which she wrote in the years 2012 @-@ 2015 to her husband when he was in jail .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together on the book for one year .
she s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed the lyrics to him when she visited him and translated her from Arabic into English .
the book is available license @-@ free .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here is an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It Happ@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happens at every visit ,
that I am vers@@ ed in the world of your be@@ wit@@ ching eyes ,
that I lose the mind in the moment we embrace ourselves ,
that each of the haz@@ ards doesn &apos;t matter to me ,
each f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kl@@ es and guards
I forget the pris@@ ons of the prison
and I enter into every detail of your voice and words
which I carry with passion with me ,
when your eyes say good@@ bye
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I return quickly to my sol@@ itude ,
to rec@@ laim all the moments ,
and to we@@ ep and smile over your absence .
I convince myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bass@@ el G@@ haz@@ i wrote :

during the process
I am in your cage ,
and you are still in the cage of monsters
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boiler history is not unique in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of protests in 2011 against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those arrested or disappeared under force by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
until 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ ne@@ sty International , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in detention since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
today , we reiter@@ ate our call for the hope we have to do this for the last time .
Moz@@ ambique : after the release of corruption , the director returned to previous post
Moz@@ ambique re@@ acted with anger on a corruption incident in which a member of the government returned to the office in the state apparatus after half of his sentence to which corruption was committed .
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and , together with four other def@@ end@@ ants , was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment for the destruction of 54 million Me@@ tic@@ al ( about 800@@ ,000 euros ) .
the money came from public funds from the airports of Moz@@ ambique , whose advice was provided by Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 due to good leadership and immediately called for his re @-@ adjustment to the company , which took place on 19 April .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic who rejected the application , there would be no barrier for Cam@@ ba@@ za to refer back to his old post because the firm did not undertake any disciplinary proceedings after his detention .
however , many people do not welcome the action .
in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and under@@ lines the lack of transparency and is even a backward step in the efforts of our legal system , such as C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we take note is that the firm should also initiate a disciplinary proceedings against the contrary .
the company apparently kept silent however and did not hesitate to take appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Moz@@ ambi@@ can social media , also re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disgu@@ sting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent type , he would be a consultant after being sentenced to jail and half of which had been served .
he could hold lectures and motiv@@ ate speeches , he could advise and polish up his image .
but being in@@ competent , he cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inflic@@ t harm .
consequently it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence .
re@@ fut@@ ed !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Muslim and student of political science in Brazil says , the director no longer possessed any mor@@ als :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t believe that one rewards someone in such a way that has already insul@@ ted the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cam@@ ba@@ za failed to return to morality and to serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served itself in the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as if it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself was tired of this man who was pre @-@ charged and finally sentenced to a long prison term .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , that a th@@ ief is in prison :
thi@@ eves belong to the Sam@@ ora mach@@ el prison and will not only be remembered by the Moz@@ ambique as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , inc@@ isi@@ ve and - by the way - proph@@ etic speakers .
one of his most famous verbal represent@@ ations was when he confirmed vigor@@ ously that &quot; an ambitious human being is capable of everything , even the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest , to sell . &quot;
Sam@@ ba also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that it &apos;s not like that . he changes tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , an ambitious human being is criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment , he spent 10 years and was released .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users wrong@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ itting . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the network because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook is cens@@ oring the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or Tow@@ ards ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese writing ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ating conn@@ ot@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may be associated with rac@@ ism today , but the word itself does not automatically evo@@ ke hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that posts where they discussed the use of the word or expressed doubt for their use have been cens@@ ored .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with different mean@@ ings , which have the same letter sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , Bur@@ m@@ ese chair is also written as &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( Sp@@ age b@@ lower ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ hair &apos; ( curtain ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ b@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like this : &quot; &quot; &quot;
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he had asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n .
the sentence ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - is very similar to the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ ats believes that it will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook needs to be more analytical before del@@ eting all posts that are suspected of propag@@ ating rac@@ ism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook does not delete the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on a fac@@ t@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the words next to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists who spread hate speech have received quite a good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise her nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to everyone who dis@@ semin@@ ates hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative way of writing the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his posts when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is ban@@ ished by the social network :
... when I was aware of this new Facebook policy , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my mail was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from li@@ cking , posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the post was not met by the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intention or simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
posted without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author gave his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example , the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community to ask for advice :
Facebook likes to have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through its platform , but so it does not work .
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities .
in addition , it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; pe@@ a curr@@ y . &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the wrong@@ ly solved posts .
if they had a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that gave them a great turnover , that would be great .
automatic cens@@ orship causes a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts containing no hate speech but were still removed :
used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as curr@@ y and watch an Indian film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just to try out if Facebook removed the mail containing the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence have increased .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should also heat up violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook was critici@@ zed for his failure to control the prolifer@@ ating hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages .
but instead of just cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; it would have been better going to look at context rather than on code concentr@@ ating initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is at the end with the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the country &apos;s parliament unanim@@ ously approved a law to ban this practice , so that the age @-@ bearing age is now 18 .
before this change of marriage , some members of Hin@@ du and Muslim denom@@ inations adher@@ ed to the practice , and in May 2016 there was a great public out@@ cry . at that time , Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the Inter @-@ Religi@@ ous Organization ( I@@ RO ) , said that the State should not interfere , as that is , age does not have maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the United Nations Convention on Children &apos;s Rights , the min@@ ors as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defined every person under 18 years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who had already been married at 15 in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago was 2.8 percent , and at 18 it was 8.@@ 1 percent .
in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office confirmed that between 1997 and 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married at 19 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements , which were striving to aboli@@ sh laws for children &apos;s marriage , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this result .
however , everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about saying the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they were supposed to take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this really un@@ complicated situation , and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the bill at all .
but at the beginning of 2017 the draft law against the children &apos;s marriage was decided - despite four sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country must agree and let the law be announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators posted a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ An@@ n Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ ag@@ ram once more :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the draft law against the children &apos;s marriage was voted in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes and none of them voted against it .
after it was decided previously in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of social media users were thri@@ lled because the laws for children &apos;s marriage were finally changed .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is a minist@@ erial post in the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk that obsc@@ ured the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is worth almost every price .
while Abel Jackson thought that it took a long time to aboli@@ sh the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al - Thomas , which says : , , Out@@ standing News !
the Act has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , - 35 for this - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group , which was quite open about the importance of the adoption of the law , said : &quot; &quot; &quot;
the age @-@ bearing age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now 18 years independent of religious affili@@ ation .
the draft plan for the amend@@ ment of the married couple was decided today , on 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 of them were present during the voting .
all de@@ pu@@ ties who were present have voted for the law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children &apos;s marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a long fight ( ... ) # shiel@@ ded shiel@@ ds .
many thanks to all the activists who fought against him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the country &apos;s best @-@ known Hin@@ du organisation .
months ago , Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take judicial action , the law should be passed , and he seems to make his promise now .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , an advoc@@ ate of the law , said it was quite legitimate when Mahar@@ aj wanted to go against the law , most social media users wanted to approach the debate in a different way .
Patricia Vor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
dear Sat , instead of discussing the discussion so broad@@ ly , in a way that can only evo@@ ke panic and dis@@ grace , instead of talking about the problem that the state , our daughters , protects that it may be mis@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled males who are opposed to them , &quot; would you then be willing to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to legal action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the child marriage is legal or still the norm , even though there are laws that prohi@@ bit it .

for more than a month Turkey has blocked the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle .
day after day it becomes clearer how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blocking .
although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to using b@@ yp@@ assing tools for blocked websites ( a current article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence in the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking article from Wikipedia , as recently described in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular blocking of the Internet has been taking place since 2007 after the Internet Law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted .
after China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform continues to be locked , several mirrors ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and often updated ) are now sur@@ faced .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) when the platform cleared all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its de@@ centralized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. machine computer connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
the content is available in spite of the legal prohibition .
in a blo@@ g@@ post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after listening to the news ( via Wikipedia ) , we put everything in place to take snap@@ shots from Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the content in a distributed and distributed manner .
this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia articles , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia @-@ Foundation , and it is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .

it is not a complete copy of a proxy address , a mirror .
one accessing a different URL that is not the original . that which one sees then is from Wikipedia .
in essence , the server further direc@@ ts the request to the right Wikipedia page , so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself when locked in Turkey .
for this is carried out by a server that is not in Turkey .

and his hom@@ etown , right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this privileged situation helps him in his work :
I live at the edge of the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ ra ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti River would be a le@@ op@@ ard .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started to kin@@ dle pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar seeks cooperation with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he should know &#91; it &#93; , for he stood by reason of tig@@ ers face to face :
a tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep during sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
bed@@ time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the King of the bush appeared . he immediately sat down , we look at us and he star@@ es me through the sc@@ arf @-@ trees ! !
&quot; &quot; &quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I click for conservation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Ot@@ ters at Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation .
check out some of these photos below .

this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally appeared on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version has been re @-@ published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women with utmost care avoid speaking the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that they respect the husband on the basis of social pressure , as well as the fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm , maintain this practice in life .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted of the Indian State of O@@ dish@@ a by a false court and exp@@ elled from her family and the village community after having addressed a married relative with his name .
the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives by name is also common among men . however , they have far fewer ad@@ mitt@@ ances to fear , if any , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel and house@@ wives , joined a unique club and became the main topic of discussion of the city .
it is a place only for them alone , where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ pl@@ al , which is run by the Community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and stands for the disman@@ tling of the patri@@ archy .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ x has been working with her video camera for seven years on the discovery of practices , such as children &apos;s marriage and the exile of HIV / AIDS infected individuals , and manages these clubs .
she reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion was about women who did not name their hus@@ bands on their behalf .
she chose this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
not to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands al@@ oud , is a custom that they have all aff@@ or@@ ted and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is regarded as dec@@ eit@@ ful , as a woman without mor@@ als .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about it until this discussion round .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try out at home as it is going .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini nar@@ rates :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said that I should call him by his name from now on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini launched her first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to initiate the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , anno@@ yed , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked them all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about breaking a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women can never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini nar@@ rates :
a woman was so shy that she was ch@@ ast@@ ening during the whole exercise ; another decided to leave out all the pent up fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sing it .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in the adren@@ aline rush about having broken with an ancient tradition , the women decided that at home they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands on their behalf .
and they kept their word .
over the next few days , Roh@@ ini has received a large number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in her head : his wife couldn &apos;t stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini thought I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation became violent .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing a finger @-@ red dot on the forehead indicating the status of the marriage :
why do women just have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would wear the interest @-@ red dot if he did it too .
he just laugh@@ ed and I stopped wearing it .
the other women have not stopped completely with it , but think that they are now in a better position to choose for themselves not to wear it on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip on every discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear what could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent months , for the first time in their lives they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they d@@ anced and sang and spoke about things they had never thought of before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so hon@@ estly about some things , for example how our identi@@ ties are tied to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say certain things loud , no matter how small they happen to you .
in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothes .
some women in the group have only carried sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most , this is okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ man @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pair of trousers ; they didn &apos;t dare .
after much stri@@ fe and discussion about the advantages of their choice of clothes , the mor@@ als associated with the sar@@ is and much more , s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed Roh@@ ini added their own pair of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ shirts ) into a discussion round so that the women could wear them .
next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will do it .
on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things are moving slowly :
we have only done small steps so far .
some women tried it a few times , but then stopped saying the name of her husband .
some of them , including me , do it , but only when they are alone and no other family members are there .
only one or two still say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their forehead now at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the viol@@ ets for more freedom of movement or the choice of clothes - lie at the end of a river that is difficult to navigate .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how to explain Roh@@ ini :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am also .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first visit of Japan &apos;s popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a memorial day
the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the official Beat@@ les YouTube channel .
on June 29 this year was the h@@ ash@@ tag in the Japanese twitter trend , in which many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a sol@@ sti@@ ce in Japanese culture in the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who exclusively inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in 1964 in London , noticed in 2016 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just under five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
the people here have quickly become clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many well @-@ known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the cult band &apos;s music is &quot; more than just a universal language , &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the retail@@ er Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
good morning ! today is the Beat@@ les commem@@ oration day in Japan . I was here in Tokyo 51 years ago .
even today , songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools .
the Beat@@ les kit@@ sch survi@@ ves all .
today , Beat@@ les @-@ memorial day is celebrated .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doll John L@@ enn@@ on is supposed to represent or not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as it is for fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the well @-@ known places connected with the band .
in case you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places you absolutely have to visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fields ( Memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lan@@ e
5 ) ( From the link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
sometimes pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can &apos;t be bizarre enough :
good morning together .
today , Beat@@ les @-@ memorial day is celebrated .
exactly today in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and walked over Abbey Road .
we did the same last year too .
and of course some companies also use the fan base from the market , such as this R@@ amen shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! today is Beat@@ les @-@ memorial day .
and what could it be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; today I will listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so the day is going to run today .
so , we hope that you are here !

bald men are drag@@ ged and killed in Moz@@ ambique
the Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia police warned the population that bald men could be target of attacks in Moz@@ ambique .
photo : An@@ ders Bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0
a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald people for organ trade , presumably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , troubles the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambique . the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from Malawi &apos;s border .
one of the victims was de@@ capit@@ ated and part of the organs had been removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently , they conf@@ essed that the organs of sham@@ ans were used in Tanzania and Malawi .
there was a local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald man could bring gold or wealth , the police spokes@@ man at Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia declared the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Moz@@ ambique .
another group , the aim of kill@@ ings for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN 2016 launched a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya res@@ ides in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who are going to travel to the country :
warning to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Moz@@ ambique , men of bald men in Moz@@ ambique are the goal of ritual attacks , warned the Moz@@ ambi@@ can police according to the latest assass@@ ination of three men of bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ ky Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Moz@@ ambique , said that the local police are already following the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ Rum@@ bal@@ a , Province of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , for probably super@@ sti@@ tious rituals , has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a faith existed , according to which the victims in the head would have power generating wealth .
in recent days , three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country .
Angela F@@ errei@@ ra Sam@@ anth@@ a shared on Facebook the chron@@ ic@@ le of B@@ log@@ gers poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , indicating that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Moz@@ ambique :
I M@@ Ã@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ A E@@ IN Moz@@ ambique , THE S@@ ME ashamed a country in which people would have shame to go to the streets , to demand sex against good marks , and to take sex against good marks , a nation in which people would not hurt honest pursu@@ its , or even take their lives to earn their bread , a country in which neither the al@@ bin@@ os nor k@@ ah@@ le or bald ones are hun@@ ted for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes or &quot; black magic . &quot;
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some did not miss the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re humor .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambique and enthusiastic Twitter utility , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the boss of the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ange and the police spokes@@ man Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zi@@ as , In@@ Ã¡@@ cio D@@ ina , are both bald @-@ headed :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moz@@ ambi@@ can authorities are very worried about the kill@@ ings of people who are just gl@@ it@@ tering . &quot; &quot; &quot;

free Bass@@ el : N@@ eti@@ zen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions of the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel prize winner and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o draws attention in the international community after his attorney announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized due to liver cancer at the final stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state risk ) , having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o demanding the democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ u case as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internal issue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a spokes@@ man told that he considered it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nonetheless , China continues to receive calls from the international community , the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to allow or to allow him a treatment abroad .
while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out .
Hong Kong Free Press has summari@@ zed some reactions from abroad .
United Nations Accor@@ ding to United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
a spokes@@ man , however , refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad .
Norway in Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer any questions about Li@@ u &apos;s release .
the relationship between China and Norway was st@@ alled after the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon exports to China , as the exports were largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope of unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his prize .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately release Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for China to release Li@@ u as she announced on June 30 :
at the same time , we expect China to lift up all the restrictions of Mr. Li@@ u &apos;s wife and family members .
they are to be able to meet and receive all visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
us ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad shared with the fact that the Americans &quot; wish him that he has the opportunity to treat abroad in so far as he can help him with his recovery . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman for the US embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced on June 27 that the message told the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u but also to release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from their house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the call of the US Embassy drew a fur@@ ious response from China , with the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley said that China should offer the couple :
protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his election , to which they claim according to the Chinese constitution and the legal system as well as international obligations .
the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to urge the Chinese government to un@@ condi@@ tionally release Li@@ u and his wife .
I urge China to un@@ condi@@ tionally release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o so that he can get into proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany and Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; receives all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July .
previously , diplomatic sources in Beijing reported to the Reu@@ ters news agency that China had big concerns about whether the vor@@ tex around Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada and Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called on China to provide Li@@ u with appropriate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ u lawyer previously told AF@@ P that Li@@ u X@@ ia , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always supervised the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
Canada is calling on China to maintain its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to allow for the enforcement of these rights .
France and France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry urged China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons in a statement on 29 June :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs regardless of where . furthermore , his wife and family should have contact with him .
while the news channel France Info has already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information on whether France will eventually accept it .
Taiwan Airport in Taiwan
the Council of land@@ land@@ lords in Taiwan suggested China on 27 June to release Li@@ u and show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu M@@ ei @-@ n@@ u of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned about Li@@ u in an explanation on June 28 , and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u &apos;s well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn contributed to a more peaceful world .
I felt personally very moved and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised as an independent state at an international level .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered a city .
this re@@ mark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of the meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York , the Minister re@@ marked that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of Singapore &apos;s only political party because they compared Singapore to other countries .
he supports that Singapore should be considered a city .
... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices , to create this precious land , we hear that we are ultimately not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you &apos;re not my country , whose land is it ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very pos@@ h : he defended an idea , according to which the political system of Singapore could not compete with other &quot; normal countries , &quot; in the light of that , he inevitably appeared un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , cities that are permanently guided by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core of the subject , the good old ly@@ re appears again from the author@@ itarian rulers , who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , aband@@ ons the twi@@ sted logic , because it fits better to its power .
in the end , the answers given by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam last week to his American guests regarding our press , our judicial system , our political system , were truly non @-@ rep@@ lies .
he tar@@ red corresponding questions with non @-@ answers in a rational manner .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion , since she did not understand this conclusion .
personally , I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to what country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very thank@@ ful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to enligh@@ ten this point , provided he was highly paid to be part of the government of Singapore .
by publishing his comment on the blog , he points to the critics that one should begin to read the entire co @-@ ordin@@ ance of the conference so that one could better understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was more of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections are so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , which makes this pol@@ em@@ ic statement as leader of a growing generation .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice said of Singapore ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Guard , what I expected - do I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of political leaders in Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure that he really believes it , associates correctly and is aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review identifies the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; did Mr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam have committed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good faith a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian advoc@@ ate ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , what country do the sovereign rights of Singapore return to ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he plays an important role within the government cabinet , Mr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements are of serious importance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
why do the people of Singapur render their military service , but do not defend their city but not their country ?
who has to pay back our Prime Minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
if the journal Journey of a Dec@@ ade tends to be a Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and has always been a city :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this set seems to have anno@@ yed many Singap@@ or@@ ans ...
nobody has ever said Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country especially &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather talk about the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked its editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
your answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series , with which rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world are revealed and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest part of this series is edited by Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question asked me most in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been living in Japan since 1994 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his conversation partner by asking personal questions .
on my clari@@ fication , most of the time the standard answer follows : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans might cook in@@ war@@ dly against anger if they are held for Americans , but it doesn &apos;t bo@@ ther me .
for someone who does not know himself , there is little that Can@@ adi@@ ans differenti@@ ates us from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans can make a Canadian flag well visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all dear Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand , ... .
so it was already when I began travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried small ear @-@ leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free healthcare system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think , Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant country against ethnic groups .
we are not like these guys south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter to me if you were confused with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
first , to be called &quot; nice &quot; means to be sp@@ ici@@ ously - just like the good , gentle , but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has its own Canadian double @-@ worker ) .
if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
being harmless means being un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and not earning any attention .
this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that happen around you .
I would even go so far as to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of Can@@ adi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool pol@@ it@@ eness . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence across the fence .
we lack the warm , open @-@ hear@@ ted friendliness that I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau was entering the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada almost sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ dy Thailand &apos;s j@@ un@@ ta
a pop @-@ band , famous in Thailand , has released a music video that par@@ o@@ dic@@ ates the j@@ un@@ ta , which seized power in 2014 and despite its promises to restore the civilian government , continues to dominate the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new song &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man who tells you what rules his girlfriend is doing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although not expressly political , the music video still refers to the continued military rule of the j@@ un@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video of the song was a huge success .
within the first three days , the video uploaded to Facebook was 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times divided and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; Der dict@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , in particular to how it beha@@ ves in the position of the country under the j@@ un@@ ta rule .
take a look at these recordings of the video that refers to some of the political issues that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years .
the &quot; 44 Rules of the Girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the preliminary constitution , which gives the supreme commander of the army absolute decision making over important national issues .
the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious programme for &quot; changing the settings &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are considered critics by the j@@ un@@ ta .
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other revi@@ e@@ wers of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was also established in the army that super@@ vis@@ es online content and accused persons accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy to prosec@@ ute .
Thailand employs a strict law against &quot; Read Maj@@ esty &quot; ( maj@@ esty &apos;s insul@@ t ) .
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later , it came to a coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is its decision to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax pay@@ ers .
the video even shows how people are thrown into a black delivery van before putting them into an intern@@ ment warehouse , another problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long imprisonment , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile the te@@ aser of the song showed members of the band , who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by coup opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life continues in ruins of gh@@ ost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ no@@ v , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission .
the post @-@ war society reco@@ vers very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , particularly in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
now more than 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ sic war has been officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ le@@ ch@@ ava are located in the hydro@@ reservoir of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Asia Minor , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , the largest part of Russia and Ab@@ ch@@ asen live in the area .
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost towns in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
during the pre @-@ war period more than 10.000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ ost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the area has been 16.@@ 000 people , having barely risen over a decade .
in 1989 , some 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a result of war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ story residential blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s which are called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ ch@@ uk , are symbolic of the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are exp@@ elled and very rare they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , I met a native elderly man .
he starts a conversation and it is difficult for him to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a result of war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you talk ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is still clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens all serving the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded splend@@ our buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
there are about fifty inhabitants living in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ us@@ h@@ chen@@ ko , which still house one or two families , is recognized by the balconies where washing is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in hand , they retreat right away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Mother has banned us from being photograph@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal use ) such as livestock breeding , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable growing .
it is difficult to come across the rounds .
the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages during the winter .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow cour@@ get@@ tes &quot;
about ten years ago an elderly woman named Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a as she is called in the neighbourhood ) moved from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to J@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her oldest daughter living in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; she says .
Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she supports her younger grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very hard to survive &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells her that she and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when holidays are , we visit us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we can &apos;t do this all the time - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ asha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls her a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could grow cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for a while .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she reminds herself of the village life before the war .
despite its relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the land of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia just broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently we bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take a while , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha will receive approximately $ 9 child benefit for each child .
her husband is working in the coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once located , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chi@@ ckens .
she relates that at first it was a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time it lost its anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war , there was hardly any work and all lived as they were right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I remember every day as the city and the war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when our conversation tends to end , a little boy is running past us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hi@@ des .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
while they run , some of them throw stones on the fallen buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood , which ensure un@@ happiness in their lives .

in Mexico &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants on their long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Tri@@ rez Le@@ ads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border from Mexico to Guatemala .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with kind permission .
on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , located on the Guatem@@ al@@ an border .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is managed by a 59 @-@ year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral pink Bri@@ ll@@ en@@ frame and golden earrings in t@@ ed@@ dy bear form .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . however , they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel doesn &apos;t have any charm .
for about $ 2.@@ 50 the night sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the vesti@@ bu@@ le there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - however , hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants come here .
sometimes , Ms Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez , the people come to the full mini @-@ bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast they start crying : &quot; m@@ um Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has already welcomed 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some even slept on cardboard outside .
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anybody .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are ill , they buy drugs that they cannot pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted by the long journey .
Ty@@ ch@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently .
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Ms Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family Sebas@@ ti@@ ao ( with its daughter Mer@@ call@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bart ) posed with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebas@@ ti@@ ao is traveling with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he says that the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans often travel together and that Afri@@ cans already speak at W@@ hat@@ s@@ app of Ms Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy became weaker , it began its journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ um Africa is our mother and we never leave her again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers , smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez nar@@ rates that her guests often send her text messages when they went to greet her or to tell her about the course of her trip .
she explains that her Christian faith is the driving force of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chi@@ ckens like in Ghana .
MS Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well @-@ known here , but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have welcomed migrants in their little house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to many African migrants are sold too expensive .
he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night .
at the moment , 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what guests are going through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people can help and not help others . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his place of employment .
the majority of migrants traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula come from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them .
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©@@ n@@ dez told me that he fled to people in Honduras with his wife and his three children who wanted to black@@ mail him money without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown woman , a single educ@@ ator , offered him her roof .
a few months later the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go the next step .
back in the house of Mama Afrika , everything is full of guests again .
in the ais@@ les , travelers will consult their tel@@ eph@@ ones quietly .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , most of them from Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grand@@ mother she smo@@ thers her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair ties her an Kun@@ din has made , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly , while she briefly presents her to me .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; she repe@@ ats it every time . &quot; you have gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang of Twitter users .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minorities region in western China , are forced to install sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on July 10 , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of Ur@@ um@@ qi were given a cell phone notification in which it instruc@@ ts the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this announcement , it is said that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should prevent access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities did not use the app for more than comb@@ ating terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because they had exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group shortly after they had installed the app .
the police revealed that the app would identify and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to alert users how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network .
this app with children &apos;s filters will help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; might enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person .
this introduction is in line with other measures to monitor the digital activities in this region .
while announcements about digital cens@@ orship in China often focus on users &apos; experiences in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those living in remote , repres@@ sed ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in the conflict regions , the authorities often prescri@@ be extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Twitter based media outlet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; published in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where police inspec@@ tors random@@ ly checked the inhabitants to see if they had installed the monitoring app . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile message requested that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , you may be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced the people to use devices intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by rest @-@ growth technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images from mainland China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( partly available on @-@ site ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description from which the software can lift up the password request of a Windows operating system and thus obtain un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council to minim@@ ise the dis@@ semination of illegal content .
all government branches , authorities and related institutions , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the cy@@ ber security office on the operation of their computers and communication devices .
a recent Freedom House report , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new monitoring methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities issued a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; with the local police until August 1 .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; ; however , this action infr@@ ing@@ es the personal rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible off@@ ences , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or Death , Part 1 : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything cri@@ es after death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; series in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and realise that you are all alone in a place where everything that is important has disappeared .
everything has gradually dissi@@ p@@ ated and revealed a truth that is clearly recognizable from the inside as well as from the outside .
one that gives honour to their name .
one that has broken down into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but when reality reco@@ vers you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the drama , the beautiful scenes and the actors - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death .
all doubts arise in smoke and you will become aware of your existence , even if the Earth continues on the axis of evil . you realize that you are trapped here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , have built stone around stone .
they arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the security service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five teenagers were torn from the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest as we@@ eds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough for the city to sm@@ ash the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all quarters were cov@@ eted , only my own did not .
for the first time , it was quiet , mo@@ tion@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I did not have high demands on a city that was blocked up into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accompli@@ ces .
in the third night things had a little cal@@ ming effect after the power supply in the neighborhood stopped functioning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my home roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice disgu@@ sting through silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to get together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we alli@@ ed ourselves to a glorious picture full of my expectations .
at such a moment you are aware that you release the mind from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my Father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prepare yourselves , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ amed it all the way to the office of security service from the body .
I arrived there .
the colon@@ el Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me also hear how you write &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you are cour@@ a@@ geous enough to sh@@ out when we are not nearby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes focused on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you really dare to look into my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was due to my foo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my cause when I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t think you &apos;ve forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think I have never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement and his father alike . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is equal with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cursed proposition lies in my nose to this day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a mental torture that I was exposed for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I went through the yard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
then again through the yard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I pre@@ tend to detail all the details before I enter the room .
unlike anything else , they have probably given me a larger cell this time .
I have to share it with just one other prisoner and I must sit right away without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the officer left the cell and I grab@@ bed a tried @-@ and @-@ tested method of communication : beating his f@@ ist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cellular com@@ rade was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; det@@ ain@@ ee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation , he finally answered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; apparently in none of the surrounding cells there was a prominent middle @-@ aged man who looked similar to me and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the perfect darkness , no distinctive features can be seen on me , and there are no doctors here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers deny its existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells .
maybe he will be heard right away .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I stayed .
LÃ¼@@ ft@@ ner .
I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row in order to drive away all those crow@@ s that feed on the fruits in the garden of my head .
from a distance I still hear them shou@@ ting &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always around this time the scre@@ ams , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the colour of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that showed us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( e.g. : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; all@@ usion to the 13th Sh@@ ure of the Quran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are here to be heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this revealed the secret : in order to protect the state security against us and to prevent us from expos@@ ing the tra@@ it@@ or and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - so they played their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow viewpoint of their view of the world .
this is not a house that is not a country here ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero .
I enter the listening room and meet on Abu Ima@@ d , a slim and sto@@ cky man ; at least he pre@@ fers me like that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he begins a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions that der@@ ailed him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join those Ta@@ ge@@ di@@ vines and protest at demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to it , not to reply .
I can no longer say exactly when insul@@ ts and stro@@ kes after a friendly conversation have become an ordinary means of communication for me .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
some voice said in me that I had to get used to being punished or punished , even though I had done nothing to deserve this punishment .
in punishment in all their diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
your exec@@ ution@@ er will delight in your scre@@ ams .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him and you cannot hold back your scre@@ ams .
my scre@@ ams didn &apos;t bo@@ ther him enough , so they exchanged the tube with a cable .
at my first arrest , I asked if the investig@@ ator had worked as a garbage collector or if it belonged to the normal equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables to present us , from their point of view , magnificent invention of a giant cable .
within a single hour , three of them changed while I was still in the row .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling and did not take any fav@@ ors at all , which is why he attacked an electrically charged rod as a neighbour .
electricity flow@@ ed my whole body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood .
my half @-@ naked body lying on the ground was the perfect power conductor .
the de@@ af@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours he decided he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours passed , which occurred to me as minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus mit dir , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted young boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father must be fear@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and move , you will be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and opposition
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time in@@ doors ; sometimes he s@@ miles to his screen , sometimes to his computer , sometimes to his couch .
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips infected with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives on the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel accomplished its occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s family had to flee from their village in Palestine , where they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ es ( such as Far@@ mer ) .
for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and asks their old @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ es@@ eed .
with his music , which often deals with topics like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all of these issues are relevant not only in his home town of Am@@ man , but also in cities that range from Damascus to Syria through to San@@ aa in Yemen .
at the age of 25 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not constra@@ ined by borders in his thinking , and he can feel with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not admit it openly , he has a special a@@ version to the US foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones has something to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees of the second generation . &quot; he describes himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think so because of my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; while he po@@ urs in water dissolved N@@ es@@ cafÃ© in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset .
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with a protest against Islam .
generally speaking , the s@@ war@@ ms speak lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the squ@@ ad@@ ron of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose in the first line of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air , especially when you look at the neighbouring countries .
therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as drinking water in the public during Ram@@ adan - in order not to land in prison .
recently , the Interior Ministry , Jord@@ ani@@ ens , canc@@ eled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , for the second time .
some members of Parliament who support the Islamic Camp@@ aig@@ n - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual front singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pu@@ ties and former press secretary of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters like the Arab Spring , human rights and free expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which raises the tried @-@ and @-@ tested legitim@@ acy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la under@@ estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to opt for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement is probably not simply a rhet@@ or@@ ical rhet@@ oric , but actually mirr@@ oring an ever @-@ clear emerging reality in Jordan which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b dropped traditional gender norms by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a woman who is clearly dist@@ ressed , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the past years , the number of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hon@@ our@@ able mor@@ als &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has taken place in Jordan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of hon@@ our@@ able mur@@ ders reached its zen@@ ith in 2016 ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way .
according to a law on the fight against crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; be held in prison for an in@@ definite period of time , &quot; and for their release , many years of bureaucratic expenditure and the guarantee of the family are often necessary for the woman to take nothing .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s music is also very popular and is well known to not shy away from issues that have long been tab@@ oo in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , from politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politics has been fed me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b seized the question of the Palestinian identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs that are politically at the core can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song one verse repe@@ ats itself remark@@ ably often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot;
in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which one , in his words , &quot; can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ gen@@ eity or homosexu@@ ality .
he notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of ga@@ ys and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on the equality of LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q + individuals were still strongly cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , in order to realize later that his comments were torn out of context , twi@@ sted and cens@@ ored in his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts , but stre@@ amed was only a edited version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is openly campaig@@ ning for the Arab LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als does not correspond to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ eva , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory thanks to his hom@@ opho@@ bic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ eva , who was supposed to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not do that ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian news service established several former members of government and members of the teacher association , argu@@ ing that they have cri@@ tically vo@@ iced concerns about the problems inherent in the country &apos;s deep @-@ rooted corruption .
in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to create a structural re@@ thinking in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has now denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - it sees H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , devo@@ tional and internal changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day at the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without interventions from abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he not only dreams of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experience it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region will be approached by music , art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions and demo@@ cra@@ cies brought about by arti@@ fici@@ ally . at least he hopes that .
until that time , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and consequently resist .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these big extravag@@ ant warri@@ or pupp@@ ets are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ ula festival .
one assumes that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the festive cars , the drums and the dancing have been handed over for more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies of the West inv@@ aded Japan in the north @-@ east to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the emis@@ as , to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ ula festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we could grab a couple of great seats so we have a great view .
one can hardly imagine how large these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital city , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ j@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two festive cars are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ ula festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ uch@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high festive car was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ ans exchange arms against sh@@ ears and raz@@ ors

outside appearances and personal care were seldom as important as in this story , because they help to keep away from crime the Peru@@ vian youth and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the hair@@ dresser .
El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate where street noise and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are all com@@ mon@@ place .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region is not safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend to copy the appearance and thus also the fancy hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) has led to becoming more and more regular citizens in the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers , who can reproduce these complex hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the ultimate limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the hair@@ style competition &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 .
there , experts compete against each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions like the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who are located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people to trade their arms against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of bad advice to get a training in hair@@ dressing technique that allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered , dozens of young people saw that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district to which we are very proud , because out of love for the children we have built this educational community .

isn &apos;t it even more important to meet people who feel ej@@ ected ?
this was exactly the question of the young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ ra@@ ga of the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired them to write Cart@@ as p@@ or la dist@@ li@@ aci@@ Ã³n ( letters of reconciliation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
recently their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part to it : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had signed a peace treaty with the F@@ ARC guer@@ ri@@ lla movement ( German : revolutionary armed forces in Colombia ) , forming the point of view of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the signing of the peace treaty was considered to be so significant that the Colom@@ bian President JosÃ© Manuel San@@ tos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
there is , however , a long way ahead of the Colom@@ bi@@ ans until one can speak of true reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ ri@@ ll@@ as who have lived in illegal camps for many years , who were exposed to war rhet@@ oric and wore their weapons around the clock , must now again integrate themselves into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , which was accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , must now take them into their ranks and support them in setting up a new life .
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bi@@ ans had to join together and help in the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : up to now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back into society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who will then be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for reconciliation was born at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to talk briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ th@@ i , who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more .
he plans to share in this year his love with people who needed most urgently .
so the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC who now have their place in society and build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
so far more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ .
&apos;@@ i never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were delivered on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca .
a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo von der Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art travelled to the camp to personally hand over the letters .
the members of the F@@ ARC were as they had done earlier to receive orders from their leaders .
but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; said Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Gover@@ nor of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former warri@@ or led me through the camp of the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a sort of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ ll@@ as live ) I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go into it , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ gar@@ net , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to him anyway and asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are you doing right now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very beautiful and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; never in my life someone wrote me something so beautiful , so I answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly tears ran on my che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ g@@ ged him and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
perhaps he was also tired of the war , it was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this warri@@ or , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never expected something different from life than a war . joining the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers before star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know there is a society outside that wa@@ its for us with open arms .
until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices and voices
at the start of the event , students and some leader of the F@@ ARC were invited to a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC already acted in secret .
that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC have declared the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the State dealt with the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can help shape society more just in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a goal of this magnitude , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of them said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
to hear these people who have never heard a hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hate , even just people with beautiful feelings turned around by their circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives is hur@@ ting me .
but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and so much damage , can teach us something and give us a smile and embrace .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ Ã­o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
the Colom@@ bi@@ ans were proph@@ esi@@ ed that peace would reign after dis@@ ar@@ ming .
but that is not the case .
as long as there are ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people ready to resort to arms , rise up and protest for their rights . and that is fully justified ( ... ) .
we of the F@@ ARC now focus on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call upon all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those dre@@ aming of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and sacrifice as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

the translation of an article , written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ sum@@ owa , and its first publication on the website OC Media took place .
gay and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with horror , activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months about the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that hangs over the LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q community there has not only emerged overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic .
the LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya won international head@@ lines several months ago after reports have been published that address the deport@@ ation , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic .
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities det@@ ained suspi@@ cious men and put them into secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ man , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
from her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she was grown up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had learned of the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
for fear of her life she moved to the United States in the end .
Sab@@ rina : I was a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organization .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he &apos;d be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them all over the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of mine . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents made the rounds through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
I was attacked on 10 October 2015 .
when I was about to bring out a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your unc@@ le . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you still honor the family , you stain ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up again in the hospital .
apparently some women had received everything and began to scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung .
OC Media : in which hospitals were you placed - in which of the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and laid me on the women .
I am very thank@@ ful for that .
when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for having dealt with me respect@@ fully .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
last February I got threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they asked me to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that it was all a lie .
they posed absurd demands : some told me that I must prove it by running on top without going through the streets ; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Gro@@ z@@ ny and say that I had not changed my gender , that everything was only bad talk , and Photos@@ hop .
I have size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some elderly people spoke once my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has damaged not only your family , but the entire republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother became too much and she put a rope around her neck .
luckily the neighbors came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number sign stood under the window with a 95 .
after it happened for the third time , I realized that something was wrong .
my human rights activists checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to disclose their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help , I left the country , but then something incredible happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before I left Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived .
I bought them without registering myself , without identification , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage .
came and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I received a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t believe you would be safe just because you left the country ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
our people already know at which hotel you are stuck . you even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only to prove it : it is the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
this indeed was my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we do not talk about gender equality , that is a tab@@ oo theme .
some traditionally Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements I still bear in me .
as much as I wish , I can &apos;t overcome this spiritual barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with the camera , I really try to look at the person she reminds of her past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know anything about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have stayed there ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
for him , I needed updated information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who sat in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he told that during Ram@@ adan there were no people arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not lock a new wave .
most likely they will concentrate on family and relatives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so I mean , they probably invite the relatives , these take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : are gay men still trapped in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says that there are not many .
if then , especially those who have no rich relatives or were dropped by their relatives to face Kad@@ y@@ row &apos;s judgment .
as far as I know , they are held there so that they can be presented as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should they be killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people had not simply disappeared , they were deliberately sub@@ merged in order to radic@@ alise themselves .
OC Media : is this only a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was det@@ ained in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people in this prison have disappeared after their beard grew .
there has been nothing new from them ever since .
they simply took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself when these people were taken .
until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there were no reports so far . however , we suspect that such actions are possible .
why else would you not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know whether these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , I had a Bob .
I think that before 2003 I was already known in Gro@@ z@@ ny , when I was still living there - and I never had any problems .
in ear@@ nest !
even between 1998 and 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was applied , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now .
Russia originally intended to lead us to &quot; civili@@ sing &quot; but ultimately has thrown us back into the Stone Age .
OC media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes , wore tu@@ bular je@@ ans and short tops .
the Ministry of Security of Sh@@ aria has never bent my hair on me .
in front of the Russian theater in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we have never been offen@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mock not on the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is often said to children when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you because they thought you &apos;re sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never struck me .
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sab@@ rina : until Kad@@ y@@ rov stepped on the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk about morality in television .
he did not talk about us per se , but rather about the behavior of women .
nevertheless - you could feel how people in the city started to change .
those who had smil@@ ed and laugh@@ ed at first looked at you with suspicion .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the republic steadily deterior@@ ated .
OC Media : what kind of activity do you do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the USA .
apart from that , I am still active as a activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organise tea meetings , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get food maps .
I don &apos;t spend a cent on it .
I discovered these people myself when I picked up the type of refuge .
I am Muslims and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ den@@ off ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s sil@@ ly .
so nature is , it has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to proph@@ esy to you with foam in front of your mouth that there are no ga@@ ys with them .
the dam@@ n@@ ers have what the cab@@ ar@@ in@@ ers have , the Russians have which ; on the whole planet they have - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I &apos;m from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant for me to hear something like that .
I meet here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
know , many think with transi@@ ent to men who love men , and they believe that one changes their sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different kinds of feeling to be exact , different attitudes of life .
for me it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
sorry I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase of suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the last months there has been a sharp rise in suicide .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ ra@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ ra@@ z region in the south @-@ west of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability for his family to pay , so Ah@@ ra@@ zi human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ ra@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had kind@@ led himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was taken to Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ ra@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could not do anything .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi minority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take their lives .
the Ah@@ ra@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id manifest@@ o , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab will have hang@@ ed Tam@@ im .
their stories have one thing in common : it was all fathers of the family who were hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government , to feed their families and to pursue a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the local Arab population to make their living .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy assumed power and in 1925 it made great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ ra@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture .
in spite of these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population receives little from this wealth .
it is often victims of untreated illnesses , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime systematically den@@ ies the Ah@@ ra@@ zi Arabs working places in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government also built a large number of dam@@ s , the water from the Arab areas to the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie .
these dam@@ s have only led to ag@@ grav@@ ate devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness , and destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi young@@ sters rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director General for Cooperation , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ ra@@ z@@ is , who are looking for a job , completed primary school , completed 55 % of a secondary school and 45 % had a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ zi human rights activ@@ ist living in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and ra@@ cial ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ ra@@ zi .
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans emerging in Ah@@ ra@@ z and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
as officials and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi is deprived of access to work opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of the national resistance of young Arabs and force them to earn their living outside their home country of Ah@@ ra@@ z .
there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ ra@@ zi and be hired as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated , let alone speak the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes .
given the circumstances surrounding the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi , human rights activists shake alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for suicide is an untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is prev@@ ent@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I don &apos;t identify with femin@@ ism , even with inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ alism ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
detail of a photo . taken by Pix@@ ab@@ ay . released under the CC@@ 0 Creative Com@@ mons License .
the following article is a revised version of the statement published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ ich@@ and was originally published on the website A@@ fro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions came to expression .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - respond with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even suggest well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me , why I should be femin@@ ist and why we should generally be all femin@@ ist * inside .
for example , women still earn less money today despite equal education than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms always ensure that women come across a glass ceiling sooner or later , and that discrimination on the basis of sex is still across the many different countries and denom@@ inations .
all of this is well known to me and known .
I am convinced that I suffer twice and triple underneath .
I am a black woman .
and yet , when I come to speak on skin color , on rac@@ ism , on black women &apos;s women , black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the di@@ as@@ por@@ a ; if I mention the kind we have been ab@@ used physically , mentally and verb@@ ally , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white fem@@ inists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists have been silent .
however , everyone agrees that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift up their voices and &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to say that in addition to sexu@@ alized violence , there is an institution@@ alized form of ra@@ ci@@ ally motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in tw@@ o@@ fold manner .
or that black women and women of other ethnic groups and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of experiencing domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women .
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all people in every skin color to have the same rights ; on the other hand , as a black woman , I cannot join a movement in whose center the white woman stands , who refuses to consider injustice in her thinking , which relate both to sex and to the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging to a white @-@ femin@@ ist oriented sphere that has always and repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said So@@ jour@@ n in 18@@ 51 : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I too refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a der@@ mal and margin@@ alized being in a historical sense . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropri@@ ation in order to promote their eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c programme .
I will no longer try to explain white women the importance of the overl@@ apping of skin color and gender . some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement still@@ silence , no matter how many black women try to teach them for the better .
although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women different backgrounds a home and to isol@@ ate themselves from the white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name .
I prefer to get rid of femin@@ ism completely and to join the movement of the W@@ om@@ an@@ ism called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of using me for a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradig@@ m that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for ourselves .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , author of the book Afri@@ cana perhaps anism : Rec@@ laim@@ ing ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ anism : as we re@@ conquer ourselves ) speaks of how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can in this way also create spaces in which they can be worshipped perfectly and in which the cultural , spiritual , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped , that make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift up black women and women from other cultures , for in this paradig@@ m I exist .
I am recognized as a part of this paradig@@ m due to my dark skin and my being as a woman .
I , a black woman , can blossom in an environment where my life is neither b@@ yp@@ assed , nor ignored , nor rejected .
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports in@@ special about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
in the context of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published again .
again and again , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled to Iraq in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ boards or in can@@ oe - with a special concern of the Kur@@ dist@@ an Region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .
&quot; I really wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a child , &quot; Mus@@ a tells .
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the Non @-@ Govern@@ mental Organization Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in one question : &quot; if we don &apos;t have any water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and published for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist based in Er@@ bil , Iraq .
the focus of her work is on pursued , little resp@@ ectable sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative Vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with the help of supp@@ ressed congregations who can tell stories in their own way .
Paragu@@ ays Women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women portra@@ ys &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The We@@ eping Woman &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to express her pain on the women &apos;s murder in the country and in the region and to show her rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay &quot; by Cur@@ rent@@ . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ ght@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) , which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
a police inspec@@ tor said A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner who had become violent against her .
since the end of their relationship , some time had passed and the police said their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done .
when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena about mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez &apos;s clear display also did not help .
a few days later , the second woman with@@ drew her adver@@ t .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women make a complaint at all , they generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases women are financially dependent on men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women , who admit to be victims of violence , are at all reported to prosecution authorities .
content 1 Stri@@ kes and Statisti@@ cal 2 In@@ visible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ations and a legal system that &apos;s nothing under@@ min@@ ed Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , poor implementation blows and statistics
it is hard to find out how many women are really ill @-@ treated , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ Ã³n y E@@ studios , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are different information and reports that do not even show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
the available numbers , however , are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , 9@@ 600 were reported to the District At@@ tor@@ ney Office because of domestic violence . 70 % of them were violence against women .
86 % of the ads in police came from women .
there were more than 5000 advertisements for domestic violence in the courts of peace . here again , 86 % of the ads of women came .
in the ads , 40 % of women claimed that they were physically mi@@ stre@@ ated , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
these statistics , however , do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women minister Ana Bai@@ ardi only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; to every woman who reports in Paraguay for psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do so come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every woman ref@@ unded due to physical abuse has two women who do not do so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she stated at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the murder of women in Paraguay is not an own criminal off@@ ence , law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 , journalists accounted for at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country .
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , every ten days in Paraguay a woman dies because of violence through men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a sign with the inscription : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without complic@@ ity , no imp@@ unity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
un@@ seen mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a judicial system that does not take anything
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insist@@ ed that she called him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want it , but then she still gave up . this should regret her forever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer collabor@@ ated with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red psych@@ ic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognize :
I would never have thought that I would once again be victims of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that this only happens to women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they are fo@@ ol@@ ed by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote articles on Facebook where she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship , describing how he had isolated her .
many people answered their posts , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had fallen by Carlos so long and did not leave him earlier .
it seemed almost as though they wanted to say that the victims of abuse had at least a certain complic@@ ity in it .
Victoria San@@ tos , not native to Paraguay , fought with the authorities in Paraguay for almost eight years to prove that her former partner mi@@ stre@@ ated her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ o te Cre@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; network ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , which consists of women , who are all victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the testim@@ onies of women seriously .
in Victori@@ an &apos;s case everything began with psych@@ ic abuse .
her wealthy partner finally managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
Victoria &apos;s ads with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , she received no support .
she led a process against her former partner who developed into an un@@ man@@ a@@ geable legal battle between Paraguay and her native country , in which it mainly revol@@ ved around money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a way of resist@@ ances and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
on August 10 , 2016 a draft law was discussed in the Par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament , which became known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ as ( # for you ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ Easy ) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the original draft of the law proposes to declare fem@@ inists a stand @-@ alone criminal offen@@ se and punish har@@ sh@@ er as is the case in the neighboring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus the legislative text was changed in a number of points to include members of the law , fear@@ ing that the way to de@@ crimin@@ alize abor@@ tions is being lev@@ elled , which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and pun@@ ish@@ able with up to five years in prison .
the original bill had envis@@ aged the large part of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that the victims of violence must bear , if they just want to reimbur@@ se and provide a secure accommodation to the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
in Paraguay , abuse is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here a re@@ thinking must take place so that violence can no longer be seen as normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who are silent in the face of these facts are complic@@ it and contribute to the off@@ ence of the perpetr@@ ators .
we have to report as long as abuse is no longer considered normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . prior to that , parts of the law had been modified , including a passage that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence .
opinions about the changes are diver@@ ging .
the passage concerning reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to re @-@ attack its victim .
however , the submission of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law is regarded as a big set@@ back .

independent media in Oman a year after the ban of a newspaper continues to attack attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked by a resolution of the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the om@@ anic authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n on account of their corruption in the sul@@ tan .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he served one year imprisonment .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and brought to trial , but later released again .
Oman has been reig@@ ning since 1970 by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after having aboli@@ shed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat .
since then , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , he has held the main offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , President of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the rule of the sul@@ tan is characterized by the persistent efforts of security forces , in particular the domestic secret service , restric@@ ting public fre@@ edoms , including freedom of the press , restric@@ ting human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists to intim@@ id@@ ate and det@@ ain .
the authorities systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to freely express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline .
the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , its closure and the arrest of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper which has been reported since its inc@@ eption in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on July 28 , 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , noted that an article was published in the newspaper on July 26 , 2016 with the title &quot; High @-@ ranking parties bind hands of justice . &quot;
in the report , government officials were accused of having put pressure on judges of the Supreme Court of Oman to susp@@ end a verdict in a her@@ edi@@ tary dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n dated July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind the hands of justice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the Editorial Board , was charged by the ISS before the Special Department and arrested on his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS took over the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is &apos;s arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and dis@@ semination of the newspaper in any way , including online , was prohibited from 9 August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trial of Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i took place in Mas@@ k@@ at on 26 September 2016 .
the Court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convic@@ ted of disrup@@ ting public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the pres@@ tige of the state . &quot;
in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a ban on publication and slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es of 3,000 US dollars ( $ 7@@ 800 ) , and a one @-@ year ban imposed on both journalists was imposed .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) , having been found guilty of using &quot; an information network to spread material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
a security deposit of $ 13@@ ,000 was fixed for Al @-@ Abr@@ i ( $ 13@@ ,000 ) and was released on 22 August 2016 before the judgment of the sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for a year and al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ k@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j remained in prison , where he served his one @-@ year sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also sum@@ mon@@ ed the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
despite the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper continues to face attacks by the om@@ anic government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order to extend the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed another order in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , with which the Minister asked for the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to re @-@ launch the publication of the newspaper .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which Oman has recently viol@@ ated press freedom .
other injuries include , for example , the closure of the site of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ at@@ as and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression arises that the om@@ anic authorities are still un@@ willing to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the authorities to :
1 . release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condi@@ tionally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have been able to exercise their right human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation measures , including arbit@@ ration .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organisation , the human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in adjacent states by promoting freedom of expression and association , and the right to assemble , support and provide protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with his agreement
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or even mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
there are two reasons why medical research is needed on site : on the one hand , many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent are missing in the supply of global healthcare .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria are far more serious in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for resear@@ ching these diseases by pharmaceutical companies is a major problem .
second , research carried out by African scholars themselves helps build their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
in the 1990s , he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just when the AIDS epide@@ mic was the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for studying in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home in order to support the Serbian health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( disc@@ laim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GM ) : what is your research topic ?
R@@ ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the Serbian national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I have just started a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
GM : what do you think are the most important current science topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed somewhere else .
this has to change , otherwise we will always remain recipients instead of being makers .
the solutions we get are often not well usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GV : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported in different ways .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , because funding and opportunities for development are better in other countries .
GM : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs much money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GM : what is the public opinion about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GM : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special scientific training , beginning at any age .
the social sciences , computer sciences , big data , exploration of space , healthcare ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly from this .
GM : can you describe the pro@@ s and cons of life as a scientist in Africa vis @-@ Ã  @-@ vis western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system that magazines are only accessible against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems around the world .
Frank Mor@@ ton has bred salmon in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ re Gor@@ geous , the first plant grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only by his own imagination and the question of how many sorts of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them further for breeding .
the patents were used not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties , such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves .
over the past few years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereals or cart@@ es . due to this trend , plant bree@@ ders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts for food security are concerned with the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of old tradition , Mor@@ ton is still breeding a salad , but he now needs longer because his work is further complicated by ever more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like lying in a river a b@@ oul@@ der that I have to p@@ addle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have to do it now , but it is a break with the tradition of breeding , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go too far on salads .
and if they stand up to court , no one can breed a new type of salad , because all the features are already patented . &quot; so he continues to do as good as possible and tries to breed those characteristics that he wants .
however , it is very careful and endeav@@ ours not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
it has also joined a movement that is becoming ever larger in the US and throughout the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman salads of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; greenhouse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; variety of the station . it is tested there whether plants can be grown in space . &quot; &quot; &quot;

it is no coinci@@ dence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT @-@ area and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source seed initiative ( initiative for open @-@ source seeds ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ righ@@ ted software .
it was created in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used permanently for plant bree@@ ders .
as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US bree@@ ders can commit themselves to freely use the seeds bred by them .
however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bree@@ ders only allow others who purchase their seeds to breed their own varieties , and not to su@@ ck it immediately - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant pat@@ ties .
dozens of bree@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
a glo@@ omy prospect
for the Emer@@ itus Professor at the University of Wisconsin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control of seed and the possibility of breeding new plants is important for food security and environmental protection .
seeds are said to play a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bree@@ ders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified plants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all types of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from organic farming or not . &quot; in order to reach our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seed , &quot; says he , and particip@@ ates in the ever @-@ increasing mer@@ gers in the global agri@@ business , as it is offered for example on farmers markets , should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without a seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source seed initiative are committed to ensuring that their seed continues to be freely available , as opposed to pat@@ enting seed and plant characteristics .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore increasingly available .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , director of O@@ ss@@ i , has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about one @-@ third of all the car@@ rot characteristics are protected as intellectual property , making it available for plant bree@@ ders either not at all or is difficult to use .
such estimates do not exist for other plants , but experts such as Lu@@ by suggest that mass @-@ grown plants such as wheat are pat@@ ent@@ eed in even bigger style than salad or car@@ rots .
a question of point of view
plants are bred in such a way that they have targeted characteristics - such by which their taste or colour improves to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bree@@ ders is ab@@ duc@@ ted by more and more patents . genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever before , as the changed conditions are much less pre@@ dict@@ ably due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ spokes@@ woman Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to recognis@@ es that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the United States Department of Agriculture , the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it contradic@@ ts the view that intellectual property would restrict other bree@@ ders , as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties encourage innovation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expi@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method .
such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but promotes it by providing more material and expertise to the public . &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees this differently : waiting for 20 years , until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovations .
and if one had to wait so long to be able to breed crops adapted to the changed environmental conditions , the struggle would have already been lost .
but the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a common good , and they should continue to stay : &quot; independent plant bree@@ ders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive for us .
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it will be impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in total , Mor@@ ton is interfer@@ ing with the concept of pat@@ enting plant characteristics : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really create the features themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plants form the plants themselves and as a bree@@ der we have no idea how plants do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a secret of nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Caro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the US state of Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i member of the Management Board , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; whoever breeds a variety also breeding its own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , for whose cultivation it is necessary to produce massive her@@ bi@@ cides , breeds this concept of agriculture in its varieties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to ) patents , most of the smaller seed companies can survive without patents - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case .
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mor@@ ton looks for salads in his breeding garden .

in addition , Mor@@ ton believes that bree@@ ders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks like I am stronger than companies who are pat@@ enting with my efforts to produce something new .
I constantly need new material for my catalog because I know that my competitors will sell my varieties for themselves in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent , one is protected from competition for 20 years , with what I think is quite simple . &quot; worldwide resonance
although the US seems to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the area of resources , implements an &quot; open source &quot; seed programme . to maintain the seed of traditional crops , the Centre operates with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Association Agreement is working on an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i commitment to bree@@ ders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( regulations for breeding differ from country to country , so the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot simply be one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able .
however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organised a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organizations and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the pat@@ enting of seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; programme for Open Source seed systems , explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for Open Source seed systems for which the official starting signal should be planned for the next year .
a merger of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit aid organization US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of eating - has published a report published by the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others , and believes that farmers have the opportunity to come to seed , exchange it and improve seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured .
the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a diverse , local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a connection that Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes that more people will soon be recognized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has paid attention to where and how something is grown , and seed systems hardly have played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest aims of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still block content on the internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of May 5th , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports on the above .
in August , the network published a statement on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ised for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights information remains true - in spite of this attack and the mo@@ cking of Egyptian law and the Constitution by the authorities who are supposed to defend the law and to give victims a voice . even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals , it has never been as important as now .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news site M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era network origin@@ ating from Qatar for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organization of the wave of web site closures to the victim . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ V@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada also has no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the dis@@ semination of columns and articles that he writes for websites and media not accessible in Egypt .
now the blog he set up to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government itself became the target of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider in which also Zi@@ adas blog is home , is still accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on student protests and took a video on how the police practiced physical violence against two students .
his articles revol@@ ve mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the government &apos;s blocking and reflecting what this means for him :
the blo@@ gs to lock is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blo@@ gs of blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) It has been possible for them to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege ; arrest , attempted murder , loading by the National Security Council , blocking blo@@ gs as well as any other web site for which I worked .
2 ) They proved that I didn &apos;t write for nothing . in other words , my words have influence , al@@ beit only to a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post items to circum@@ vent cens@@ orship .
but now , after they have locked it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the brave walk the way through to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August . this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and ET@@ IS@@ A@@ LA@@ T .
furthermore , Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) also documented the block@@ age of providers that were possible by b@@ yp@@ assing internet cens@@ orship and private surfing .
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday 12 June we noticed how the block@@ age of web pages that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer began .
such a practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content to which Egyptian users might have access .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation is additionally wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that cens@@ orship decisions are taken behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which it can proceed against these acts in court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants fight .

day after day newspapers in all of Brazil report with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motives .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves rob@@ bing pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 troops of the army , nav@@ y and air to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio achieved the highest level for 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least find the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; known for detailed reporting on violence in Rio on 16th August , published the Editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where she announced to set up a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the newspaper explained the motives for their decision like this :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . anything that happens from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio is published in the heading &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , explained that this decision was no cause for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ c in a country that does not recognize the war at all .
in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the newspaper writes :
we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distorted , can also be used to cover cru@@ el@@ ty of the police , which first sho@@ ots and then asks questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose purpose is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Ma@@ fia and its partners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; does the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harm more than it benefits ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , argued that violence was a &quot; war . &quot; according to her opinion this was a justification for the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to prosec@@ ute officials in the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and compl@@ ac@@ ent negl@@ ect of public service .
to remember : the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than just its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro is wrong : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the latest available data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ ats per federal state , Rio is on number 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is owned by Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , like Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for years .
these security policy measures included the founding of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose goal is to capture a fav@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police car and permanently station@@ ing a unit there .
in the beginning , this led to a decline of violent death cases . but after several years the U@@ PP has been increasingly under fire after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities that should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ Ã£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also draws serious consequences for the people .
for this demands the state to use means and ways that are typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civilian is an unbe@@ ar@@ able point in the landscape and becomes an object for coll@@ ateral damage and &quot; lost bul@@ lets . &quot;
going back or forth , the fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio continue to suffer .
a week ago , the police cleared the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : an or@@ ch@@ ard died as a result of shots that the police had fired from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besieg@@ ed Syrians learn to plant fung@@ i
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the following civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops .
according to Siege Watch , a joint initiative of the PA@@ X peace organization and the Syria Institute research institute , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege .
the Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly affected where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 prompted the lives of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition have been based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas outside Damascus have stood under siege , leading to local residents being dependent on locally produced food or tunnels and control points .
through years of block@@ ade traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian volunteers and ac@@ adem@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of Eastern Gh@@ out@@ as how they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the traditional food in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food is an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the right of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to AF@@ P , French news agency :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we chose to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years to introduce this project and expressed his relief that it now gains more and more awareness . &quot;
in order to collect money for the initiative , we can use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ mei@@ da .
it is planned to provide 125 families with knowledge about planting mushrooms , such as Dr. Lei@@ la zu Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ do until Monday 4th September 2017 .
the initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
due to the shortage of fuel locally produced fuels from plastic are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of mushroom seed from regions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before examining their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed fung@@ i everywhere in Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach the people mushroom breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : breaking the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
dis@@ semination of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc . ) for the production of new food .
creation of new jobs , especially for women working at home .
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities tied to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea throughout the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the siege will become visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in conflict areas and we can help mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Portuguese demand justice for victims of the 2017 fires &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many district capital cities in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of fires that were r@@ amp@@ ant in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two persons died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires between 15 and 16 October . this led to the government last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
bran@@ dies were also registered in the Gali@@ cia region of Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire breaks that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded by the fires .
according to the European forest monitoring system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite images , around 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness : there is no fire in 4 districts .
all of Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ yan ) October 15 , 2017
some of Twitter users shared pictures :

numerous videos are spread on the web and show images that allow better insights into what is happening :
the tragedy that is fores@@ eeable
the aim of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wonder@@ ed why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ Ã£o So@@ ver@@ al of the Con@@ federation of Far@@ mers in Portugal declared P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ co :
after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , streets and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did this nowhere : there are dozens of reports of open roads that were surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have happened again in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned .
a wide @-@ reaching proposal on the reform of the wh@@ ale , which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law allowing the construction activity in case the applicant had funds for self @-@ protection - that was an open back door , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ Ã£o Sor@@ val continued in the same article from the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of easily inflamm@@ able wood , spread like in a vi@@ cious circle , after fires of this kind .
these problems add to the fact that the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when residents searched for information or tried to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided information to the population , using the application f@@ og@@ os.@@ D. and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of the fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by Jo@@ Ã£o P@@ ina &apos;s developer to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade , and at this fat@@ eful weekend in October , it was crucial that the servers did not withstand the rush of the 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the site counted more than half a million hits .
even the founder asked for help :

the way from Afghanistan to a successful entrepren@@ eur

in one night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan by the Tali@@ ban began .
two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups who had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . Afghanistan has become a country of terror and despair .
exactly at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , sat together in G@@ haz@@ ni Province in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner .
even if his mother did not say it at that time , she knew that she would not see her son for a long time - maybe even more .
in the morning , the boy was supposed to break open .
his unc@@ le would fetch him and bring him to the bul@@ ls .

CC @-@ 2.0 of the industry
Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ habi faction dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been killed by the Tali@@ ban and many Haz@@ ara felt suddenly def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess .
the Tali@@ ban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan again .
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his low wages and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and drag@@ ged sacks with mortar , which were heavier than himself , in order to earn his livel@@ ihood .
back then , like today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really tough , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site , on which we also worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there were no services there and no heating . we hang@@ ed nylon in front of the open windows , so that we did not freeze at night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous over@@ ride on the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time A@@ shar@@ k was hom@@ eless , ran through the streets of Rome alone , fell asleep in parks and went to a church that distributed food to the needy twice a day .
it is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high immigration quot@@ as . it is true , however , that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers find in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers are accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; they are impro@@ vised equipment in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can then be admitted to a reception centre only if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - what can be drawn up for months after the asylum application has been registered .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation either depend on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street .
thus there was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ restra@@ ined fer@@ v@@ our helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
after several years of working in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af put his entire savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now subject to the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to in@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans are living in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on its way to other European countries .
in recent years some of Afgh@@ an companies have ar@@ isen , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his ori@@ ent Orient Experience where the wa@@ iters and kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes .
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari in Pad@@ ua opened the restaurant peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
but A@@ shar@@ af@@ s &apos;s goals go far beyond the Italian gastronomy business and retailers and aim to return to the country which he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where there is a risk , there are opportunities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af is also making plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can sell their crops on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end there are stability and prosperity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ eti@@ zen report : Egypt &apos;s draft laws enable the shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in prison .
he reported about the clearing of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the de@@ composition of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

the Egyptian parliament has reviewed a bill that fores@@ ees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook just after registering with a government authority .
users would have to register in order to be able to use the social networks within six months of the successful decision of the law on the authority &apos;s website indicating their full name and ID number .
anyone who missed this step could be sentenced to six months &apos; imprisonment or pen@@ alties for pen@@ alties .
the law , promoted by sixty members of parliament , is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another member of the Bundestag submitted a legislative proposal to introduce the tough@@ er pun@@ ish@@ ments for insul@@ ting the president or senior officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under Egyptian law , the insul@@ t of the president as well as state institutions is already pun@@ ish@@ able . however , under the law proposition , such a deed would be punished with prison sentences and fin@@ es , as legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law is passed , this may mean up to three years in prison for the condemned .
in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly in any case has been in je@@ op@@ ar@@ dy for many years .
a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photograph@@ ed Egyptian polic@@ emen while exercising violence against prot@@ esters who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting , like more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested in the same incident four years in prison for a court appointment .
his trial was recently postpon@@ ed to 20 May because the prison management , according to human rights groups , failed to bring the def@@ end@@ ants from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , pseu@@ do @-@ bur@@ dening of e.g. weapons possession , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iz@@ a was acqu@@ itted by the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for reporting on pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo .
the Court also reduced the punishment of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested during the aforementioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunisi@@ an activ@@ ist list@@ ens to le@@ aked documents
in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly heard for a le@@ aked action plan . said plan comes from the President of the Republic , who according to the plan explicitly supports a controversial draft bill that would ensure business@@ men and during the former regime dict@@ ated by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , provided that they return all un@@ lawful funds .
the document published on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at on April 21 , sheds light on how the presidential plans are made to support the bill .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia re@@ jects the nam@@ ing of his sources under the provision of Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an Press Code , which ensures journalists the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he appeared in the District Court of Tunis on May 09 as a witness in the case .
will China force the users of social media to present their identity ?
according to new regulations of the People &apos;s Republic of China Information Office , users of social media in China require approval before they write or share news in social media .
the rules also indicate that registration with full real name will be required .
analysts suspect that this will enable the elimination of anonymous comments in social networks within social networks . up to now , it is unclear how the authorities will apply these rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chinese citizens have proposed social media to sel@@ ectively en@@ force these rules in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and independence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ com@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat de@@ vis@@ es to register with the state government as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organizer of the dis@@ semination of information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this designation is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that organize the &quot; Publi@@ cation of Information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for removing content and comp@@ el them upon request for the execution of user data .
these websites are currently websites such as V@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ plat@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court decre@@ es Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ordered the blocking of Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia @-@ administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the declar@@ ations that Turkey endor@@ se the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communications admitted that the site was locked because they were &quot; a source of information that collabor@@ ated with groups in order to seek a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website . it is , among other things , China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
Britain cannot stop to sni@@ ff around
after this week &apos;s le@@ aked documents , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install the Backdoor , which dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications enterprises and intelligence services regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and civilian populations on the outside .
despite all this , the consultation runs until May 19 . reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior .
