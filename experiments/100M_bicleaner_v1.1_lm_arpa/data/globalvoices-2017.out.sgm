<seg id="1">Although I had visited the US since 2012 at least once a year, I would live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, dancing to American music, reading American authors and practising their sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, covered the murderous conspiracy of an oil-magnate, who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were interested in his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was trapped.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free to Method Man," "" "I was like the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona had only increased my admiration for the United States.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said, "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very fanatical love letter written about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then came Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">With his opinion, he never stops behind the mountain, as one says so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague, and publicly denies his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, African Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless people have responded to his statements and voted in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican primaries was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever reached.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigoted person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism programme that welcomes people from all over the world, a deeply devout person with whom I was able to talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Neither was Trumps worldview coincided with that of Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhada and I met with our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" playing in the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intolerance is also in stark contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fights the environment for a long time, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits the engagement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew delicacies, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot during my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump posted his way to the nominee Republican presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">It turned out, however, that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly White, gave the presidency to a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt towards non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The debate with the idea that people voted for trump because they either shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "perhaps it is unfair to designate the Trump-voters as" "" "racists" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify people, one of my friends said, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, voted for trump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, would they perhaps say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commentates on the cruel decision to lift up a man who looks down with contempt upon those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "whitelash" (note of the OB.): "revolving the whites against all other ethnic groups." the white and whiplash play, as the Great Van Jones, has just killed what America has made so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background one likes, America is everyone welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president twice the son of a Kenyanite, its history, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election of Donald Trumps, however, a huge portion of the white American gives this promise and says: to hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">All this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of word with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"" "" "" "Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" "" "Mr. Khan asked." ""</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "the crowd answered with a loud" "" "no!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"" "" "" "would Muslims have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "the crowd shouted." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they answered." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they shouted and their voices became louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "if someone who is not like you, would have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a unanimous and loud" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan closed with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, this is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country for which his son was pleased sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps Land, the message said.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan could find no place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What does the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca have in common with the children of the Paraguaan city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music played in both places has not only changed the lives of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular with tourists -but worlds apart from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now, the La banda de MÃºsica (music band) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults who has found a way to overcome poverty through their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drug abuse and gangs violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a chance meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare glimmer of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they get out of school they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">You always come laughing and playing with shiny eyes and play in the hustle you learn to play trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from trash</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometers south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura - a village located on top of the largest garbage dump of AsunciÃ³n in Paraguayan capital - play on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reconditioned instruments made of local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers under the direction of Favio ChÃ¡vez have begun to transform parts of waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate fiddle, viola, cellos, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums, all of which were made out of the trash.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article by the Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez, a local ecologist and musician of the children of Cateura, recalls at the beginning:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the trash. the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something he had never seen before: a violin made from waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is a whole orchestra playing on instruments made of recycled material and that is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentation named "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">Every year, the world generates approximately one billion tons of trash.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and team work can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically tells about international, practical solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">Republication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for the sharing of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa it was known then that this ship had already had illegal fishing in Liberia's waters before it sought the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were raised accordingly and little inclined to welcome a law breaker of this kind on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to blink one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused to" "", "remembers Benedict Kiilu, an executive employee of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team who discovered and persecuted the ship at that time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: he didn't manage to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Ultimately, it was also forced to pay $2 million in Liberia, as a result of looting the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 founded by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal Fisheries).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are besides Somalia and Madagascar the six countries that the prime ministers had driven out of their waters back then.</seg>
<seg id="108">They exchange information and help each other where it comes to illegal fishing, "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project provides technical support for FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to track down. therefore illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By the deliberate disregard of existing laws through which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing can harm ecosystems which have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also through the snail-empo, with the information between individual countries, these actions happen nowadays in real time, traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i is also very attentive to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea by satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to flag ships which are fishing in forbidden areas. such suspicious routes can also be discovered, such as those indicative that a ship charges its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can show whether the vessels involved have a fishing license, where they were on the move and, if possible, whether they have a criminal law.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such vessels in their ports on the basis of this information, meaning that ships cannot sell their cargo, and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then there are substantial financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worth financial support." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and that's what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, managing director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm campaigning for the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The previously mentioned platform was created to recover an estimated $20 million lost in revenue lost by the eight members of the HISH-i network each year because of illegal fishermen entering into East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, so the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world. among them also illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Among them are actions including sailing under false flag, counterfeit licensed papers, specification of fantasy names, fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non-complete control system," "" "says Long." "" "in the past, a ship was able to fish illegally and a country could say" "" "You may not run my harbour." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me" "" "and this legal loophole is trying to close FISH-i now." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">The closed front has so far been working.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has revealed criminal networks that had spread falsified licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used multiple fraudulent identities and it has persecuted and found fleeting ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its collaboration with INTERPOL, the international authorities for the fight against crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspect vessels more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, also helps to track down the illegal vessels that love to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "illegal fishermen use very ingenious techniques to hide their activities and their position." "" "Duncan Copeland, Chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fisheries data and provides technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland is therefore helping build a system that connects different levels of information. it is intended to help FISH-i find criminal acts with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations actually influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes this.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has jointly opened the platform Global Fishing Watch together with Google and the Oceana marine conservation organization: a platform that provides satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by means of the position of each trackable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbours to get a better picture of who does what where - that makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and join their resources for investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on a global scale." "" "ew charitable trusts have a similar project to allow a global system to prosecute ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are indications that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships which had previously been fishing without a license and had little to reckon with consequences now know that they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i are now seeing a 33% increase in fisheries sales since fishing boats are buying more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i had helped Somalia detect Greko 1, the inspectors were there on board trawl nets, whose use is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "we have become a study object." "" "in West Africa several hundred million dollars annually disappear by illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">In 2015, six countries joined forces, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they too are fighting illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i. "Safety is the goal of developing even more of such initiatives and structures in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member country Somalia was able to report its first big triumph: in October, it represented Greko 1, a ship sailing under a false flag. and not only was the ship on the move without a license and were used towing nets that are now banned.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also imbued into forbidden waters reserved for Fischer from Somalia." "" "taking measures against Greko 1 set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing," "" "said Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time the evidence that such a special collaborative approach to protecting the oceans really works across the world sea.

<seg id="153">The movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are considered to protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the removal of President NicolÃ¡s Maduro.</seg>
<seg id="155">This picture of MarÃ­a Alejandra Mora shows a close-up of the demonstration in Maracaibo in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the Venezuelan government rejected the opposition's request to a referendum on the term of office, the Venezuelans, in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into emptiness, reacted in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: Venezuela's refunding) both these demonstrations and arguments can be found for and against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate will also be held in other parts of the country - among others in the lowland area of Barinas, in the Andean regions of MÃ©rida and TÃ¡chira, in the centrally located federal Parliament Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The country's political and economic situation is worsening continuously, which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezuelans by an acute lack of food and medicines.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the chance for a fundamental change in the impeachment of the current President NicolÃ¡s Maduro, but ultimately the reluctance of a new election was blocked by official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne DÃ­az, Contributors at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises in her latest article the context of the governmental decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">In the context of the social, political and economic crisis, in which the rate of inflation and violence is one of the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% at the end of the year) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine exists, the referendum was regarded as the only way to give the country a chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance of Mesa de la Unidad DemocrÃ¡tica or shortly MUD (about: round table of the Democratic Unit), in which the opposition parties and political groups joined forces, urged the demonstrators to join a mass rally to support the National Assembly, which after the elections of 2015 was planned for the majority of representatives of the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter as follows:</seg>

<seg id="176">On Twitter, images that talk about arguments, as well as reports of oppression and mistreatment, are piling up on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="177">Particularly large waves hit the news of police repression in the centrally located town of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">There the demonstrators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves according to their own statements in front of the police and armed advocates of the government.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they could safely leave the cathedral, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some demonstrators tried to stop the police forces, including this woman in the Andean state TÃ¡chira:</seg>
<seg id="181">The women in TÃ¡chira don't wear skirts, because otherwise you could see something that many National Guards do not have!</seg>
<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic already accounts for the amount of suppression per day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship has suppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the demand for an impeachment procedure - it was now proved in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview by Alejo GÃ³mez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 on DÃ­a a DÃ­a, an Argentinean news site.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to take a look at the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentine city of CÃ³rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As a grown-up man, Quijano now testified against his father as part of the great La Perla Ribera trial in the province of Cordoba.</seg>
<seg id="201">The trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, investigates crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">He started to wear the same name as his father until the brutal military operations in the La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years, he kept the family secret for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I believed that was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child of 15 years, one does not realize that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time, I couldn't realize that my father was a thief, torturer and killer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was a gendarmerie. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was the deputy commander of the Secret Service Department 141 in prison La Perla from 1976 to 1978.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>

<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor, who is accused of kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who, over the years, realized the extent of the atrocities he had witnessed as a boy, and who testified before a federal court against his own father.</seg>

<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall. there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">All called it "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and invited me to identify my friend.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are an asshole, you have been friends with one of the ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">Be careful not to kidnap you one day and then I'll have to save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The acronym ERP is for EjÃ©rcito Revolucionario del Pueblo, - Revolutionary People's Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers "party of Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="223">That is why he forbade me to go back to the sports hall. a few days later he took me to work at the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me I would become a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine. for so my father had educated me.</seg>
<seg id="226">At the base of the military base, I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all possible documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, just everything.</seg>

<seg id="230">My father took me a total of four times to La Perla - all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">At the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he ordered me to get off. he led me to a barracks, in the cars, furniture, TV, fridges - just anything possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a small packet wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big lumps of silver inside.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen objects were parked and stopped me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured there.</seg>
<seg id="238">I saw in, and saw a couch in which men were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they fastened it to the end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who was lying there.</seg>

<seg id="348">"" "on a sign the Japanese word" "" "older drivers" "" "means wrongly - maybe also with malicious hulls & # 8212; as" "" "terrible motorists" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was from 1 to 20 September on electronic displays in the entrance area and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Review Joshua Levine's original photos, which has been widely shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto-based daily Kyoto Shimbun wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "" "" "how could it come to such an English translation?" ""</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"" "this is an insult to older people and in an international city as Kyoto is simply unacceptable," "" "Holmes said." ""</seg>
<seg id="356">The flawed English translation was first removed. the term "terrible drivers" (German: "terrible motorists") was later replaced by the more appropriate, although grammatically not quite correct name "elder drivers" (German: "older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The police of Prefecture Kyoto apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the mistake was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger told us about the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we are sincerely sorry that older people felt insulted by inadequate correction (translation) on our part," "" "said the police." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">Japanese online news service J-Cast News dealt with the phenomenon of the "terrible" elderly drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"" "the word" "" "terrible" "" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of elderly drivers involved in accidents is quite a matter of concern." ""</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto Prefecture, for example, in 2005 1,941 were caused by a total of 19,460 deaths of seniors. this corresponds to a share of 10%.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To translate, one needs two important skills: passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and to provide active language skills in order to transmit it to the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires an active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction is that translators in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ English as their native language to make translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost reasons, or the relatively small number of English native speakers learning Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">However, some companies that do not have foreign employees can still make translations in-house. then the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is considered to be the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The worsening and puzzling phrases, which arise through machine translation, show that this technique cannot substitute a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling prints that often adorn T-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery, but by large corporations or by government that have the means to ensure higher standards, one can expect more meticulous translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully make use of a more serious source of its translations.</seg>

<seg id="391">Main page of the "Navegar con Libertad" portal (Free Surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, 7 April, Venezuelan Internet users announced that they would have no access to the online channel Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the internet presentations of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online broadcasters also carried out recordings of the protests in Caracas, organized by opposition groups opposed to the government NicolÃ¡s Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">Protests began at the beginning of April, after the Supreme Court disbanded the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and writer at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroute. he pointed out that the connection was caught and recommended the users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Censorship: enables your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet pages of Venezuelan providers have been blocked again.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the page of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular among Venezuelans with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media has been hesitant in reporting on protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission was threatening to punish them with fines and closures if they would continue to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw this as an "call to violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national television channels, I registered at @ vivoplaynet again.</seg>
<seg id="403">It is amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO, VESinintro confirmed later that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible by blocking the domain name system (DNS), but also two more online transmitters. this also applies to the website where the National Assembly takes its sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Earlier investigations of the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique by which the DNS servers respond accurately to certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a Web site is blocked by the DNS, the server responds incorrectly or denies the request when calling such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS block: @ eledoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">On VPITV, a third locked channel, the transmission was stopped on Thursday, April 6, when the VPITV cameraman Elvis Flores, who carried the protests in Caracas live, was arrested.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went to broadcast again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it has also been reported that the government regulates Internet connections, making it more and more difficult for Venezuelan access to multimedia reporting on current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride in her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "the one from which something has become," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she became ten years old, she began to work as a Criadita for the family. as Criaditas, in Paraguay the more than 46.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money transfers their underage son or their underage daughter to another, more rich family. in exchange, the child receives food, training and a roof above the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">What is not mentioned, however, is that the children have to pay a number of days of housework, which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be abolished.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice called Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls affected by the practice of the Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name things by name, because the feeling of gratitude inoculated to the Criadita in general guarantees still silence.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, there is the family that her daughter finds in believing that she can complete her training, improve her position in society and "make something out of herself" to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family that receives the girl with her and justifies its exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and perhaps even starved.</seg>

<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was in the household of the former military associate, TomÃ¡s Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Population Register.</seg>
<seg id="439">MarÃ­n lived with them in their house in VaquerÃ­a, a small village with only 3.000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital AsunciÃ³n.</seg>
<seg id="440">End of January 2016 Ferreira entered MarÃ­n as long as she suffered lethal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the deeply rooted practice of Criadazgo responsible for the death of the girl in the Paraguayan society.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozens of people came together to protest marches and demanded that there be "no further Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely used in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"" "" "" "in Paraguay more cows are registered than children," "" "Tina Alvarenga complained." ""</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers it is much easier to violate the rights of children unpunished.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control, under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbors of the married couple and almost 60 civil society organisations called for a prompt investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want TomÃ¡s Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes to court, the case of Carolina MarÃ­n could be trendsetting - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Criadazgo comes to court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Criaditas are not only exploited as labour, they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Jobbik party, in which her father worked, had to enroll in bankruptcy and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to work and began to sell sweets on the street or on the market to earn money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital AsunciÃ³n as Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="460">Alvarenga worked in the home of her employer between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to divide the time in such a way that she still had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She got up every morning at five o'clock and prepared breakfast for her employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">On Fridays, for example, she cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was over, she went back home and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The more she was finished with learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but also didn't have unlimited food. "I was allowed to get more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge," she recalls.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well-equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizers of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party, who belonged to the opposition during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power between 1954 and 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">On some evenings the landlord Alvarenga forced to stand beside him and read Editorials from opposition newspapers such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">He tried to convince them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the dictator's regime.</seg>
<seg id="471">He kept them intelligent, but did not stay with her. "the host had found someone who listened while he talked about politics," she says.</seg>
<seg id="472">"they often didn't allow me to visit my family because they were of the opinion that I would learn" bad habits "there again." this meant that Alvarenga, who belongs to the indigenous group of the GuaranÃ­, would speak at home again her mother tongue GuaranÃ­.</seg>
<seg id="473">Their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made possible for them.</seg>
<seg id="474">However, she was fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them with their hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">In school, Alvarenga was also discriminated against. "one thing that is almost never spoken is bullying and harassment exposed to Criadita when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anyone home. I had no friends in school or neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, in the time where friendships arise, I felt particularly clear that I was not a member of any group.</seg>

<seg id="501">Published under Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">"" "sixty Egyptian parliamentarians have recently agreed to draft a bill on" "" "the regulations on the use and use of social networks" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="503">When adopted by Parliament, users of social media in Egypt must register with a government agency in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="504">"" "" "" "on the basis of the law, a job would be set up that is mandated to grant citizens permission to use social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months of acceptance of the law, users must register on the site with their correct names and identity card numbers in order to be able to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If this fails to do so, it could have a sentence of up to six months in jail or a fine.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill comprising six paragraphs and curses in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent defines social media as "any application that runs and is used across the Internet to communicate with others by means of voice, video surveillance and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities are supposed to impose the registration. unclear is also how they should make up those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to guarantee regulation at the level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattar, MP and promoter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users received a username and password from the telecommunications ministry to get through the firewall that blocks Facebook. "</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt is planning to build a firewall at national level around Facebook. it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it has not been known until now that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on site are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research technologist (in German "leading research technologists") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German "Egyptian initiative for personal rights"), told Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I strongly dispute the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things related to technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion, they imagine that as they violently control physical public and private spaces it could be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I take them seriously, it means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who apply or not. and that is a crazy system to monitor people's activities and also to bring them into a judicial process.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">"" "" "" "in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed under the Parliament's legislative and constitutional committees before it goes to the plenary debate." ""</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not, the draft is in line with a pro-military way of thinking in parliament, in whose sense the control will be maximized and ensured that no different narration is present on the image surface, "says Raoof.</seg>
<seg id="520">Last year, the MP Tamer El-Shahawy proposed a bill against cyber crime in which a life sentence imposed on those who were found guilty of "threatening public order" and "to protest."</seg>

<seg id="525">High up in the mountains of the Kurdistan Region in the north-east of Iraq, the animal protector Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the non-governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working to protect the ghostly Persian leopards.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subtype of the larger family of leopards, who wander through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera Pardus saxicolor). altogether there are between 800 and 1.000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are endangered due to poaching, loss and fragmentation of their habitat and since they find less and less loot.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">As Raza shows in the video, "the Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem depends also on the fact that a big predator is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard indeed in the wild is low and goes against zero. when the team in the video determines that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a biologist, Raza passionately shows a different side of her country, which consists not only of war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies on wild animals and in the educational programmes of Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>
<seg id="532">Since 2013, she has also been a member of the IUCN / SSC Cat Specialist Group and is committed to providing protection zones for wildlife in the Kurdistan region.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School on Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by the tsunami on 11 March 2011 and still the region is occupied with reconstruction.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, Kahoku Shimpo, responsible for North East Japan, documented the progress achieved over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple disaster" in March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atomic accident in Fukushima caused the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in Miyagi Prefecture. Miyagi Prefecture was an etectable prefectures in Japan's Northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring counties Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuate, because the tsunami had left whole coastal cities disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition to that, Fukushima Prefecture experienced a nuclear accident, already because of that, 160,000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows, from a local point of view, what progress was achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of the local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese reconstruction and survey results of those concerned themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement buildings were completed (for example, in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate) in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was able to record the biggest success among the three prefectures, where 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima holds the final light at 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">Nevertheless, even six years after the catastrophe, one strives to relocate evacuation of temporary shelters (for example, to casetsu juutaku) into final replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple disaster, nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in temporary shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate still lived in such dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the villagers from Fukushima were still living in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful in this area. more than 75 percent of the evacuation, which came after the disaster in temporary homes, was resettled into final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the number here is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools, affected by misfortune, opened their doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the three prefectures schools.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 per cent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are in operation again, only 30 percent of fisheries have resumed their operations in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the atomic accident have affected agricultural land extensively in the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land, where only 66 per cent of the farmland in Iwate and less than 50 per cent destroyed farmland in Fukushima can be reused.</seg>
<seg id="565">"" "it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of land destroyed by Fukushima are located in the" "" "nuclear barrier zone" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but also here Fukushima remains far off.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are again 90 per cent on the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only show 75 percent here.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal dwellers, it is more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to establish a general picture, the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuates. she asked her about the state of reconstruction and also how her feeling was changed over the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In its introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents took measures to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents found that still not enough in terms of catastrophes prevention was done.</seg>
<seg id="575">What it means to those who had to be evacuated from Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its edition on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the Evacuates from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had not only witnessed the tremendous earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture was also witness to the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160,000 Evacuates from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, were resettled in permanent replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">According to the State of 2017, there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside of their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">Most of the evacuation centers in the disaster areas are older than 50 years old. it is well known that the efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima will have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When you meet people from other countries who speak a different language, the differences seem to be greater than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often recognizes that one more connects than it seems at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important, as they challenge our prejudices, expand our prospects and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">As a result of Into the Deep, the Global Voices podcast, let's take a look at these global connections. in our Into the Deep podcast, we treat issues that often attract less attention when reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members, who remember a moment when they have felt very strongly connected with someone beyond language and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veronika Krikoni talks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Tori Egherman explains how a hike has consolidated its affection for Iranian culture; Violeta Camarasa speaks about the time when she worked with people from all over the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences he gathered in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Ãlvaro Reynoso nearly hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba closed doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, who is located in the Western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is commonly known as el Central - at Spanish sugar mill - no notwithstanding that there is no significant sugar harvesting on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralysed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After succeeding, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commuted daily to the factories still grinding.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran who is open every day at 4: 00 a.m., the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region that are in operation again after a long inactive period because they have been preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene recalls exactly that in MaÃ±alich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry has already withstood the plagues, the fall of socialism, the low market prices, inefficiency, bad administration decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are no longer a news anymore.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the community saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane mills were technically outdated and scarcely competitive for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugars must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organization.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the export of raw sugar would generate around 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will certainly go into history," "" "that was the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro in his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the shutdown of a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people received their full salary for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez has worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">"" "if Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about closing the factory, the word he repeats the most is" "" "scam" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are of the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order to preserve the place, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first closing year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially recorded documents which differ only with regard to the parts that would be removed, the addressee and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was postponed and the letters came more and more frequently.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the factory shut down for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in use," he assures.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years old, waits for retirement in another plant, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>

<seg id="692">Youth of the First Nations communities across Canada are concerned with topics that are important to them. they do so by hip-hop, thanks to a series of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan Tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the pedagogue David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then with the Cree Hip-Hop-Group The Northstars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop reflects the young participants in talks like "cultural identity, language, confrontation, love, self-acceptance" or whatever comes to mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in the U.S. state Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitbukalum First Nation in British Columbia tells, for example, the history of Highway 16, also called 'Highway of tears', a street section in Western Canada, where almost two dozen usually indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely not elucidated.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey the importance of the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the teenagers do not always speak native languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song, that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly of Northstars Hip-Hop-Group, who gave them a verse in the dialect of Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the verse is available in transcription, as well as a translation into English translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day you will hear our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because as a youth we have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">This is how they can grow and move forward as well as our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they meant to the Creator.</seg>
<seg id="713">In the comments section, the reader and advocate of Cree-language Kevin Brousseau also makes a contribution and adds the verse in syllabus (which is also published on his blog and published here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see almost every restaurant plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="719">In order to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, near the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (also, the "Plastic Models of the Courts") are exhibited by each dish that is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers look at these plastic dishes and decide whether they want to enter the restaurant or move on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">The Tokyo-Ga film maker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago in the Tokyo district of Kappabashi.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them anymore. however, a new trend now turns them into striking cell phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">With Naver Matome, the blogger itinii published series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sales: new mobile phones decorated with plastic ribbons, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial food were turned into kitschy collection objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin refrigerator magnets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food orders is becoming more and more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, an imperial-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was turned into a cell phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple holding your cell phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the Comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some cell phone stands and mobile designers allow you to make your own artwork. in this case, ikura, or salmon roe, is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there anyone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile with laughing cheats?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I'll be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take on a lesser appetizing form to surprise colleagues or family members.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melted ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also paddy balls (Onigiri), earrings and cellulose strips made of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">For more skurry plastic dishes, you can look at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag # 2.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, dedicated to supplying the restaurant industry. as for example with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the notorious "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the missing and killed regularly appear only in statistics. however, these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">The reporting on drugs bosses such as El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, the head of the Sinaloa cartel, completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident hardly anyone looks at the bereaved or the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">There are behind every body, behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never heal.</seg>
<seg id="753">Therefore, the Mexican news portal Animal PolÃ­tico has launched the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "live with the trafficking of drugs"), which will give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were in the struggle between the law enforcement authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico specifies the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime lets us not only fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when businesses close, because they are threatened by drug dealers, and so many kilometres have to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The Pain of the Victims</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "a video titled" "" "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" "" "(German:" "" "how fear changes life" "" ") tells exactly these stories." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches for secret graves after his son every weekend.</seg>

<seg id="774">"" "" "" "we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the conflict, the fragility and the leadership of the international community." ""</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter in what form it appears:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have known illness and sensation journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I visit newspaper kiosks every day and see the front pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from experts from experts.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of my composure.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as though I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this to be normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug traffickers) when he is big. and it's not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic deeds" of the offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something like that happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the inaction of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified by the fact that they were" "" "watered" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to persuade them to remain spared from such tragedies when they are not moving and silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "Four months of blackmail in the main city district: how a family with threats was plundered." in this she describes how an armed detective month spent money from her business until she had not only destroyed the business, but also tore her family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your entire life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain never passes, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We will contact you only if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will kidnap or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">In these awful days I wondered if weeping would dissolve my deep-rooted emotions, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to cry. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the article" "" "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: a Generation of Violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man killed by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like any other boy of his age, whose parents care for her.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a orphan and he says he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, make potatoes, make tortillas warm and make "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells about the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant in comparison to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years earlier when he was only a few blocks away from his home, seeing the bloody body of his father who was shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 as a violation of organised crime and the struggle against the existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">2008, 2009 and 2010 JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world based on the number of murders according to the Government of Public Security and the Government of the Government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the prosecution weighed 3103 murders. this corresponds to 8.5 murders per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines. but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal PolÃ­tico has launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose objective is to portray the complex information behind the failed conflict against drug trade, which has tormented the country over the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="818">The check is important at a moment when it comes to picking up a rumor or exposing a falsification.</seg>
<seg id="819">But what is the year after something has emerged the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to persist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let's take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first release, it has been widely used to portray tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of image and event - "false description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is abundant diligent reporting on events occurring in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tank truck traversed the town of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilted around and exploded.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second-largest country had been neglected for years and devastated. the streets in the region became dangerous paths full of potholes that were difficult to drive.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tank truck fell victim to it.</seg>
<seg id="828">Local authorities described a fireball that enveloped dozens of houses including a movie theater that was full of people looking at the football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses burned and charred corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned for indentiality.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture titled "That's Nigeria." from the Imgur user Mystical Monkey, 12 January 2015.Several photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charred bodies that are lined up on the floor while people look at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo was edited several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and wrongly attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, the Boko Haram fighters attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses drastically reported atrocities from which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and corpses lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one left to count corpses," "" "said one of the inhabitants of Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many had been dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images the following time could be depicted.</seg>
<seg id="844">The attack was also unsolved, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt of Boko Haram to win country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerged from the DR Congo, as it was falsely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of abortions; Africa Check has documented access to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases, the picture was presented as a receipt for mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further, personal commentaries such as this example falsely link the image from DR Congo with sources of mass media to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture of Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a blitzkrieg, published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee were beaten, rape and several dead, some through burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported of the violence against Rohingya, posts like the following appeared, which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi-Arab news website, falsely claimed that President Myanmar's Thein has said that monks and politicians have participated in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from DR Congo to illustrate this information.</seg>
<seg id="857">The original contribution, which was last accessed on 26 April 2017, can be viewed here.</seg>
<seg id="858">Other news organizations, who called AFP as their source, also falsely attributed Thein to this statement, but had not brought the picture out of the DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="859">The worldwide range of false information</seg>
<seg id="860">Traces of these false decousions date back to 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="861">With the help of an inverted image search, you can see how far information can cross borders.</seg>
<seg id="862">An inverted image search with the search engine TinEye has found 344 pictures under 18.8 billion images (as of May 3, 2017), which are very similar to the mentioned image of the DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="863">They come from a mix of private sites, social media platforms and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages, such as English, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, German, Greek and Portuguese.</seg>

<seg id="902">Malaysia offers two extreme examples of abusive use of the image from DR Congo, on the one hand a tweet, expressing sympathy towards the Nigerian massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blogger to delightfully investigate the claims that Rohingya are being used.</seg>

<seg id="905">This rectification, which has been published exclusively in English, also includes references to fake images of scents used by Hate Speech and used by extremist groups to explain that Muslims kill Buddhists and vice versa (which is often spread by burmesan nationalists).</seg>
<seg id="906">Russia, 2012. "angiography of a speculation?" (Christianophobia or political provocation?).</seg>
<seg id="907">This post, directed to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church, makes it clear that the image of the DR Congo is NOT Muslims who kill Christians.</seg>
<seg id="908">Saudi Arabia, 2012 / 2014.</seg>
<seg id="909">This news page falsely claimed that the President of Myanmar has admitted Thein Sein in 2012, that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Rohingya Muslims and brought the story together with the picture from Sange.</seg>
<seg id="910">The article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture is still included in it.</seg>
<seg id="911">Spain, 2015 / 2016.</seg>
<seg id="912">This article from 2014 about students who had been killed by the Boko Haram published by the news-page AnÃ¡lisis Digital, which is now deleted from the Catholic Church, has expressly declared that the picture does not originate from the killings, but it claims that it represents a "similar" jihadist attack.</seg>
<seg id="913">When the picture was circulated later in connection with the Boko Haram massacre of 2015, the paper El Pais tried to refute that there would be connections to Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="914">Turkey, 2015. "# NijeryaYanovyorfertiliyaUyuy" (Nigeria is burning, the world is sleeping).</seg>
<seg id="915">The picture of the DR Congo emerged, marked with this Twitter hashtag, and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the massacre of Boko Haram 2015 and the attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="916">They wanted to achieve that their communities would pay greater attention to those events suspected in the name of Islam.</seg>
<seg id="917">United States, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was weathered as evidence of the Boko Haram massacre in 2015 (and more than 9,300 times retched), but the messages related to it were not taken up in any religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the goal was to focus attention on the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media reporting in comparison to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Hebdo.</seg>
<seg id="920">Vietnam (portuguese), 2014.</seg>
<seg id="921">After a message allegedly written by a "father Juan Carlos Martos" about the Nigerian massacre, there were discussion forums like this in Vietnamese, declaring that it was false.</seg>
<seg id="922">From the message contained in the image of the DR Congo, the organization of the Claretine missionaries and Father Juan Carlos Martos have distanced themselves.</seg>
<seg id="923">There are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="924">Other accounts, aggregators and sites in the following countries (on the folder in grey) also reject TinEye, but are no longer fully traceable: Czech Republic, Australia, India, Peru, the Netherlands, Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, Azerbaijan, Japan and possibly China.</seg>
<seg id="925">(data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the Webcrawler and occasionally they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Rohingya Muslims.)</seg>
<seg id="926">In all these cases, which only appeared clearly after the original publication of 2010, the picture may eventually have a correct description, but the original contribution is not available or accessible.</seg>
<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (frames) that go through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used for greater discussions on silence in connection with the murders of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the murders of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is underrated compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question, however, is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">"" "" "" "with social media, there are tens of people who unintentionally participate in trampling the water around a tragedy." ""</seg>
<seg id="934">Does this mood of false and false information suggest that actual atrocities are untrue and does it decorate the real horror of what has actually happened in DR Congo, Nigeria and in Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The dissemination of violent images has already been extensively debated (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that withholding images of a refusal to recognise the tragedy. sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images are desensitizing readers and spectators and taking the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which investigates how violent media seem to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be used detached from the context or completely improper kind.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, each investigation of incorrect write-ups should also take into account how internationally they can be.</seg>

<seg id="943">Photo by Andy Simmons uses according to CC BY-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e. g. uninsurable) strives to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not at all translated.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words exist in each language: they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well-known today (like the famous Portuguese Saudi) and others deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish Sobretesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all stubbornly resist any attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or phrase is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context is required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected in an online list for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and linguist of "unTranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">For example, in the blog you can find words from the Mwotlap language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"" "" "" "vakasteglok" "" "- strive for your parents in recognition of how you have been concerned about you in your younger years." ""</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The comfort or laziness you feel after being warmed in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog About:</seg>
<seg id="956">They unveil other cultures, reveal other thoughts and arouse our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this page want to publish more of these "insurmountable" words and show how different, valuable and impressive are these small languages.</seg>
<seg id="958">Speakers of the "Treasure Languages," which are highly appreciated by untranslatable, are invited to upload their favourite destinations here.</seg>

<seg id="969">How Sri Lanka deals with the worst flooding disaster of the decade</seg>
<seg id="970">The island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flooding and landslide disaster in this decade.</seg>
<seg id="971">Triggered by the monsoon who normally uses the end of May, the rivers Kalu, Kelani, Gin, Nilwala and Attanagalu Oya have come across the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country.</seg>
<seg id="972">Following an opinion from the Sri Lankan catastrophe centre on 28 May 2017, 126 people were killed and scarcely hundreds of people are missing because of the floods and mud waves.</seg>
<seg id="973">More than 400,000 people have been affected since last Friday (26 May) and about 100,000 people have been brought to 304 shelters.</seg>
<seg id="974">The rain falls on Saturday (May 27), and the water levels in some areas decreased slowly.</seg>
<seg id="975">Health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still inaccessible areas.</seg>
<seg id="976">The following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flooding catastrophe:</seg>
<seg id="977">Flooding in Tawalama town with water levels of up to 7.5 meters. Twitter users such as Azzam Ameen and Sri Lanka Tweet regularly provide updates on flood situations.</seg>
<seg id="978">Many use the hashtag # FloodSL to monitor the extent of the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="979">Sri Lanka's deadly floods are worsening the crisis of the Dengue, Save the Children warns when further rainfalls are already on their way.</seg>
<seg id="980">This morning the Neluwa Bus stood in the high water, water level up to 6 meters. village of Moragoda near Galle also flooded because of the water pegels of the Morogoda Ela.</seg>
<seg id="981">The Air Force provided five aircraft for rescue operations and another five are ready for the transport of emergency supplies for the residents included in their flooded villages.</seg>
<seg id="982">Various organisations and startups are also ready to help.</seg>
<seg id="983">Facebook pages like Help Flood Victims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Disaster Relief - Information Desk- Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian aid.</seg>
<seg id="984">If any search and rescue teams require drones for their operations, please call 0774844639.</seg>
<seg id="985">For those who want to donate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -</seg>

<seg id="987">Please call today number 0777449729 or 0777843841 if you need help in this area.</seg>
<seg id="988">The taxi-call-app PickMe (Sri Lanka) asks anxious people to share their location data with the help of the app, so that the catastrophe centre is informed.</seg>
<seg id="989">Last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Roanu, PickMe introduced a "flood control" button which allowed users to call a vehicle for pick-up assistance and donations. they were then forwarded to the Sri Lankan Red Cross for free.</seg>
<seg id="990">They also introduced a "SOS" button, which resulted in more than a thousand inquiries and 150 successful boat rescue operations caused by floods and landslides.</seg>
<seg id="991">The united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka, where several social media platforms are fully exploited, provide security and support for residents in need.</seg>
<seg id="992">This has prevented the loss of other human lives, whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to the restoration of normality.</seg>

<seg id="1000">We are in a sea of umbrellas and people, some hold the iconic image of a woman with a head cloth high, bound from an American flag, others skew slogans against anti-Islam hostility.</seg>
<seg id="1001">"" "my friend looked at me and said," "" "These things don't concern you, isn't it?" "" "why, because I am not Muslims?" "" "I ask." ""</seg>
<seg id="1002">I have already led this conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1003">People with whom I work or people who know me for years separate me - the Sahar they know - from the widespread concept of "Muslims" that has built up in their imagination.</seg>
<seg id="1004">They dislike me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We don't all look the same.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practice our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves with being Muslim in different ways. but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer.</seg>
<seg id="1009">This drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims do not fit in there, they will be discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1010">To be demollimated</seg>
<seg id="1011">I don't stand alone.</seg>
<seg id="1012">This has even happened to the poet, whose poetry is best sold in America: Rumi.</seg>
<seg id="1013">Which pictures come to mind when you think of him?</seg>
<seg id="1014">Love?</seg>
<seg id="1015">Peace? peace?</seg>
<seg id="1016">When Jalaluddin Rumi was as old as I am now, he was an Orthodox Muslim preacher and scholar.</seg>
<seg id="1017">Islam, the Qur'an and Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry until the day he died.</seg>
<seg id="1018">But in the Western concept, the religion of Rumis was extinguished, as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1019">This deleting makes a large part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world.</seg>
<seg id="1020">Another is in the reductionist paintings of Muslims who have been colonizing Western books for centuries.</seg>
<seg id="1021">This enticing imagery is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save.</seg>
<seg id="1022">In the 1970s, the groundbreaking Palestinian scientist Edward Said disintegrated the story behind these images.</seg>
<seg id="1023">But these pictures still stand out today.</seg>
<seg id="1024">Our politicians, the news industry and Hollywood continue to understand them.</seg>
<seg id="1025">I have been working in the news industry for thirteen years and I have seen how these powerful, erroneous narratives dominate our news feeds.</seg>
<seg id="1026">This narrative overshadowed the reality that over the past three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries, while the US won't even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1027">This narrative fails to recognise that if French, Muslim women are prevented from wearing their headscarf in public buildings and Saudi, Muslim women by their government are forced to cover their entire body, these are both sides of the same coin.</seg>
<seg id="1028">"" "a powerful group exercises its" "" "control" "" "on the" "" "other" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1029">This strong narrative weakens Muslim women who lead movements for change.</seg>
<seg id="1030">It looks beyond the fact that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Africans who had been brought here with slave vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1031">It deletes the existence of queer Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This narrative has occupied our collective imagination such deep and flawed that often Sikh men and children become the target of anti-Muslim attacks and harassment.</seg>
<seg id="1033">Because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them, Islamophobia is not just fear of Islam, religion, but fear of the "other."</seg>
<seg id="1034">Of the 1.7 billion people</seg>
<seg id="1035">In the news industry, we do more than just stories based on facts.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Or on alternative facts.</seg>
<seg id="1037">We also create narratives which help us to understand the world.</seg>
<seg id="1038">And my industry has failed to capture the narrative of 1.7 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="1039">"" "and we have failed here, where seven million Muslims make up the" "" "diverse" "" "religious group in America." ""</seg>

<seg id="1052">These lies are produced on the ongoing tape by a well-lubricated anti-theft machine with finders, think tanks and false information experts who have manipulated our already erroneous image of what a Muslim is; or what Islam is, have manipulated.</seg>

<seg id="1073">To be Muslim is to speak the prayers she had told me to speak when I have a bad day.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Being Muslim is how she taught me to refer to God: Allah Mian, what God means, my only Lord.</seg>
<seg id="1075">For a people that, for centuries, has been colonized by an "Empire" that has established a company called Honorable Britian Eastern Line Company, it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord.</seg>

<seg id="1135">Storytelling, by Flickr-user Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to get in touch with someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), telling stories in their original language is a possible answer to them.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another Steven Bird initiative, the unenforceable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has held events since 2015, there is a risk that small and non-so small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">The following applies to the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that accept diversity - safe environments where residents don't have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening to it is often associated with understanding" "" "these events, instead," "" "listen to appreciate, feel, touch" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers first introduce and translate their history in their own language, or then explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not professional storytellers, their devotion and representation lead to the fact that the audience insists on it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotion, as if the language no longer has a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate also takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyuginsky tells the fables of the rabbit and the baboon in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"" "after explaining the meaning of his parable, John Nyuginsky is asked:" "" "how is this to speak to an audience who doesn't understand your language?" "" "with a broad smile, he shares his sense of inclusiveness:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were entirely with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">Up to now, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand this. all who are inspired by the project can come in contact with TLS to organize their own storytelling.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of reviewing the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounts to 72 million US dollars, several religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017; the march started at the Capitol, the capital of the capital, and went to Plaza de ColÃ³n in the old town of San Juans.</seg>

<seg id="1186">MÃ©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a researcher in the France-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara RÃ¼hling, Managing Director of Book Sprints, a publisher of books completed by so-called 'Book Sprints', read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The cost of freedom: a collective investigation).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, published last year and is available in license-free, contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It pays homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book aims to discuss how to build movements for Free Knowledge and what are the real costs associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense from our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartoum, the beloved and celebrated Internet Volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was taken from the directory of the Adra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about his current state or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Collective recollection gives his friends and family a voice that pushes for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, instantly.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has let many of us begin thinking about their own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up at times of extreme beliefs in this process?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred to an unknown place from the Adra prison, a non-military institution.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "Military Police" Bassel on the basis of a "strictly secret" command of the military court removed from his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she was contacted on 12 November 2015 by persons who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His whereabouts and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a decisive role in extending access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently the manager of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basque's cultural prototypes was more predictive than the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the cross of many civilizations and here Greek-Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time Bassel could not yet know that ten years after he began this work, the IS would make everything possible to wipe out this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">"" "" "" "tragically, Bassel couldn't finish this project until now." ""</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English, even when he was already in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">He taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (waiting), a commission which she wrote in the years 2012-2015 to her husband when he was in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together on the book for one year.</seg>

<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted with anger on a corruption incident in which a member of the government returned to the office in the state apparatus after half of his sentence to which corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and, together with four other defendants, was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment for the destruction of 54 million Metical (about 800,000 euros).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, whose advice was provided by Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 due to good leadership and immediately called for his re-adjustment to the company, which took place on 19 April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic who rejected the application, there would be no barrier for Cambaza to refer back to his old post because the firm did not undertake any disciplinary proceedings after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many people do not welcome the action.</seg>
<seg id="1261">In an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, condemned the company's decision to re-establish the director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and underlines the lack of transparency and is even a backward step in the efforts of our legal system, such as CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take note is that the firm should also initiate a disciplinary proceedings against the contrary.</seg>

<seg id="1267">He could hold lectures and motivate speeches, he could advise and polish up his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But being incompetent, he consented to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to inflict harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Consequently it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>

<seg id="1273">Cambaza failed to return to morality and to serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served itself in the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as if it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself was tired of this man who was pre-charged and finally sentenced to a long prison term.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the network because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook is censoring the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or Towards (in Burmese writing) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciating connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may be associated with racism today, but the word itself does not automatically evoke hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts where they discussed the use of the word or expressed doubt for their use have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with different meanings, which have the same letter sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, Burmese chair is also written as' Kalar htaing ', which contains the same letters as well as other words like' Kalar pae '(Spage blower),' Kalar OAT '(camel) or' kalarkhair '(curtain).</seg>

<seg id="1302">The sentence ku la - "healing" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - is very similar to the racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>

<seg id="1309">"" "for example" "" "Kalar Htine" "" "(chair) and" "" "Kalar pae" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists who spread hate speech have received quite a good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise her nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to everyone who disseminates hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative way of writing the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his posts when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banished by the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was aware of this new Facebook policy, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my mail was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from licking, posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the post was not met by the Facebook community standards. "</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intention or simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Posted without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author gave his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example, the Burmese Internet community to ask for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes to have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but so it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as "chair" or "pea curry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the wrongly solved posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that gave them a great turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Automatic censorship causes a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts containing no hate speech but were still removed:</seg>

<seg id="1336">Over the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence have increased.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks should also heat up violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in the area of Rakhine, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was criticized for his failure to control the proliferating hate speech on his Burmese pages.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of just censoring the word 'Kalar' it would have been better going to look at context rather than on code concentrating initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1345">Before this change of marriage, some members of Hindu and Muslim denominations adhered to the practice, and in May 2016 there was a great public outcry. at that time, Brother Harrypersad Maharaj, the leader of the Inter-Religious Organization (IRO), said that the State should not interfere, as that is, age does not have maturity.

<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who had already been married at 15 in Trinidad and Tobago was 2.8 percent, and at 18 it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the Federal Statistical Office confirmed that between 1997 and 2007 more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married at 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements, which were striving to abolish laws for children's marriage, followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring about this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">However, everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "a Hindu leader, for example, had no qualms about saying the critics of the children's marriage, they were supposed to take care of their own affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this really uncomplicated situation, and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the bill at all.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017 the draft law against the children's marriage was decided - despite four senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"" "" "" "now only the president of the country must agree and let the law be announced." ""</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators posted a status update on Facebook, which Leslie-Ann Boiselle posted on Instagram once more:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the draft law against the children's marriage was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and none of them voted against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After it was decided previously in the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were thrilled because the laws for children's marriage were finally changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who is a ministerial post in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It took too much time and unnecessary talk that obscured the core of the matter, but do you know what? the children's marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that is worth almost every price.</seg>

<seg id="1376">Months ago, Maharaj has announced his intention to take judicial action, the law should be passed, and he seems to make his promise now.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the Attorney General Paris Al rawi, an advocate of the law, said it was quite legitimate when Maharaj wanted to go against the law, most social media users wanted to approach the debate in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Vorrell suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, instead of discussing the discussion so broadly, in a way that can only evoke panic and disgrace, instead of talking about the problem that the state, our daughters, protects that it may be misused by large, hard-boiled males who are opposed to them, "would you then be willing to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">However, whether it comes to legal action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where the child marriage is legal or still the norm, even though there are laws that prohibit it.</seg>

<seg id="1394">Day after day it becomes clearer how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech-savvy Internet users are used to using bypassing tools for blocked websites (a current article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking article from Wikipedia, as recently described in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blocking of the Internet has been taking place since 2007 after the Internet Law (No. 5651) has been adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform continues to be locked, several mirrors (pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and often updated) are now surfaced.</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System) when the platform cleared all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. machine computer connections), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is available in spite of the legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blogpost, IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After listening to the news (via Wikipedia), we put everything in place to take snapshots from Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. thus, it is possible to read the content in a distributed and distributed manner.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least view all Wikipedia articles, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia-Foundation, and it is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiknopedi.org, an aberration page from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors if locked in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>

<seg id="1410">One accessing a different URL that is not the original. that which one sees then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server further directs the request to the right Wikipedia page, so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself when locked in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurry with poorly positioned motifs and washed-out colours.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera himself and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then he was a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepal's wildlife to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown, right next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this privileged situation helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of the Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navarra (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rapti River would be a leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was located and I immediately started to kindle pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar seeks cooperation with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know [it], for he stood by reason of tigers face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep during sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Bedtime for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the King of the bush appeared. he immediately sat down, we look at us and he stares me through the scarf-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">"" "to promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar places the logo" "" "I click for conservation" "" "(lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos." ""</seg>
<seg id="1435">But his passion for the promotion of Nepalese nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Otters at Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version has been re-published here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women with utmost care avoid speaking the name of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "instead they use a pronouns or say" "" "father of my child." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that they respect the husband on the basis of social pressure, as well as the fear of the consequences they should disregard the norm, maintain this practice in life.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian State of Odisha by a false court and expelled from her family and the village community after having addressed a married relative with his name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of naming their wives by name is also common among men. however, they have far fewer admittances to fear, if any, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel and housewives, joined a unique club and became the main topic of discussion of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, it is part of the campaign # Khelplal, which is run by the Community Video Volunteers and stands for the dismantling of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pax has been working with her video camera for seven years on the discovery of practices, such as children's marriage and the exile of HIV / AIDS infected individuals, and manages these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her discussion was about women who did not name their husbands on their behalf.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to pronounce the name of their husbands aloud, is a custom that they have all afforted and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is regarded as deceitful, as a woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about it until this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try out at home as it is going.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini narrates:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said that I should call him by his name from now on." ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage, Rohini launched her first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" before. some believed it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to initiate the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, annoyed, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then she asked them all," "" "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, does that mean they don't respect us?" ""</seg>

<seg id="1500">"" "" "" "some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands over their lips," "" "says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about breaking a centuries-old tradition in which married women can never pronounce the name of their husbands." ""</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini narrates:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she was chastening during the whole exercise; another decided to leave out all the pent up frustration against him and his family by cursing it.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the adrenaline rush about having broken with an ancient tradition, the women decided that at home they would actually try to name their husbands on their behalf.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">Over the next few days, Rohini has received a large number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in her head: his wife couldn't stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini thought I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation became violent.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing a finger-red dot on the forehead indicating the status of the marriage:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women just have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would wear the interest-red dot if he did it too.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He just laughed and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not stopped completely with it, but think that they are now in a better position to choose for themselves not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make a trip on every discussion club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to worry about who could hear what could hear," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In recent months, for the first time in their lives they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sang and spoke about things they had never thought of before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, for example how our identities are tied to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say certain things loud, no matter how small they happen to you.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only carried saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most, this is okay, but some wanted to wear a Salman-Kurta, a wide shirt over a pair of trousers; they didn't dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much strife and discussion about the advantages of their choice of clothes, the morals associated with the saris and much more, smuggled Rohini added their own pair of Kurtas (Obershirts) into a discussion round so that the women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will do it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club, Rohini confirmed that things are moving slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only done small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then stopped saying the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some of them, including me, do it, but only when they are alone and no other family members are there.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two still say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberrot on their forehead now at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the violets for more freedom of movement or the choice of clothes - lie at the end of a river that is difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How to explain Rohini:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1549">On June 29 this year was the hashtag in the Japanese twitter trend, in which many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The visit of the Beatles in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a solstice in Japanese culture in the post-war period.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumiko, who exclusively interviewed the Beatles in 1964 in London, noticed in 2016 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the first visit:</seg>
<seg id="1552">For just under five days the Beatles were in the country, but this was enough to let the Japanese go through.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The people here have quickly become clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many well-known Japanese sizes had reached their zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The cult band's music is "more than just a universal language," said Ryuichi Isaka, president of the retailer Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Good morning! today is the Beatles commemoration day in Japan. I was here in Tokyo 51 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Even today, songs from the Beatles are sung in Japanese karaoke bars and in English classes at Japanese middle schools.</seg>
<seg id="1558">The Beatles kitsch survives all.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Today, Beatles-memorial day is celebrated.</seg>
<seg id="1560">We all love the Beatles in our house.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "I don't know if this" "" "Winnie the Pooh" "" "doll John Lennon is supposed to represent or not." ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">And as it is for fans, Japanese naturally also make pilgrimages to the well-known places connected with the band.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In case you love the Beatles, these are your 5 places you absolutely have to visit.</seg>
<seg id="1564">1) Abbey Road</seg>
<seg id="1565">2) Mathew Street (Liverpool)</seg>
<seg id="1566">3) Strawberry Fields (Memorial in New York)</seg>
<seg id="1567">4) Penny Lane</seg>
<seg id="1568">5) (From the link) The Beatles Story (Museum), Liverpool</seg>
<seg id="1569">Sometimes pilgrimages can't be bizarre enough:</seg>
<seg id="1570">Good morning together.</seg>
<seg id="1571">Today, Beatles-memorial day is celebrated.</seg>
<seg id="1572">Exactly today in 1966, the Beatles came to Japan for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">The characters from the movie K-On! went on a pilgrimage to London and walked over Abbey Road.</seg>
<seg id="1574">We did the same last year too.</seg>
<seg id="1575">And of course some companies also use the fan base from the market, such as this Ramen shop (Ramen are Japanese noodles) in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Good morning, here is Mutahiro Koya Ramen! today is Beatles-memorial day.</seg>
<seg id="1577">And what could it be for a day?</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping of bald people for organ trade, presumably for superstitious purposes, troubles the police of ZambÃ©zia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month, three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometers from Malawi's border.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was decapitated and part of the organs had been removed.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently, they confessed that the organs of shamans were used in Tanzania and Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There was a local superstition that the head of a bald man could bring gold or wealth, the police spokesman at ZambÃ©zia declared the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the aim of killings for obscure purposes, are people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the fact that the UN 2016 launched a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in neighbouring Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to fight these superstitions and prejudices.</seg>

<seg id="1595">He warned those who are going to travel to the country:</seg>
<seg id="1596">Warning to kahle men who travel to Mozambique, men of bald men in Mozambique are the goal of ritual attacks, warned the Mozambican police according to the latest assassination of three men of bald men due to their body parts.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Milange, where the killings took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Husky Algy Adamo, student and resident of the city of Inhambane in the south of Mozambique, said that the local police are already following the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of the bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of MorRumbala, Province of ZambÃ©zia, for probably superstitious rituals, has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans (PRM), which also indicates that a faith existed, according to which the victims in the head would have power generating wealth.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In recent days, three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1602">Angela Ferreira Samantha shared on Facebook the chronicle of Bloggers poor Snaippa, indicating that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique:</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, probably made recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo draws attention in the international community after his attorney announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized due to liver cancer at the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (state risk), having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto demanding the democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Liu case as an" "" "internal issue" "" "and a spokesman told that he considered it" "" "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nonetheless, China continues to receive calls from the international community, the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, to allow or to allow him a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarized some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations According to United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">A spokesman, however, refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Liu to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway in Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Brende have refused to answer any questions about Liu's release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway was stalled after the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 was awarded to Liu, although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon exports to China, as the exports were largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope of unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his prize.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately release Liu and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called for China to release Liu as she announced on June 30:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to lift up all the restrictions of Mr. Liu's wife and family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They are to be able to meet and receive all visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>
<seg id="1651">United States of America</seg>
<seg id="1652">Us ambassador Terry Branstad shared with the fact that the Americans "wish him that he has the opportunity to treat abroad in so far as he can help him with his recovery."</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman for the US embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced on June 27 that the message told the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu but also to release his wife Liu Xia from their house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "the call of the US Embassy drew a furious response from China, with the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that" "" "no country has the right to interfere and irresponsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley said that China should offer the couple:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom, such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his election, to which they claim according to the Chinese constitution and the legal system as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The US Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to urge the Chinese government to unconditionally release Liu and his wife.</seg>

<seg id="1661">Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on the G20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources in Beijing reported to the Reuters news agency that China had big concerns about whether the vortex around Liu could overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada and Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum called on China to provide Liu with appropriate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu lawyer previously told AFP that Liu Xia, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always supervised the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to talk to someone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues to tell:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada is calling on China to maintain its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and to allow for the enforcement of these rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France and France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's Foreign Ministry urged China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons in a statement on 29 June:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he needs regardless of where. furthermore, his wife and family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">While the news channel France Info has already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the State Department announced that there is no further information on whether France will eventually accept it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan Airport in Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of landlandlords in Taiwan suggested China on 27 June to release Liu and show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislator Yu Mei-nu of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very concerned about Liu in an explanation on June 28, and admitted that many asked him to pray for Liu's well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, more stable and prosperous China, which in turn contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt personally very moved and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, signed the Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Licence: CC0 domain public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised as an independent state at an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of the meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York, the Minister remarked that many people criticised the dominance of Singapore's only political party because they compared Singapore to other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports that Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "twist logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices, to create this precious land, we hear that we are ultimately not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you're not my country, whose land is it?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very posh: he defended an idea, according to which the political system of Singapore could not compete with other "normal countries," in the light of that, he inevitably appeared undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, cities that are permanently guided by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the core of the subject, the good old lyre appears again from the authoritarian rulers, who pretend to be democrats, abandons the twisted logic, because it fits better to its power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, the answers given by Shanmugam last week to his American guests regarding our press, our judicial system, our political system, were truly non-replies.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He tarred corresponding questions with non-answers in a rational manner.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for shanmugam to clarify his opinion, since she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally, I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to what country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very thankful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to enlighten this point, provided he was highly paid to be part of the government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his comment on the blog, he points to the critics that one should begin to read the entire co-ordinance of the conference so that one could better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore was more of a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "he explained why the Singapore elections are so unequal, even if we enjoy free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said that Singapore was" "" "no country" "", "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, which makes this polemic statement as leader of a growing generation.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice said of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Guard, what I expected - do I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of political leaders in Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure that he really believes it, associates correctly and is aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review identifies the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "did Mr Shanmugam have committed" "" "good faith a mistake" "" "or was it a Freudian advocate?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only considered an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, what country do the sovereign rights of Singapore return to?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">"" "" "" "as he plays an important role within the government cabinet, Mr Shanmugam's statements are of serious importance." ""</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapur render their military service, but do not defend their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who has to pay back our Prime Minister bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">If the journal Journey of a Decade tends to be a Bejahung, Singapore is and has always been a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"" "" "" "I didn't say what I said..." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1730">This set seems to have annoyed many Singaporans...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody has ever said Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"" "I can understand that we often hear statements such as" "" "the defense of the country especially" "", "but that is not quite correct." ""</seg>

<seg id="1745">On my clarification, most of the time the standard answer follows: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many Canadians might cook inwardly against anger if they are held for Americans, but it doesn't bother me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who does not know himself, there is little that Canadians differentiates us from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians can make a Canadian flag well visible on their backpack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All dear Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans, on the other hand,....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was already when I began travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11.</seg>

<seg id="1759">We are not like these guys south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate that.</seg>
<seg id="1762">First, I have many American friends I admire very much.</seg>

<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">There are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">First, to be called "nice" means to be spiciously - just like the good, gentle, but tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders from "The Simpsons" (which has its own Canadian double-worker).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada is really a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, it would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing you can encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless means being unobtrusive and uninteresting and not earning any attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be something good if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, away from the things that happen around you.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go so far as to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs.</seg>
<seg id="1775">"" "what outsiders call" "" "nice" "" "is perhaps just cool politeness." ""</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians don't often talk about the fence across the fence.</seg>

<seg id="1780">A pop-band, famous in Thailand, has released a music video that parodicates the junta, which seized power in 2014 and despite its promises to restore the civilian government, continues to dominate the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">"" "the new song" "" "Dictator Girl" "" "(Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells you what rules his girlfriend is doing." ""</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not expressly political, the music video still refers to the continued military rule of the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country's situation.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video of the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Within the first three days, the video uploaded to Facebook was 1.254 times divided and received 8,800 Likes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video "Der dictator" was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, in particular to how it behaves in the position of the country under the junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these recordings of the video that refers to some of the political issues that Thailand has persistently pursued over the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">The "44 Rules of the Girls" may refer to the draconian section 44 of the preliminary constitution, which gives the supreme commander of the army absolute decision making over important national issues.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The 11th rule: "change your attitude" refers to the notorious programme for "changing the settings" of journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other people who are considered critics by the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other reviewers of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was also established in the army that supervises online content and accused persons accused of having slandered the monarchy to prosecute.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand employs a strict law against "Read Majesty" (majesty's insult).</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, martial law was proclaimed in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later, it came to a coup d'etat of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the Junta continues to pursue is its decision to buy expensive U-boats, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax payers.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The video even shows how people are thrown into a black delivery van before putting them into an internment warehouse, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">"" "some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused" "" "confusion" "" "in society and Internet users are threatened with long imprisonment, they should offend the monarchy." ""</seg>
<seg id="1799">Meanwhile the teaser of the song showed members of the band, who imitated the Salut from "The Tribute of Panem," which was already used by coup opponents during the protests in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="1805">Now more than 20 years have passed since the Georgian-Abchassic war has been officially ended, but its scars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The abandoned villages of the northern district of Tkuarchal show striking images.</seg>
<seg id="1807">Villages such as Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and Kharlechava are located in the hydroreservoir of Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups such as Russians, Greeks, Asia Minor, Georgians and Armenians lived and worked together in Soviet times in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their homes during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, the largest part of Russia and Abchasen live in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called ghost towns in Abchasia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">During the pre-war period more than 10.000 people lived here, today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic of Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of the area has been 16.000 people, having barely risen over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989, some 43.000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, located on the Guatemalan border.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is managed by a 59-year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral pink Brillenframe and golden earrings in teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. however, they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel doesn't have any charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about $2.50 the night sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the vestibule there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - however, hundreds of African and Haitian migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Ms RamÃ­rez, the people come to the full mini-busses and from the upper part of the coast they start crying: "mum Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year RamÃ­rez has already welcomed 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some even slept on cardboard outside.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are ill, they buy drugs that they cannot pay, they massage them with a balm the feet exhausted by the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychque Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Ms RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The family Sebastiao (with its daughter Mercalli, who has a yoghurtbart) posed with ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"" "" "" "yes, yes," "" "he answers with a smile." "" "I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women." ""</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao is traveling with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">"" "the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." "" "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," "" "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">He says that the Haitians and the Africans often travel together and that Africans already speak at Whatsapp of Ms RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy became weaker, it began its journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs. RamÃ­rez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "mum Africa is our mother and we never leave her again," "" "he answers, smiling." "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. RamÃ­rez narrates that her guests often send her text messages when they went to greet her or to tell her about the course of her trip.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the driving force of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to prepare chickens like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">MS RamÃ­rez is perhaps very well-known here, but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to JesÃºs Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have welcomed migrants in their little house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to many African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment, 25 people are there, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "I lived in the United States," "" "he says." "" "I have experienced what they are experiencing." ""</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people can help and not help others. that's why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his place of employment.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants traveling through Tapachula come from Central America, other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez told me that he fled to people in Honduras with his wife and his three children who wanted to blackmail him money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown woman, a single educator, offered him her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go the next step.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Afrika, everything is full of guests again.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the aisles, travelers will consult their telephones quietly.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, most of them from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. RamÃ­rez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she smothers her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair ties her an Kundin has made, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly, while she briefly presents her to me.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," she repeats it every time. "you have gone."</seg>

<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjiang of Twitter users.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities region in western China, are forced to install spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi were given a cell phone notification in which it instructs the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in this announcement, it is said that the" "" "app" "" "should prevent access to terrorist information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities did not use the app for more than combating terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because they had exchanged messages with a private WeChat group shortly after they had installed the app.</seg>
<seg id="1966">The police revealed that the app would identify and prosecute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwang's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is blocking pornographic web pages, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to alert users how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with children's filters will help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" might enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to monitor the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While announcements about digital censorship in China often focus on users' experiences in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those living in remote, repressed ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and dissatisfaction in the conflict regions, the authorities often prescribe extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">"" "the Twitter based media outlet" "" "Images from mainland China" "", "published in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where police inspectors randomly checked the inhabitants to see if they had installed the monitoring app." ""</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjiian make sure people use the official Jingwang App.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile message requested that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, you may be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced the people to use devices intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by rest-growth technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"" "" "" "images from mainland China" "" "(partly available on-site) also published a Jingwang product description from which the software can lift up the password request of a Windows operating system and thus obtain unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive." ""</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council to minimise the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and related institutions, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the cyber security office on the operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent Freedom House report, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new monitoring methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities issued a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media memory cards" with the local police until August 1.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos"; however, this action infringes the personal rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a number of other possible offences, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and opposition</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors; sometimes he smiles to his screen, sometimes to his computer, sometimes to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips infected with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives on the top floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel accomplished its occupation of the West Bank and Hdaib's family had to flee from their village in Palestine, where they lived as felahyees (such as Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and asks their old-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapeseed.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all of these issues are relevant not only in his home town of Amman, but also in cities that range from Damascus to Syria through to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">At the age of 25, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not constrained by borders in his thinking, and he can feel with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not admit it openly, he has a special aversion to the US foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones has something to do with his identity as "Palestinian refugees of the second generation." he describes himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think so because of my own circumstances," "" "said Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so, because I am a man," while he pours in water dissolved NescafÃ© in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has little to do with a protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Generally speaking, the swarms speak lukewarm coffee and the squadron of the Kent cigarette in the nose in the first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air, especially when you look at the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as drinking water in the public during Ramadan - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry, Jordaniens, canceled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some members of Parliament who support the Islamic Campaign - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front singer Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert evening.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"" "the deputies and former press secretary of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert" "" "just" "" "had been cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer." ""</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters like the Arab Spring, human rights and free expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which raises the tried-and-tested legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila underestimated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," who continue to opt for an intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is probably not simply a rhetorical rhetoric, but actually mirroring an ever-clear emerging reality in Jordan which clearly appears in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib dropped traditional gender norms by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a woman who is clearly distressed, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">"" "in the past years, the number of" "" "honourable morals" "" "has taken place in Jordan." ""</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honourable murders reached its zenith in 2016; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on the fight against crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can "be held in prison for an indefinite period of time," and for their release, many years of bureaucratic expenditure and the guarantee of the family are often necessary for the woman to take nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaib's music is also very popular and is well known to not shy away from issues that have long been taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music, full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression, from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "" "" "politics has been fed me," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib seized the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and in" "" "Ghareeb" "", "the focus is on poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are politically at the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song titled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song one verse repeats itself remarkably often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which one, in his words, "can get what you want" - be it faith or non-belief, heterogeneity or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gays and lesbians and that comments on the equality of LGBTQ + individuals were still strongly censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, in order to realize later that his comments were torn out of context, twisted and censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but streamed was only a edited version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib is openly campaigning for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance towards homosexuals does not correspond to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nueva, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in memory thanks to his homophobic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nueva, who was supposed to work on behalf of the caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not do that?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemian kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian news service established several former members of government and members of the teacher association, arguing that they have critically voiced concerns about the problems inherent in the country's deep-rooted corruption.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaibs's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to create a structural rethinking in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has now denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - it sees Hdaib - consists of slow, devotional and internal changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day at the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the end, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he not only dreams of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to" "" "experience it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will be approached by music, art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and democracies brought about by artificially. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until that time, Hdaib will continue to rap and consequently resist.</seg>

<seg id="2149">"" "" "" "Nebuta in Aomori" "" "is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan." ""</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big extravagant warrior puppets are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebula festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One assumes that it is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the festive cars, the drums and the dancing have been handed over for more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies of the West invaded Japan in the north-east to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the emisas, to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebula festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We could grab a couple of great seats so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can hardly imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital city, Meguro Gajen, hosted a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally.</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking at the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two festive cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebula festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer:</seg>

<seg id="2167">Outside appearances and personal care were seldom as important as in this story, because they help to keep away from crime the Peruvian youth and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the hairdresser.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate where street noise and illegal drug trafficking are all commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region is not safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend to copy the appearance and thus also the fancy hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) has led to becoming more and more regular citizens in the experienced hands of hairdressers, who can reproduce these complex hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the ultimate limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event, the hairstyle competition "Batalla de Barberos," which has been held since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There, experts compete against each other to show who can create the most eccentric looks, as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions like the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, who are located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to trade their arms against hairdressing tools and instead of bad advice to get a training in hairdressing technique that allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered, dozens of young people saw that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Before the school year beginning in March, the school offered special training workshops and reported some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district to which we are very proud, because out of love for the children we have built this educational community.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: letters of love to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the paper" "" "Love messages to guerrilla fighters" "" "published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Isn't it even more important to meet people who feel ejected?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This was exactly the question of the young Colombian activists Leonardo PÃ¡rraga of the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired them to write Cartas por la distliaciÃ³n (letters of reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Recently their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part to it: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had signed a peace treaty with the FARC guerrilla movement (German: revolutionary armed forces in Colombia), forming the point of view of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signing of the peace treaty was considered to be so significant that the Colombian President JosÃ© Manuel Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">There is, however, a long way ahead of the Colombians until one can speak of true reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrillas who have lived in illegal camps for many years, who were exposed to war rhetoric and wore their weapons around the clock, must now again integrate themselves into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, which was accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred of guerrilla fighters, must now take them into their ranks and support them in setting up a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians had to join together and help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: up to now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back into society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter who will then be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for reconciliation was born at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share in this year his love with people who needed most urgently.</seg>
<seg id="2198">So the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC who now have their place in society and build a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were delivered on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the region of Caldono-Cauca.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo von der Foundation BogotArt travelled to the camp to personally hand over the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC were as they had done earlier to receive orders from their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," said Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, an employee of the Governor of the Province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a sort of hut in which the guerrillas live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go into it, because next to him on the bed was a MGL-garnet, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I spoke to him anyway and asked," "" "Hello, what are you doing right now?" "" "he answered," "" "I answer a letter someone wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very beautiful and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "never in my life someone wrote me something so beautiful, so I answer." "" "suddenly tears ran on my cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him and sat down beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was also tired of the war, it was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this warrior, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never expected something different from life than a war. joining the FARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers before starvation. "I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know there is a society outside that waits for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices and voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the start of the event, students and some leader of the FARC were invited to a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why the leaders of the FARC have declared the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the State dealt with the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can help shape society more just in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a goal of this magnitude, it is worth to overcome all obstacles," "" "one of them said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear these people who have never heard a hearing and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hate, even just people with beautiful feelings turned around by their circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives is hurting me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and so much damage, can teach us something and give us a smile and embrace.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, Archbishop of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombians were prophesied that peace would reign after disarming.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there are inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people ready to resort to arms, rise up and protest for their rights. and that is fully justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC now focus on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call upon all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those dreaming of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and sacrifice as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2257">It was a friend of Dagestan, a woman who was in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took her without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he'd be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread them all over the Internet, with my phone number and a picture of mine. he sent them to his Chechen friends, with the following message: "then there are no more men in Chechnya who can eliminate this shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, the photos of my documents made the rounds through WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">I was attacked on 10 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was about to bring out a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying, "Here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "then I heard a sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" "" "how long will you still honor the family, you stain?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I did not know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that it was a young man, no 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up again in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had received everything and began to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which hospitals were you placed - in which of the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and laid me on the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for having dealt with me respectfully.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They asked me to return to Chechnya to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They posed absurd demands: some told me that I must prove it by running on top without going through the streets; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Grozny and say that I had not changed my gender, that everything was only bad talk, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people spoke once my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "They have brought a monster to the world that has damaged not only your family, but the entire republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she put a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later a car with darkened windows and a number sign stood under the window with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, I realized that something was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights activists checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to disclose their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help, I left the country, but then something incredible happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before I left Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought them without registering myself, without identification, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came and checked in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"" "at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I received a message:" "" "you don't believe you would be safe just because you left the country?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know at which hotel you are stuck. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "only to prove it: it is the number 115." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This indeed was my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we do not talk about gender equality, that is a taboo theme.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditionally Caucasian elements I still bear in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I can't overcome this spiritual barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with the camera, I really try to look at the person she reminds of her past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know anything about the situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who have stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For him, I needed updated information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who sat in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan there were no people arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"" "so I mean, they probably invite the relatives, these take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand proof that the so-called" "" "honor" "" "has experienced through blood satisfaction." ""</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still trapped in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says that there are not many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If then, especially those who have no rich relatives or were dropped by their relatives to face Kadyrow's judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that they can be presented as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say:" "" "should they be killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people had not simply disappeared, they were deliberately submerged in order to radicalise themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this only a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was detained in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people in this prison have disappeared after their beard grew.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was himself when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, but there were no reports so far. however, we suspect that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would you not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know whether these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya, I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think that before 2003 I was already known in Grozny, when I was still living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even between 1998 and 1999, when Sharia was applied, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">Russia originally intended to lead us to "civilising" but ultimately has thrown us back into the Stone Age.</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had colored eyelashes, wore tubular jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Security of Sharia has never bent my hair on me.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theater in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks stood, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"" "in the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that means:" "" "mock not on the misfortune of another." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you because they thought you're sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never hunted and never struck me.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: until Kadyrov stepped on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to talk about morality in television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not talk about us per se, but rather about the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how people in the city started to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had smiled and laughed at first looked at you with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the republic steadily deteriorated.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what kind of activity do you do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as a activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organise tea meetings, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get food maps.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't spend a cent on it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I picked up the type of refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hiddenoff?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature is, it has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens, who want to prophesy to you with foam in front of your mouth that there are no gays with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The damners have what the cabariners have, the Russians have which; on the whole planet they have - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I'm from there, so it's unpleasant for me to hear something like that.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Know, many think with transient to men who love men, and they believe that one changes their sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different kinds of feeling to be exact, different attitudes of life.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn against an increase of suicide within the impoverished Arab Ahrazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahraz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last months there has been a sharp rise in suicide.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27 drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ahrazi community in Iran, which is shaped by poverty and unemployment.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahraz region in the south-west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability for his family to pay, so Ahrazi human rights groups who want to work in Ahraz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had kindled himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was taken to Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors could not do anything.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ahrazi minority, and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take their lives.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahrazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Hamid manifesto, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab will have hanged Tamim.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: it was all fathers of the family who were helpless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government, to feed their families and to pursue a safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahrazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region in which a large part of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the local Arab population to make their living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahraz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and in 1925 it made great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahraz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">In spite of these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population receives little from this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated illnesses, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime systematically denies the Ahrazi Arabs working places in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a large number of dams, the water from the Arab areas to the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to aggravate devastation caused by dryness, and destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi youngsters rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian Director General for Cooperation, Labour and Social Welfare, reported that 5% of Ahrazis, who are looking for a job, completed primary school, completed 55% of a secondary school and 45% had a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahrazi human rights activist living in London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" in the number of suicide among young Ahrazi.</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians emerging in Ahraz and anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">As officials and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers, the local Arab Ahrazi is deprived of access to work opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of the national resistance of young Arabs and force them to earn their living outside their home country of Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their affiliation to the Ahrazi and be hired as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone speak the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances surrounding the Arab Ahrazi, human rights activists shake alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is an untreated depression.</seg>
<seg id="2430">Depression is treatable and suicide is preventable.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement published by Ayomide Zurichand was originally published on the website AfrofÃ©minas. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions came to expression.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves intersectional feminists - respond with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even suggest well thought-out scientific and social arguments in front of me, why I should be feminist and why we should generally be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women still earn less money today despite equal education than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms always ensure that women come across a glass ceiling sooner or later, and that discrimination on the basis of sex is still across the many different countries and denominations.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is well known to me and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced that I suffer twice and triple underneath.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, when I come to speak on skin color, on racism, on black women's women, black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the diaspora; if I mention the kind we have been abused physically, mentally and verbally, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists have been silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">However, everyone agrees that women - all women - should come together to "lift up their voices and" Kumbaya, my Lord "to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to say that in addition to sexualized violence, there is an institutionalized form of racially motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in twofold manner.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnic groups and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of experiencing domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all people in every skin color to have the same rights; on the other hand, as a black woman, I cannot join a movement in whose center the white woman stands, who refuses to consider injustice in her thinking, which relate both to sex and to the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging to a white-feminist oriented sphere that has always and repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "said Sojourn in 1851:" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "and I too refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a dermal and marginalized being in a historical sense." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropriation in order to promote their egocentric programme.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to explain white women the importance of the overlapping of skin color and gender. some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for the feminist movement stillsilence, no matter how many black women try to teach them for the better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectional feminism was founded in order to give women different backgrounds a home and to isolate themselves from the white feminism, there is still the word "feminism" in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to get rid of feminism completely and to join the movement of the Womanism called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of using me for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, author of the book Africana perhaps anism: Reclaiming (about: Africa-Womanism: as we reconquer ourselves) speaks of how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can in this way also create spaces in which they can be worshipped perfectly and in which the cultural, spiritual, psychological, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped, that make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment, I can lift up black women and women from other cultures, for in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as a part of this paradigm due to my dark skin and my being as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can blossom in an environment where my life is neither bypassed, nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2469">Again and again, Nabil Musa travelled to Iraq in the past 7 years - mostly with surfboards or in canoe - with a special concern of the Kurdistan Region in Iraq. his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations.</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentary by Emily Kinskey, we follow Musa, who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I really wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a child," Musa tells.</seg>
<seg id="2472">Scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, the construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development, will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="2473">Musa is a member of the Non-Governmental Organization Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq, as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2474">At the end of the video, Musa summarizes the urgency and importance of his work in one question: "if we don't have any water, how would we survive?"</seg>
<seg id="2475">This video was produced, filmed and published for Ensia by Emily Kinskey, a documentary filmmaker and multimedia journalist based in Erbil, Iraq.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and edited version of the article "The Wave of Violence Against Women in Paraguay" by Current. the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# weighteinefraubin), which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police inspector said Ada BÃ¡ez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner who had become violent against her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship, some time had passed and the police said their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman showed Balbuena about mistreatment, Ada BÃ¡ez's clear display also did not help.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman withdrew her advert.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women make a complaint at all, they generally do not receive support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases women are financially dependent on men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women, who admit to be victims of violence, are at all reported to prosecution authorities.</seg>

<seg id="2490">It is hard to find out how many women are really ill-treated, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Estudios, a social scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are different information and reports that do not even show the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">The available numbers, however, are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, 9600 were reported to the District Attorney Office because of domestic violence. 70% of them were violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 advertisements for domestic violence in the courts of peace. here again, 86% of the ads of women came.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women claimed that they were physically mistreated, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics, however, do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan women minister Ana Baiardi only a few of these crimes are actually shown. "to every woman who reports in Paraguay for psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do so come.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "" "" "every woman refunded due to physical abuse has two women who do not do so," "" "she stated at the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since the murder of women in Paraguay is not an own criminal offence, law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016, journalists accounted for at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, every ten days in Paraguay a woman dies because of violence through men.</seg>

<seg id="2505">Before Mariana BrÃ­tez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called him the names of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning she didn't want it, but then she still gave up. this should regret her forever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer collaborated with Carlos. but for two years she endured psychic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognize:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I would never have thought that I would once again be victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that this only happens to women who are too subservient because they are fooled by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming names, she wrote articles on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship, describing how he had isolated her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people answered their posts, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had fallen by Carlos so long and did not leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as though they wanted to say that the victims of abuse had at least a certain complicity in it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, not native to Paraguay, fought with the authorities in Paraguay for almost eight years to prove that her former partner mistreated her.</seg>
<seg id="2517">"" "Victoria is a member of the" "" "Yo te Creo" "" "network (" "" "I believe you" "" "), which consists of women, who are all victims of abuse." ""</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the testimonies of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorian's case everything began with psychic abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner finally managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat her.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victoria's ads with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives, she received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She led a process against her former partner who developed into an unmanageable legal battle between Paraguay and her native country, in which it mainly revolved around money, power and the influence of her former partner.</seg>

<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On August 10, 2016 a draft law was discussed in the Paraguayan Parliament, which became known under the hashtag # Porelas (# for you).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and movement # NiUnaMenos (# non-Easy) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law proposes to declare feminists a stand-alone criminal offense and punish harsher as is the case in the neighboring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus the legislative text was changed in a number of points to include members of the law, fearing that the way to decriminalize abortions is being levelled, which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and punishable with up to five years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill had envisaged the large part of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs that the victims of violence must bear, if they just want to reimburse and provide a secure accommodation to the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, abuse is seen as part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">"" "" "" "here a rethinking must take place so that violence can no longer be seen as normal." ""</seg>
<seg id="2537">Those who are silent in the face of these facts are complicit and contribute to the offence of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We have to report as long as abuse is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was adopted in the Paraguayan Senate. prior to that, parts of the law had been modified, including a passage that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2540">Opinions about the changes are diverging.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The passage concerning reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to re-attack its victim.</seg>
<seg id="2542">However, the submission of the words "gender," "political violence" and "sexual harassment" from parts of the law is regarded as a big setback.</seg>

<seg id="2546">"" "" "" "this website was blocked by a resolution of the Minister of Information" "" "on the homepage of the banned newspaper Azamn." ""</seg>
<seg id="2547">More than a year ago, the omanic authorities closed the independent Arab-speaking newspaper Azamn on account of their corruption in the sultan.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, is still in prison, where he served one year imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and brought to trial, but later released again.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been reigning since 1970 by Sultan Qabus ibn Said, who came to power after having abolished his father, Said ibn Taimur, by a coup d "Ã©tat.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to his role as the only Sultan, he has held the main offices in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Finance Minister, Foreign Minister, President of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The rule of the sultan is characterized by the persistent efforts of security forces, in particular the domestic secret service, restricting public freedoms, including freedom of the press, restricting human rights defenders, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists to intimidate and detain.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights and prevent citizens, including activists, to freely express their views on the country's public affairs, such as corruption in authorities and institutions, both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the Azamn newspaper, its closure and the arrest of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper which has been reported since its inception in 2007 on corruption in Oman (an absolute monarchy) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On July 28, 2016, security forces Ibrahim Al-Maamari, editor-in-chief of Azamn, noted that an article was published in the newspaper on July 26, 2016 with the title "High-ranking parties bind hands of justice."</seg>

<seg id="2560">On 3 August 2016, Zaher Al-Abri, member of the Editorial Board, was charged by the ISS before the Special Department and arrested on his arrival by the security forces.</seg>
<seg id="2561">On 9 August 2016, the ISS took over the deputy editor-in-chief Yousef Al-Haj, who had acted as editor-in-chief after Al-Maamaris's arrest.</seg>

<seg id="2563">The trial of Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri took place in Maskat on 26 September 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The Court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were both convicted of disrupting public order, "abuse of the Internet" and "undermining the prestige of the state."</seg>
<seg id="2566">In addition, Al-Haj was found guilty of the violation of a ban on publication and slander.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fines of 3,000 US dollars ($7800), and a one-year ban imposed on both journalists was imposed.</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Rial (2600 US dollars), having been found guilty of using "an information network to spread material that could pose a threat to public order."</seg>
<seg id="2569">A security deposit of $13,000 was fixed for Al-Abri ($13,000) and was released on 22 August 2016 before the judgment of the sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2570">The Appeals Court acquitted Al-Abri in a hearing on 26 December 2016, but sentenced Al-Haj to six months in prison for a year and al-Maamari.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six-month prison sentence from the central prison in Maskat. al-Haj remained in prison, where he served his one-year sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2572">The Appeals Court also summoned the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper "Azamn."</seg>
<seg id="2573">Despite the decision of the Court to allow Azamn again, the newspaper continues to face attacks by the omanic government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On 8 January, the Minister of Information issued an order to extend the closure of "Azamn" by three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Minister of Information personally signed another order in which the closing of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months, with which the Minister asked for the decision of the Court of Appeal to re-launch the publication of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The ongoing closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which Oman has recently violated press freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2577">Other injuries include, for example, the closure of the site of the independent magazine Mowatas and the exercise of pressure on Albalad, the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease operation.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the ongoing closure of Azamn and the detention of journalist Al-Haj, the impression arises that the omanic authorities are still unwilling to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Centre for Human Rights (GCHR) calls on the authorities to:</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. release Yousef Al-Haj immediately and unconditionally;</seg>
<seg id="2581">2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Azamn so that their journalists can pursue their work;</seg>
<seg id="2582">3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and</seg>
<seg id="2583">4. to ensure that human rights defenders and journalists in Oman have been able to exercise their right human rights work unhindered and without fear of retaliation measures, including arbitration.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture takes place with his agreement</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or even mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons why medical research is needed on site: on the one hand, many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent are missing in the supply of global healthcare.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria are far more serious in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for researching these diseases by pharmaceutical companies is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research carried out by African scholars themselves helps build their own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Centre for Infectious Diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">In the 1990s, he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia, just when the AIDS epidemic was the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for studying in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home in order to support the Serbian health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GM): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Rranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the Serbian national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I have just started a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GM: what do you think are the most important current science topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always remain recipients instead of being makers.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not well usable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, because funding and opportunities for development are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GM: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs much money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the public opinion about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GM: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on, and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special scientific training, beginning at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The social sciences, computer sciences, big data, exploration of space, healthcare (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly from this.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GM: can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa vis-Ã -vis western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often it is the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">"" "the system that magazines are only accessible against payment (the so-called" "" "Paywall" "" "), also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research." ""</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "Open Source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has bred salmon in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outre Gorgeous, the first plant grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by his own imagination and the question of how many sorts of lettuce he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them further for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents were used not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties, such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or crimped leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereals or cartes. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts for food security are concerned with the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia of old tradition, Morton is still breeding a salad, but he now needs longer because his work is further complicated by ever more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it's like lying in a river a boulder that I have to paddle." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we have to do it now, but it is a break with the tradition of breeding, "he says." I think that these patents go too far on salads.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand up to court, no one can breed a new type of salad, because all the features are already patented. "so he continues to do as good as possible and tries to breed those characteristics that he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and endeavours not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">It has also joined a movement that is becoming ever larger in the US and throughout the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">"" "astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman salads of the" "" "greenhouse" "" "variety of the station. it is tested there whether plants can be grown in space." ""</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT-area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source seed initiative (initiative for open-source seeds) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was created in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can commit themselves to freely use the seeds bred by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it. "open source" breeders only allow others who purchase their seeds to breed their own varieties, and not to suck it immediately - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patties.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">A gloomy prospect</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the Emeritus Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg, control of seed and the possibility of breeding new plants is important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds are said to play a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">"" "Kloppenburg emphasises that the" "" "open-source" "" "movement does not work with genetically modified plants." ""</seg>
<seg id="2653">All types of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from organic farming or not. "in order to reach our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seed," says he, and participates in the ever-increasing mergers in the global agribusiness, as it is offered for example on farmers markets, should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without a seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source seed initiative are committed to ensuring that their seed continues to be freely available, as opposed to patenting seed and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore increasingly available.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, director of Ossi, has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about one-third of all the carrot characteristics are protected as intellectual property, making it available for plant breeders either not at all or is difficult to use.</seg>
<seg id="2659">Such estimates do not exist for other plants, but experts such as Luby suggest that mass-grown plants such as wheat are patenteed in even bigger style than salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of point of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are bred in such a way that they have targeted characteristics - such by which their taste or colour improves to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is abducted by more and more patents. genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever before, as the changed conditions are much less predictably due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto-spokeswoman Carly Scaduto recognises that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the United States Department of Agriculture, the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, it contradicts the view that intellectual property would restrict other breeders, as" "" "patents and the protection of plant varieties encourage innovation." "" "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent has expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection does not inhibit innovation, but promotes it by providing more material and expertise to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees this differently: waiting for 20 years, until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if one had to wait so long to be able to breed crops adapted to the changed environmental conditions, the struggle would have already been lost.</seg>
<seg id="2669">But the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good, and they should continue to stay: "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and it will be impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">"" "in total, Morton is interfering with the concept of patenting plant characteristics:" "" "we don't really create the features themselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form the plants themselves and as a breeder we have no idea how plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">"" "a secret of nature." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US state of Oregon and Ossi member of the Management Board, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "whoever breeds a variety also breeding its own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation it is necessary to produce massive herbicides, breeds this concept of agriculture in its varieties.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is exactly opposite." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized enterprises (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto) patents, most of the smaller seed companies can survive without patents - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In addition, Morton believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents: "it looks like I am stronger than companies who are patenting with my efforts to produce something new.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest aims of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still block content on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of May 5th, the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports on the above.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published a statement on Facebook, in which the Egyptian authorities criticised for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights information remains true - in spite of this attack and the mocking of Egyptian law and the Constitution by the authorities who are supposed to defend the law and to give victims a voice. even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals, it has never been as important as now.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news site Mada Masr, Arab-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network originating from Qatar for alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organization of the wave of web site closures to the victim. @ anhri one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmVDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada also has no access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the dissemination of columns and articles that he writes for websites and media not accessible in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog he set up to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government itself became the target of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider in which also Ziadas blog is home, is still accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported on student protests and took a video on how the police practiced physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles revolve mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada commented on the government's blocking and reflecting what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to lock is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the blogs of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has been possible for them to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege; arrest, attempted murder, loading by the National Security Council, blocking blogs as well as any other web site for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) They proved that I didn't write for nothing. in other words, my words have influence, albeit only to a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post items to circumvent censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after they have locked it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave walk the way through to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August. this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including orange, Vodafone and ETISALAT.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Furthermore, Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) also documented the blockage of providers that were possible by bypassing internet censorship and private surfing.</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday 12 June we noticed how the blockage of web pages that VPNs offer began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the government's intention to continue to block and filter content to which Egyptian users might have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "the situation is additionally worsened by the fact that censorship decisions are taken behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which it can proceed against these acts in court." ""</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants fight.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day after day newspapers in all of Brazil report with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motives.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "" "" "every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro" "", "" "" "Thieves robbing pharmacy with military weapons," "" "President Temer sends 8500 troops of the army, navy and air to Rio." ""</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio achieved the highest level for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least find the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "the newspaper" "" "Extra" "", "known for detailed reporting on violence in Rio on 16th August, published the Editorial" "" "It is not normal" "", "where she announced to set up a new section called" "" "War in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The newspaper explained the motives for their decision like this:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. anything that happens from the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio is published in the heading "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four minute video shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, explained that this decision was no cause for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war rubric in a country that does not recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to cover cruelty of the police, which first shoots and then asks questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose purpose is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">"" "does the term" "" "war" "" "harm more than it benefits?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist CecÃ­lia Oliveira, on the other hand, argued that violence was a "war." according to her opinion this was a justification for the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to prosecute officials in the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and bad planning - as shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and complacent neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">To remember: the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than just its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2777">"" "according to CecÃ­lia, Rio de Janeiro is wrong:" "" "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country. these are the latest available data." ""</seg>

<seg id="2779">"" "when we look at the Mordrats per federal state, Rio is on number 16," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">It is owned by Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, like CecÃ­lia, has been repeating the state's security policy for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">These security policy measures included the founding of the UPP (Unidade de PolÃ­cia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003, whose goal is to capture a favela by deploying a massive police car and permanently stationing a unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this led to a decline of violent death cases. but after several years the UPP has been increasingly under fire after several reports of harassment and repression against the poor communities that should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux cited one of his articles from 2010, in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also draws serious consequences for the people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">For this demands the state to use means and ways that are typical of a war. this includes penetration into the territory of a "enemy," in which a civilian is an unbearable point in the landscape and becomes an object for collateral damage and "lost bullets."</seg>
<seg id="2787">Going back or forth, the fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas in Rio continue to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2788">A week ago, the police cleared the mountain with the favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident also made headlines: an orchard died as a result of shots that the police had fired from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the following civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to Siege Watch, a joint initiative of the PAX peace organization and the Syria Institute research institute, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Eastern Ghouta region is particularly affected where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21, 2013 prompted the lives of hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition have been based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel-controlled areas outside Damascus have stood under siege, leading to local residents being dependent on locally produced food or tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through years of blockade traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian volunteers and academics teaches the inhabitants of Eastern Ghoutas how they can plant their own mushrooms as a "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghira Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms do not belong to the traditional food in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food is an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The right of the project, Abo Nabil, said to AFP, French news agency:</seg>

<seg id="2814">In order to collect money for the initiative, we can use the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo in consultation with the NGO Ghira Almeida.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to provide 125 families with knowledge about planting mushrooms, such as Dr. Leila zu Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the Constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of around 12,700 â¬, but will continue to collect donations to Cando until Monday 4th September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Due to the shortage of fuel locally produced fuels from plastic are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>

<seg id="2875">Exactly at that time, Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, sat together in Ghazni Province in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even if his mother did not say it at that time, she knew that she would not see her son for a long time - maybe even more.</seg>
<seg id="2877">In the morning, the boy was supposed to break open.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would fetch him and bring him to the bulls.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, leader of the Hezb-e-Wahhabi faction dominated by Hazara, had just been killed by the Taliban and many Hazara felt suddenly defenceless.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred of the Hazara, came closer and closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan again.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his low wages and went to Iran. once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortar, which were heavier than himself, in order to earn his livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then, like today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"" "" "" "it was really tough," "" "said Asharaf in an interview with Global Voices." "" "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the building site, on which we also worked." ""</seg>
<seg id="2892">"" "there were no services there and no heating. we hanged nylon in front of the open windows, so that we did not freeze at night." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous override on the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time Ashark was homeless, ran through the streets of Rome alone, fell asleep in parks and went to a church that distributed food to the needy twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high immigration quotas. it is true, however, that the conditions that asylum seekers find in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that the system suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000" "" "special reception centres" "". "they are improvised equipment in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to the Italian law, asylum seekers can then be admitted to a reception centre only if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - what can be drawn up for months after the asylum application has been registered.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation either depend on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">Thus there was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unrestrained fervour helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After several years of working in the construction industry, Asharaf put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis's success story is now subject to the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") of director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film received the Venice City Award in 2017, which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">A lot of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to inofficial estimates, about 20,000 Afghans are living in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on its way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years some of Afghan companies have arisen, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his orient Orient Experience where the waiters and kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari in Padua opened the restaurant peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">But Asharafs's goals go far beyond the Italian gastronomy business and retailers and aim to return to the country which he forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "where there is a risk, there are opportunities," "" "says Asharaf with a smile." "" "I want to invest in Afghanistan." ""</seg>

<seg id="2929">He reported about the clearing of the camp Raba'a el Adaweya in Cairo, which protested against the decomposition of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Photo of @ Ciluna27 shared on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen report is an international snapshot, showing challenges, wins and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament has reviewed a bill that foresees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook just after registering with a government authority.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users would have to register in order to be able to use the social networks within six months of the successful decision of the law on the authority's website indicating their full name and ID number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Anyone who missed this step could be sentenced to six months' imprisonment or penalties for penalties.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, promoted by sixty members of parliament, is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "another member of the Bundestag submitted a legislative proposal to introduce the tougher punishments for insulting the president or senior officials." ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under Egyptian law, the insult of the president as well as state institutions is already punishable. however, under the law proposition, such a deed would be punished with prison sentences and fines, as legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is passed, this may mean up to three years in prison for the condemned.</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly in any case has been in jeopardy for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian policemen while exercising violence against protesters who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of the elected president Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan was waiting, like more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested in the same incident four years in prison for a court appointment.</seg>
<seg id="2942">His trial was recently postponed to 20 May because the prison management, according to human rights groups, failed to bring the defendants from prison to the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan threatens the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, pseudo-burdening of e.g. weapons possession, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a criminal court in Giza was acquitted by the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were charged for reporting on pro-Morsi seat blockade on Raba'a Al-Adawiya Square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The Court also reduced the punishment of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested during the aforementioned incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activist listens to leaked documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy Project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was mainly heard for a leaked action plan. said plan comes from the President of the Republic, who according to the plan explicitly supports a controversial draft bill that would ensure businessmen and during the former regime dictated by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption, provided that they return all unlawful funds.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on the website of Nawaat on April 21, sheds light on how the presidential plans are made to support the bill.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia rejects the naming of his sources under the provision of Article 11 of the Tunisian Press Code, which ensures journalists the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, he appeared in the District Court of Tunis on May 09 as a witness in the case.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Will China force the users of social media to present their identity?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to new regulations of the People's Republic of China Information Office, users of social media in China require approval before they write or share news in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">The rules also indicate that registration with full real name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts suspect that this will enable the elimination of anonymous comments in social networks within social networks. up to now, it is unclear how the authorities will apply these rules.</seg>
<seg id="2956">"" "" "" "Chinese citizens have proposed social media to selectively enforce these rules in order to protect citizen journalism and independence." ""</seg>
<seg id="2957">Then do we see ourselves in "WeChat"?</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">In May, the state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"" "according to Roscomnadzor, WeChat devises to register with the state government as" "" "organizer of the dissemination of information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a law from 2014, thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that organize the "Publication of Information." the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for removing content and compel them upon request for the execution of user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These websites are currently websites such as Vcontacts and Odnoplatniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the Image Board 2.ch.hk, the e-mail service mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court decrees Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court ordered the blocking of Wikipedias in Turkey, after Wikipedia-administrators refused to delete two English-language articles, the declarations that Turkey endorse the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">The Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications admitted that the site was locked because they were "a source of information that collaborated with groups in order to seek a political defamation campaign against Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website. it is, among other things, China, one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Britain cannot stop to sniff around</seg>
<seg id="2968">After this week's leaked documents, the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install the Backdoor, which decrypt data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecommunications enterprises and intelligence services regarding the proposal, but has left other technology companies and civilian populations on the outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation runs until May 19. reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
