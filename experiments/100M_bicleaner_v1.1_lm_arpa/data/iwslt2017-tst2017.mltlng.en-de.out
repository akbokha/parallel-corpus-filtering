this is James Ris@@ en .
perhaps you know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times repor@@ ter .
long before someone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published a spectacular article that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally listened to tel@@ eph@@ ones of Americans .
but it is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a disa@@ strous US intelligence operation , in which the CIA literally handed over dra@@ fts to Iran for a nuclear bomb .
if this sounds crazy , read it .
it &apos;s an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter did not like at all ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years , the government has been investigating ris@@ ons and called upon him to name his alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and spy on journalists .
according to the first constitutional review , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right when media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they reveal .
so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many cour@@ a@@ geous repor@@ ters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to jail .
from 2007 to 2015 Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something unusual happened .
suddenly , although they stated years of indication that it would be essential to their case , the government &apos;s demands were dropped to Ris@@ en .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , the repor@@ ters and sources can hide less and less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of ex@@ cre@@ ting and expos@@ ing Ris@@ en , they could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so the investig@@ ators , without his understanding , have secretly listened to his phone notes ,
just like his email data , financial and banking information , his credit information , and even travel cards with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA @-@ W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en &apos;s supposed source .
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers in his attempt to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary has more convic@@ ted than all US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower going to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we put the press on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional additive , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just as government technology allows the government to circum@@ vent the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and they can do so from the moment they contact , rather than in hin@@ d@@ sight , in the witness stand .
today there is communication software that has not yet existed when Ris@@ en had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such technology is a Secure@@ drop , an open @-@ source trans@@ mitt@@ ance system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work .
instead of sending an email , go to a news website , like the one here by the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information , as with any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government cannot obtain more information in secret , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset .
however , Secure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately governments all over the world are developing new sp@@ ying technologies that end@@ anger all of us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is up to us to ensure that not only technology leaders such as Edward Snow@@ den have a possibility to mis@@ lead mis@@ deeds . it is equally important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the supply of soldiers and wants to report of crowded hospitals . or the next environmental worker who suggests an alarm for contaminated water from F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall Street insi@@ ders who warns us before the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes but to protect our all constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that wealthy and powerful &#93; have hidden &#91; enormous sums of money in tax ha@@ v@@ ens &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; this week we were asked about a leak of 11 million documents from the law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a , based in Panama .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up that ? &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works .
this has led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ ig@@ ned .
there are also reports that an ally of Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s brutal Syrian dict@@ ator has ha@@ v@@ ens in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is alleged that a track of $ 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , through a close friend of childhood days , a famous cel@@ list .
now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others waiting nerv@@ ously for the next release , and the next un@@ veiled documents .
now that sounds like the plot of an agent ri@@ ll@@ er or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
it seems to we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should that happen to us ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not to pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that applies to all of us .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
all over the world , media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide and disgu@@ ise their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people are very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ yo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these formations .
it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters .
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports in the US about this matter .
probably because there were no prominent Americans up to now who came to this sc@@ andal in these revelations .
now it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but by the principle of which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a data check from the Cay@@ man Islands or even Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , in some US states , less information is needed to provide less information in order to establish a company than to get a library card .
this type of in@@ transparency in the United States has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed frau@@ d@@ sters to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator called himself an African minister , who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the USA to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really shocked that everyone up to one lawyer made suggestions on how to transfer his money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course nobody was given money to anyone . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as an individual case .
it is not about a single lawyer who submitted proposals to our hidden investig@@ ator .
it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian , involved in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works , through which corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability are established .
and to cope with this , we need to change the rules of the game .
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult .
it may sound sil@@ ly as if we couldn &apos;t do anything against it ; as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I see that things have started to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years we have seen more transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the theme received political attention from British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , the EU has been gathering in central registers at national level , who really is behind firms in Europe and who controls them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
representatives of both parties have introduced a draft law in both parliam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us with Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need ordinary people to be angry when they see other people hiding their true identity behind bog@@ us firms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need managers in the economy who stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end this kind of in@@ transparency by laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together , we can finally end the in@@ transparency which now enables this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ et .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a post shop sale .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he enthusias@@ tically told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Where are you sleeping tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , man !
what can I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace @-@ cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard me say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ah , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what did I get there ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
a wild alien sleeps in my living room .
what if he &apos;s mad ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of bed , sne@@ aked at to@@ e tips to the door , and locked my bedroom door .
but he wasn &apos;t crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
the artwork he bought from me hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
that was my first experience as a host . it changed my point of view completely .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s make a jump , two years later ...
I &apos;m unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate is pulling out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can make it possible to transform fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something about it . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including a mattress and breakfast each morning .
ha ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we created a website and created so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep on the air mattress on wooden floor for 20 dollars .
they found it super , and we too .
I am sure our cheese @-@ ham @-@ om@@ el@@ ettes ta@@ sted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed .
had we just discovered that we found new friends at the same time and could pay our rent ?
things came rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if we could make a business concept out of it .
thus we presented to investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people post public images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors you close when you visit .
through the Internet , they can then invite strange people to stay with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this will be the next big thing ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we waited for the mis@@ sile to ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
no one who is still in sol@@ ace would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you should focus on things that you can do well . we could design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who had never met before .
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree confidence we asp@@ ire to .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
keep your fingers crossed if you are ready .
take your mobile phone in your hand .
now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone .
share your locked mobile phone with your left sitting room@@ mate .
this quiet flight of panic you feel now -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they view your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked mobile of a stranger in your hands ?
most people feel the responsibility .
this is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason can our company exist .
just like that , who actually has Al Gor@@ es mobile ?
could you please announce on Twitter that he is candidate for the Office of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones .
you have now experienced what kind of confidence we want to build up . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail about this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name ; if he told you where he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine that you have 150 jud@@ gements , all say , &quot; He can really hold off very well un@@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone ?
a well thought @-@ through feedback system greatly enhances trust .
in the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to leave negative jud@@ gements .
in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had left their assessments before we placed them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how similar they are regarding age and place of residence .
it is not surprising that we trust the people that are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural bias .
it becomes exciting when you add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by jud@@ gements .
if you have less than three assessments , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation mer@@ ges common ground .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted love .
in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself .
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
if you talk too little , like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; tell too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is rather not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal degree of openness , for example &quot; Great works of art in your apartment ! I &apos;m doing a vacation with my family . &quot;
how can you create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text box to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which subjects to write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces towards strangers .
what we didn &apos;t expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to cut off those prejudi@@ ces .
here you can see how many people take advantage of our offer .
you can see three things .
first : unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third , a demand that had not been met before .
for us the shop is running very well .
of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who have not allowed parties to party or have homes devast@@ ated .
hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with the customer service . all the calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front when trust broke .
there &apos;s nothing worse than those calls . it hur@@ ts when I think about it .
the dis@@ appointment that you hear in the voice of the c@@ aller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million aver@@ aged nights had a problem .
for people trust each other rightly .
when trust works , wonderful things can come about .
one of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attack due to sitting activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save lives , even though they don &apos;t know one at all .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they pass books .
they leave one even longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so , of course , not every stay will exp@@ ire .
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I first stum@@ bled upon this term , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
it is about economic trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but to call it simply &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing is not fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people make part of themselves open , and that changes everything .
when you travel today , you can compare it with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what if travelling would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what if in any place you visit , there would be a group where you would wait for a thorough filling out and show you a pub craw@@ l neighborhood of which you have never heard ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays housing is designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would design apartments from ground up to sharing ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of shared sharing ?
I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
in Seoul &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already started . many parking spaces belonging to the government include :
students who were looking for a place to stay ,
were im@@ par@@ ted to people whose children were moved out . incu@@ b@@ ators were started ,
in order to be able to finance new start @-@ ups in the share economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be a guest of a stranger or even host .
so the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught us .
we didn &apos;t re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
there was also hospitality before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why did it work ?
apart from happiness and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us to overcome deeply rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find it amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da goes past me .
we know , of course , that design cannot solve every problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder why we can use design in the near future .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or oppressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or just a delay at the airport security check .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you blame for your negative impressions .
that &apos;s how the media portra@@ ys people who look like me .
a study found that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that Americans think most wouldn &apos;t know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk about their U@@ ber riders .
for all those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double espresso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a w@@ ann@@ abe fitness fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practicing spiritual Muslim .
but not how Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born that way .
I decided to do that .
when I was 17 years old , I decided to ou@@ ten myself .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the hi@@ j@@ ab my head guard .
my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence for me , compared to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt myself to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted pas@@ sively the faith of my parents .
I have strug@@ gl@@ ed with the Qur &apos;@@ an .
I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was a trust and a slow dedication that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;@@ an .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes makes me cry .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
have you ever felt that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , understands you completely , and yet loves you somehow ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I married and began like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I had a child later , after my marriage , and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then that terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were .
I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast , had breakfast , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking news . &quot;
there was smoke , aircraft flew in buildings , people ran out of the buildings .
what was it ?
an accident ?
a technical distur@@ b@@ ance ?
my shock was quickly transformed into rebellion .
why should you do such a thing ?
I changed the TV channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... , ... &quot; in the name of Islam , &quot; ... , ... &quot; Middle Eastern ... , &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... &quot; ... &quot; Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh my God .
it has not only been attacked by my country , but in the N@@ u the actions of others turned me into a susp@@ ects from a citizen .
the same day we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move into a new city and start the post@@ graduate course .
I remember how I drove -- as we drove in silence -- as deep it went down to my seat , and I was afraid for the first time to be recognized as Muslims .
we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stay in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it was Friday that week -- the day Muslims gather to pray .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard attacks on Muslims or from people who were held for Muslims , literally drag@@ ging and beating .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought we should stay at home .
but something didn &apos;t feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have got the anger of people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was angry too .
it is not easy to constantly explain yourself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
these are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today we can actually hear people say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is a problem in this country -- it is Muslim . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they talk about my church like a tumor in the US body .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know that a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumour in the US &apos;s body , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympic athletes .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
maybe there will be some parking available , but don &apos;t stop the terror .
the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads us to look at people of other fai@@ ths more toler@@ ant and to show greater citizen participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told me : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alized in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
when first , the person is cut off from their church , even from their family so that the extrem@@ ist group can make a bra@@ in@@ washing that causes the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who abh@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ it@@ or or belief .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we must stop people going to the mos@@ que .
some will still claim Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imag@@ inations if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , like the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x clan with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Book &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when looking at them , they do not exagger@@ ate what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Bible &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she pre@@ tended to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was just the opposite . every minister with whom she spoke , brought her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would bring her only into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that would have made sense to their anger , it was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised a solution .
this Ima@@ m restored the connection with God and her church .
instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed her constructive ways for real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an indication of how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia is concerned with me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , to our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we rather accept an author@@ itarian government system , conformity and prejudi@@ ce .
a study shows that when people submit messages in which neg@@ atively reported on Muslims , they rather vo@@ iced military attacks against Muslim countries , as well as the circumc@@ isions of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look at when the mood sw@@ elled against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural response to Muslim terror , as I expected .
it can indeed be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to under@@ mine the foundations of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
perhaps we feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear is har@@ ming us all .
in the allocation of collective guilt , it is not only about having to explain themselves .
De@@ h and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school .
De@@ h was a sports@@ man .
he was talented at the dental faculty , very promising ...
his sister would tell me he was the cut@@ est , most generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was ba@@ ff@@ led and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when has such a young man become such an accomplished young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who visited the afternoon .
he spent eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral but also deadly .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or did we stay safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about which America we wish to leave to our children : one that would control us by fear , or one in which we can exercise our religion freely .
we chose the mos@@ que .
with our son in the child &apos;s seat we drove sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took him out , put off my shoes , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw let me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the congregation were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who had come , not to attack us , but to assist us .
at this moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had preferred courage and compassion to panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be on the safe side ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than that .
thank you very much .
thank you so much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have met a nerve .
but I wonder what would you say to those who might say that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with drau@@ ght , working in a pos@@ h think tank , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ hi@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t fool you . I &apos;m totally normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I &apos;m so ordinary as it is allowed .
looking at the Muslims around the world , and I did that with the greatest study done to Muslims all over the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I &apos;m in no way an exception .
when people seem like an exception to rule , then the rule is often broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you very much . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a billion dollar business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the potential applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research facilities worldwide .
before air @-@ par@@ c@@ els entered our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six @-@ metre @-@ high tower of 1 500 bricks .
by connecting air@@ planes , they reach high speed and acceleration in a confined space .
they can also build self @-@ reli@@ eving structures .
they have learned to bear burdens , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally respond to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in autonomous flight .
in order for a system to operate autonom@@ ously , it must be coll@@ ectively aware of where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , calculate calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available on the highest level e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flying machine trying to beat two flies with a flap .
like other Star@@ r@@ flü@@ g@@ ler , it is efficient in the forward flight , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations .
in contrast to most star@@ ters , it can lev@@ itate , and thus has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of rear star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind this is that the flight unit doesn &apos;t matter in what location the optimum position is recovered and the performance can be improved by practi@@ sing .
okay . OK .
during our research , we often face fundamental abstract questions , which advance to the core of the matter .
for example , such a question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known to be machines with thousands of moving parts that meet to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remote controlled aircraft that had only two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying with only one works .
this is the Mon@@ osp@@ a , the mechanically most remote controlled flight device . it was invented recently .
it only has a movable part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross ru@@ des , no further actuators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechanically simple , inside the interior very much happens so that it can fly stable and move everywhere in the room .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear star@@ ters . to make it fly , I have to throw it correctly .
the chance to accurately throw it right when all watch me is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night .
if the Mon@@ osp@@ a is an exercise in cont@@ ent@@ ment , this machine is here , the Omni@@ head with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only sym@@ metric .
therefore it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
as a result , he receives the extraordinary ability ,
move in the room in all directions , no matter what direction it is turned or even like it rot@@ ates .
of course it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some are imagin@@ able in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let &apos;s look at it .
when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they need to be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate two prop@@ eller aircraft .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other counter @-@ clock@@ wise .
when you build them together they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
but if something goes wrong -- an engine or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue flying even if restricted .
we will demonstrate this by making half f@@ light@@ less .
the last demonstration is investigating synthetic heat .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression .
we took standard micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter - each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ ps them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the especially safe machine over there would like to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology .
for types like us , wages are in development and creative activity .
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such a massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed around each other in a very remote gal@@ axy , transforming the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second .
this short moment they lit more brigh@@ tly than all stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the whole of us known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not release their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into the space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded into gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us first arrange the events in time .
more than 1.3 billion years ago , multi @-@ cell life was created on Earth .
since then the earth has produced some things : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God stands at us -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of especially cour@@ a@@ geous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from the MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravit@@ ational @-@ waves , which are caused by colli@@ ding black holes .
most people thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy genius , so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of development , design , design and extremely hard work , they built the detector Lig@@ o : the Laser Inter@@ fer@@ ometer Wave Observ@@ atory .
in the following period , the precision of Lig@@ o could be increased significantly , which greatly improved the recognition performance .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o now .
beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a last test run to solve some minor stub@@ born problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gravit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes controlled through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of my Dau@@ ghter
and the f@@ arewell to my to@@ dd@@ ling father .
in essence , these were the fruits of my life .
all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gravit@@ ational waves of black holes for 23 years and their signals meas@@ urable by observ@@ atories such as lig@@ o .
a wave of gravity is a cr@@ amp in the structure of space and time .
when over@@ laying the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and put into the other .
for illustr@@ ative teachers , instructors in theory of rel@@ ativity often perform a properly al@@ ber@@ y dance .
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
the problem is that gravit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and smo@@ ked at the arrival of the waves . the el@@ on@@ gation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 .
with a five @-@ kilomet@@ re laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured on less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nucle@@ us . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classical text about gravity
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the waves as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties of building such detectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will certainly be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
go back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell .
this is quite practical , because so you can customize a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from several points around you .
in the case of sounds , this is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that are particularly important to you :
about the face of your child .
instead we listen to certain properties , such as pitch and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alice is talking now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob is breaking them down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; du@@ mmer Bob . &quot;
the same applies for gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple images of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o , the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe speak .
listening to the gravity can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has occupied himself very long .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , simply circular : w@@ up@@ p !
twi@@ sting the two bodies very quickly one hears the same chir@@ p with an additional key change . that sounds like : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed in the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render sound &#93; Som@@ e@@ one who knows what to hear will recognize this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 times solar mass , which turn around as fast as the rods of your mixer .
AA : let &apos;s consider what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , circle around hundred times a second before they colli@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know it because we heard it .
therein lies the abi@@ ding meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a whole new way to resear@@ ching the universe , as it has never been possible before .
on this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
much in space , we can &apos;t see -- virtually or fundamentally -- not .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ie stars explo@@ de in super nov@@ as .
they are very useful . we learned a lot from them about the universe .
the exciting physical processes happen , however , in the nucle@@ us hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never go through because these are op@@ a@@ que .
gravit@@ ational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe ins@@ an@@ ely , but we will never see it since the Big B@@ ang is obsc@@ ured by its own after@@ glow .
with the help of gravit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and that is most important : I am optim@@ istic that all things exist that we have never seen before , which we will never see and of which we have no idea at all . things we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt we had not expected .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this subject : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , like Lig@@ o , they are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies of pre@@ historic times . the black holes are , so to speak , the s@@ mu@@ g bones for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different angle of view on what happened in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately how we came out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge is to be as cour@@ a@@ geous as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of big dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I experim@@ ented with an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into uncomfortable situations , I forced myself to say yes .
did I want to speak in public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start playing the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I feared , removed my fear .
my fear to hold speeches , my social anxiety -- exhau@@ sts , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , &quot; my life has changed .
&quot; yes , &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply to an unexpected kind . it began with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons , &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my be@@ ak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she once asked her if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this yes was the beginning
a new attitude to life in my family . from then on , I s@@ wore to always play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , on our family .
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; say for playing with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am a writer . I think of things , awaken you to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I created television . I produce television .
I &apos;m making television , in a grand style .
in this season , I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours tel@@ ev@@ isions . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each show offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can lie between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode all nine days four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollar television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three programs simultaneously in production , once four , 16 episodes : sc@@ andal@@ ous , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series are running one after the other on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series are running in 256 different languages in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are programs I have created myself , and not only produced , so on top of it . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around camp@@ fire and to tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires burning around the world .
do you know who is doing this ?
no one , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you that all of you who work so hard whether you are managing a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a home , take me seriously if I talk about work so that you understand that I &apos;m not just typing on the computer and f@@ anci@@ ful , and it is true when I say : I understand that it doesn &apos;t dream about a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I &apos;m immersed in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a land out of nowhere .
it is as if I set up troops , as I painted on a screen .
as if you were wearing a high tone , run a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
she is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing about it is hum@@ ming .
there is such a change in me when the work is going well .
a bu@@ zz@@ ing begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz@@ ing sounds like a busy road , I could drive on it forever .
many people accept when I explain to them the bu@@ zz@@ ing that I &apos;m talking about writing that writing gives me joy .
don &apos;t get me wrong , it does .
but the bu@@ zz@@ ing -- when I began working with TV production when I began to work and make , build , create and work together , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz@@ ing , this energy .
sum@@ ming is more than writing .
bu@@ zz@@ ing is action and activity . the bu@@ zz@@ ing is a drug .
hum@@ ming is music . hum@@ ming is light and air .
hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz@@ ing , you can &apos;t strive for great@@ ness .
the feeling of not being able to be different than to strive for size no matter what price .
this is called sums .
or maybe it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is called genius .
maybe it &apos;s ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I just know that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I just know that I love hum@@ ming .
I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make one thing clear : the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more crowded borders , the more work there are , the more things I write , the more I write history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high clay , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
I like this bu@@ zz@@ ing . I love the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
I need the sums . I am the sum .
am I just this bu@@ zz@@ ing ?
and then the tot@@ als stopped .
over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ loaded , over@@ stated , burned out .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their m@@ um is one single work subject .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um won &apos;t be there , but you can write to my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da Land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the bu@@ zz@@ ing ceased .
the engine bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
I didn &apos;t love my job any more . the engine was off .
the tot@@ als did not come back .
my bu@@ zz@@ ing was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , no deleg@@ ate , a titanium is not asleep , does not give up , with all the heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no bu@@ zz@@ ing .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a flagship Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no more fun .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the tot@@ als and the tot@@ als I was .
so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly fa@@ des ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lo@@ y yourself , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know , you do it , you do , you &apos;re working , you love being a teacher , being a bank@@ ers , being a mo@@ m , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love someone else and that gives to one the bu@@ zz@@ ing when you know the bu@@ zz@@ ing when the bu@@ zz@@ ing stops , who is one then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; southern wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late , and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I already want to say no when I am aware of two things :
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , I must say yes to all and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she doesn &apos;t call anyone any more &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot;
when is this happening ?
I miss it when I &apos;m Titan and grab my bu@@ zz , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing special about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of bo@@ asting , I can &apos;t do anything except to watch out .
I am focused .
I am silent .
the land I created , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons , and the song in which it is about letting go , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door opens and an energy boost enters .
and that doesn &apos;t happen immediately , but it happens it happens .
I feel it .
the tot@@ als are coming back slowly .
no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the bu@@ zz@@ ing , but a bu@@ zz@@ ing .
and now I feel like I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no mystery . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
hum@@ ming , hum@@ ming , titanium dioxide , that &apos;s just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I describe TV shows and how dys@@ functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz@@ ing is .
hum@@ ming is not a force and it is not specific to work .
it depends on the pleasure .
the real bu@@ zz@@ ing depends on the love .
hum@@ ming is the current that comes from the z@@ est of life .
the real bu@@ zz@@ ing is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real bu@@ zz@@ ing ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be completed , the expectation and the pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real bu@@ zz@@ ing is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words to me , for which God told me I &apos;m a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I &apos;m doing this as a rule so that I can free myself from all guilt as a work@@ ah@@ olic .
it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice unless I want to hear the bu@@ zz again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing isn &apos;t just the way I work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work , because I love it .
I prefer working at the workplace than at home .
this admission is painful , because what kind of man is better than being at home ?
well , I .
hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I &apos;m too relaxed is none of them .
we race around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
at the same time , I feel overwhel@@ m@@ ingly stiff , absent and confused .
I always take my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the tot@@ als of the universe fulfilled me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also say yes if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you think me na@@ ï@@ ve for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you &apos;re right there , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they &apos;re not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else .
there are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bug or bis@@ cuit replaces me .
and my teen@@ ie @-@ daughter speaks with me for a whole 15 minutes , I am mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , there is no need for more .
everyone can spend 15 minutes on the track , even at a bad mood day !
15 minutes a day !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to pray .
but 15 minutes are in it !
my children are my oasis of well @-@ being , my world . it is not necessary to be the children . it is important to feel the bu@@ zz@@ ing , to have a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and keep it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;ll fail and I &apos;ll be victorious . meeting friends , reading books , enjoying the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in my training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes on the track , why not treat yourself for 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz@@ ing came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz@@ ing seems to return when I don &apos;t work .
working does not work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself again in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the bu@@ zz@@ ing , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing isn &apos;t me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my bu@@ zz@@ ing .
the tot@@ als of life .
the tot@@ als of love .
the sum of the work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful for that .
it is to me that I &apos;m a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel like a good mother .
the more I play , the clearer my head is .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the bu@@ zz@@ ing . the land I create , the marathon I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high clay , the sums , the sums , the other , the right sums : the bu@@ zz@@ ing of life .
the more I feel this bu@@ zz@@ ing , the more this unusual , dying , bare and new feeling of life in me becomes wide . less titanium -- more I !
the more I feel this bu@@ zz@@ ing , the more I know who I am .
I am a writer . I think of things , I &apos;ll awaken you to life .
this is part of the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a bit dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to another after a serious stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low self @-@ healing capability .
after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent disability .
this is probably the reason why I became a functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional Neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nervous functions through various surgical techniques .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they certainly have heard of one of the best known , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depth brain stimulation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one im@@ planted a electrode deep in the brain to influence the neur@@ ons &apos; circuits so that the neuro@@ logical function improved . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease , suffering from severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story started 15 years ago .
at that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
often I provided patients with cran@@ ial brain trauma .
you have to imagine that in the case of cran@@ ial @-@ brain @-@ trau@@ mas , the brain will be s@@ wollen and the cran@@ ial pressure increases .
in order to save life , it is necessary to reduce the pressure of the cran@@ ium .
sometimes you have to remove a part of a s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , to analyse the brain mass .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to make cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
allowing cells to grow from a tissue is comparable to very small children that are taken out of their families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and the environment to thri@@ ve .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François managed to succeed .
he saw this under his micro@@ scope .
that was a great surprise for us .
why ?
it looked just like a stem cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you still know from the biology lesson that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they were divided slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new strange cell population that looked like stem cells but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they are made up of 4 % of our brain @-@ brain cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fet@@ us they care for the folding of the brain .
but why do they get us ?
we don &apos;t know that .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain as we find them at higher concentrations near brain injuries .
but this is not so secure .
one thing is clear , however -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
we are in front of a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non @-@ language area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and then select colors to be able to trace them in the brain .
in the last step we re @-@ imported them at the point of departure of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- auto@@ graph transplan@@ t .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we reim@@ ported these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we reim@@ ported the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario , we reim@@ proved the cells in a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed again , they go back home .
in the second scenario we inflic@@ ted an injury and reim@@ proved exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we were able to observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been re @-@ imported .
the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells that we dy@@ e in vitro , in culture .
of course we couldn &apos;t stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take pellets from a tray .
they made it very good .
when they reached a stable level of dex@@ ter@@ ity , we injured the motor skills range in the motor Cor@@ tex .
after that the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand any more .
just as it would happen in humans , they spontaneously recovered up to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to some extent , just like the monkeys .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left you see the monkey , who recovered spontaneously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from prior to injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
see now when we reim@@ ported the cells : the same monkey , two months after the implantation .
I can tell you that these were very exciting results for us as well .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze it and use it later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to implant them in humans .
I really hope that I will soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bruno Giuss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical trials on humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results , you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies .
BG : that &apos;s understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first of all , it depends on the clinical study &apos;s approval .
will it allow us the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply it to a multic@@ enter study .
first you have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it &apos;s safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for your visit to TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that it actually is , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them un@@ changeable .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
democracy is in fact d@@ wind@@ ling with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- it was unmistak@@ ably clear to me as the finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- will not affect the austerity programs that have been implemented in Greece .
at that moment , I thought there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , or the Communist Party of China , or some of my rebel@@ li@@ ous friends who told me that democracy would be aboli@@ shed if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to present you an economic model for true democracy .
I ask you , along with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group are mistaken , we could save ourselves the democracy , but that we need a tru@@ thful and defensive democracy .
for without democracy , our societies are dark@@ ened , our future glo@@ omy and our great , new technologies are wa@@ sted .
on the subject of extravag@@ ance I would like to point out to you an interesting contradiction that currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin @-@ summit parad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a peak is known to you . you know and recognize it as the debt mountain which casts its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognise the mountain of debt ,
yet few recognize his twin .
a mountain of unused cash that belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations , which , however , are too anxi@@ ous to invest in where it would be productive and income that could produce the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs , for example green energy .
I call them two numbers .
in the past three months , 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars have been invested in the USA , in England and in the euro@@ zone , in all the prosperity of producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so forth .
3.@@ 4@@ tri@@ l@@ lion US dollar sounds like a lot of money until it compar@@ es with the $ 5.1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollar , which at the same time runs in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did nothing to infl@@ ate the stock markets and raise real estate prices .
thus debt and un@@ productive capital are the twin peaks , which are not offset by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe out of work , and consequently a low macro@@ economic demand that , as in a continuous loop , advoc@@ ates the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , in which they do not invest .
invol@@ un@@ tarily comes the circumstances that cause the body to kill it .
this is my hatred with capitalism --
&quot; &quot; &quot; his extremely wast@@ eful art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and to finance all the technologies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies which are decisive for the rescue of the earth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy naturally concluded too many --
women , foreigners , and of course , slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of ath@@ en@@ ic democracy on the grounds of these exclu@@ sions .
the decisive factor in the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it embra@@ ced the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but is more important and decisive that it gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal weight in questions of state interference .
Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not lasted long --
like a candle that g@@ lows very brigh@@ tly , it is also quickly burned out .
however , today &apos;s liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies have not rooted their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which in the end was a statute for rulers .
for liberal democracy only emerged when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- thus the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone .
in our demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation from politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle took place between the two by gradually under@@ mining the economy and ex@@ toll@@ ing it .
do you wonder why the politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not due to degeneration of their DNA .
it is because you can be in the government these days , and yet not in power , because the power has moved away from politics into the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my shar@@ k with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is about like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es , which so sustain@@ ably decim@@ ated the animals from which it nour@@ ishes , decim@@ ated them at the end .
similarly , it is with the economy that has har@@ med politics so far that it hur@@ ts itself through the self @-@ created economic crisis itself . the power of corporations is growing , political goods are being de@@ valued , the disp@@ arity increases , the aggregate demand falls and the directors of the corporations are too anxi@@ ous to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; from democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind .
if that is true , it is obvious that we must re@@ unite the policy and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; maintain control , as in ancient Athens , except for the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist Left already had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go very well .
the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only reg@@ ain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new kinds of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : aboli@@ sh the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers through automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation lets the twin peaks become higher , the waste is more subli@@ me , and the social conflicts lower , as it is -- very soon , as I believe -- in countries like China .
so we need to re@@ organize the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re @-@ unified area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological monitoring hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; matrix &quot; appear like a documentary .
the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements which he has produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that of &quot; matrix , &quot; or something similar to society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines are used in the research of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long talks to indul@@ ge in the meaning of life .
I think we can be optim@@ istic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so what would it be like to have this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples in brief .
in the field of companies : please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which you are currently working -- is the property of those currently working in the company .
then all in@@ comes derive from capital and from revenue and the concept of wage labor is completely over@@ taken .
no distinction between those who belong to the company but who do not work in it , and employees who work there , but which the company does not belong to . no more pi@@ geons between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no rising twin peaks .
in the field of global political economy , please briefly imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all humanity .
suppose that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum equivalent to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund .
imagine that this fund is investing in green technology , particularly in parts of the world where investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John Ma@@ yn@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed at the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we have it , especially against the background of a re@@ united politics and economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world I describe you is simultaneously liberal , in which they prefer privileged individuals , and Mar@@ xi@@ an because it will have buried the separation of capital and labor in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and Key@@ nesi@@ an , globally Key@@ nesi@@ an .
but above all else it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy .
will we awaken in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide politically together .
it is in our hands and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno Giuss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything that I just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economics is ... Do we not do this , technological development will create such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which is called Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers as a &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we experience it , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant ,
as well as Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I &apos;m totally confused .
BG : in fact , and now we are .
Y@@ V : if you &apos;re not confused you don &apos;t think about it enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who said that . BG : in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the or@@ ators you have clearly said what you think of the West &apos;s view of China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the impression of democracy .
as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays out -- the sphere of economy -- is a fully democratic zone .
in a sense , when I can say so pro@@ voc@@ atively , China is similar to England of the 19th century .
because -- remember -- we tend to link liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake historically regarded .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill
he was particularly scep@@ tical about democratic development .
what can now be observed in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China is now propos@@ ing to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ ells of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as the Finance Minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I sen@@ sed that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you return to the first half of the year six months later ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to start a new start with the euro@@ zone ,
not only Greece but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to say good to ourselves from compl@@ ac@@ ency and continuous den@@ ial that a massive fault line has passed through the euro@@ zone and continues to thre@@ aten the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which was , by the way , the first proposal that revealed this den@@ ial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro zone , within the Euro@@ group , have continued to choose the den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if one tries to maintain an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , one might be able to delay it for a while , but when the changes occur , it will happen ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone who looks back -- Seri@@ ous ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is a finance minister or any minister who holds office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he claims he did not make any mistakes , then it is a dangerous person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the side of the len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but that didn &apos;t exist .
they merely wanted to bring our government down , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that went through the euro@@ zone .
they did not want to admit that they had been conducting a disa@@ strous programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ ika , who imposed this policy on us , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of the talks , you seem to be even more pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if they do not survive , the released escap@@ ees will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to pursue the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 what it seems to me , it will also be det@@ ri@@ mental to the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you will be wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being at TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
Roy Price has never heard most , although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a hed@@ geho@@ g and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Techni@@ que , Tac@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course , this is a highly competitive sector .
there are so many TV shows that Roy can &apos;t choose any one .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are on the very right of this corner .
this curve is the assessment of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this review .
if your show is valued at nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive to where , after you saw a relay , your brain asks : &quot; where are more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to forbi@@ d &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the medium size , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t enth@@ use .
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
the print is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing such a thing , so Roy Price does not want to risk anything .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses from an evaluation eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online , where everyone can watch them for free .
and if Amazon leaves things for nothing , do you attack correctly ?
millions of spectators watch these episodes .
however , they do not know that they are observed when watching the shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you collect when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you skip or check again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and hence the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can U.S. Sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good .
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so slightly above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different .
instead of hosting a competition , he and his team looked at the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the ratings they give the shows , the course of which shows they like , etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , what producers , what actors .
when they had all the parts together they went in a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit with it , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; house of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets a 9.1 comment on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , the question now is : what has happened here ?
one has two very competitive , data experienced companies .
they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this about ?
because the logic somehow states that it should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data for a decision you make , then you should make a good decision .
one has 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis doesn &apos;t work , then this is a little frigh@@ tening because we live in a time when we take more and more to statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems here ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software . come into contact with it , you are in prison .
if someone is in prison here in the US and asks for release , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , is
not always the best results are generated . this is not because a company such as multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
even the most experienced companies are wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that through data analysis , they could predict out@@ breaks of flu , the aw@@ ful way -- through data analysis of Google searches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it worked flaw@@ lessly , year by year , until it suddenly stopped working ,
and nobody could say why .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it just didn &apos;t work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the most experienced companies like Amazon and Google mis@@ understand something sometimes .
despite all these errors , data increasingly flows into decisions of life -- at work , in the enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics - an area where some very smart people use uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably many data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for a cancer therapy .
over the years , I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
first , dis@@ assemble this problem in its components so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a second , you put the components together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : taking apart and putting together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to disman@@ tle a problem and to understand its parts .
they are not suitable for putting the parts together again and then coming to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all possess it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to compose pieces and pieces again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
that &apos;s why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and mind where they belong also in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they wouldn &apos;t have been able to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; was not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant that they took a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first as they competing for TV ideas , then selecting &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what the data tells us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I think things are going wrong when data start controlling our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just one tool , and in order not to forget this , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a hunting or no question , you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will get it out later with a technical demo .
so far I have made some decisions in my life , and I should have listened to the ball afterwards .
however , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it with a little more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so maybe the ball will be smar@@ ter and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right corner .
and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions , be an expert in what you are doing and taking risks .
because in the end it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
