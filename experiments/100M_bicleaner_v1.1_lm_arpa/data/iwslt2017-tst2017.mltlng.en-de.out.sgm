<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">Perhaps you know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published a spectacular article that the NSA illegally listened to telephones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a disastrous US intelligence operation, in which the CIA literally handed over drafts to Iran for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If this sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter did not like at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government has been investigating risons and called upon him to name his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern to condemn whistleblower and spy on journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the first constitutional review, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right when media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they reveal.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to jail.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015 Risen lived with the risk of going to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something unusual happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they stated years of indication that it would be essential to their case, the government's demands were dropped to Risen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, the reporters and sources can hide less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "instead of excreting and exposing Risen, they could also do his digital footprints for him." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his understanding, have secretly listened to his phone notes,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his email data, financial and banking information, his credit information, and even travel cards with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-Whistleblower and Risen's supposed source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers in his attempt to protect whistleblower, but instead the judiciary has more convicted than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower going to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "so we put the press on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional additive, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as government technology allows the government to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And they can do so from the moment they contact, rather than in hindsight, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there is communication software that has not yet existed when Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is a Securedrop, an open-source transmittance system for whistleblower originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news website, like the one here by the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, as with any usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot obtain more information in secret, and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately governments all over the world are developing new spying technologies that endanger all of us.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "it is up to us to ensure that not only technology leaders such as Edward Snowden have a possibility to mislead misdeeds. it is equally important that we protect the next whistleblower," ""</seg>
<seg id="39">Who knows about grievances in the supply of soldiers and wants to report of crowded hospitals. or the next environmental worker who suggests an alarm for contaminated water from Flint. or a Wall Street insiders who warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes but to protect our all constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[the "Panama Papers" revealed that wealthy and powerful] have hidden [enormous sums of money in tax havens] [what does this mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] this week we were asked about a leak of 11 million documents from the law firm Mossack Fonseca, based in Panama.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up that?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of Bashar al-Assad's brutal Syrian dictator has havens in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is alleged that a track of $2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, through a close friend of childhood days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of richer people out there and others waiting nervously for the next release, and the next unveiled documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of an agent riller or a John-Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems to weep away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should that happen to us?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax havens and not to pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that applies to all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">All over the world, media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and disguise their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people are very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matryoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these formations.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters.</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports in the US about this matter.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there were no prominent Americans up to now who came to this scandal in these revelations.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their wealth in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle of which these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data check from the Cayman Islands or even Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, in some US states, less information is needed to provide less information in order to establish a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the United States has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed fraudsters to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator called himself an African minister, who wanted to bring suspicious money to the USA to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "we really shocked that everyone up to one lawyer made suggestions on how to transfer his money." ""</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course nobody was given money to anyone. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who submitted proposals to our hidden investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single top politician, involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, through which corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability are established.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we need to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">It may sound silly as if we couldn't do anything against it; as if nothing had ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I see that things have started to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"" "" "" "over the past few years we have seen more transparency regarding the owners of companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme received political attention from British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"" "" "" "since then, the EU has been gathering in central registers at national level, who really is behind firms in Europe and who controls them." ""</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have introduced a draft law in both parliamentarians, but this does not make the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us with Global Witness, this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">"" "" "" "we need ordinary people to be angry when they see other people hiding their true identity behind bogus firms." ""</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need managers in the economy who stand up and say:" "" "transparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end this kind of intransparency by laws." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "together, we can finally end the intransparency which now enables this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazet.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a post shop sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he enthusiastically told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "as we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him," "" "Where are you sleeping tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought, "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What can I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace-corps, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard me say," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "Ah, how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">"" "at night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought," "" "Oh man! what did I get there?" ""</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild alien sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he's mad? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I went out of bed, sneaked at toe tips to the door, and locked my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he wasn't crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork he bought from me hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as a host. it changed my point of view completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">When I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's make a jump, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I'm unemployed, almost broke, my roommate is pulling out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can make it possible to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could earn something about it. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk including a mattress and breakfast each morning.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "we created a website and created so" "" "air mattress and breakfast" "" "[AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb]." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep on the air mattress on wooden floor for 20 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure our cheese-ham-omelettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them throughout the city. when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I stared.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we found new friends at the same time and could pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if we could make a business concept out of it.</seg>
<seg id="138">Thus we presented to investors: "we want to create a website where people post public images of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors you close when you visit.</seg>
<seg id="139">Through the Internet, they can then invite strange people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "this will be the next big thing!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still in solace would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you should focus on things that you can do well. we could design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of what degree confidence we aspire to.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Keep your fingers crossed if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone in your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Share your locked mobile phone with your left sitting roommate.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet flight of panic you feel now -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they view your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked mobile of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most people feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">This is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just like that, who actually has Al Gores mobile?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce on Twitter that he is candidate for the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of confidence we want to build up. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail about this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name; if he told you where he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine that you have 150 judgements, all say, "He can really hold off very well unlocked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">A well thought-through feedback system greatly enhances trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to leave negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had left their assessments before we placed them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how similar they are regarding age and place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">It is not surprising that we trust the people that are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It becomes exciting when you add a person's call -- in our case by judgements.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three assessments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation merges common ground.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted love.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If you talk too little, like "Hi!," you don't get an answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "tell too much, for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother" "" "-- -- the request is rather not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, for example "Great works of art in your apartment! I'm doing a vacation with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text box to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which subjects to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices towards strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we didn't expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to cut off those prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people take advantage of our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: unbelievably good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a demand that had not been met before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the shop is running very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed parties to party or have homes devastated.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked with the customer service. all the calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front when trust broke.</seg>
<seg id="206">There's nothing worse than those calls. it hurts when I think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the caller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million averaged nights had a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trust each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust works, wonderful things can come about.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"" "" "" "perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attack due to sitting activities." ""</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives, even though they don't know one at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they pass books.</seg>
<seg id="220">They leave one even longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So, of course, not every stay will expire.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I first stumbled upon this term, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is about economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but to call it simply" "" "rental industry" "", "the thing is not fair." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People make part of themselves open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel today, you can compare it with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in any place you visit, there would be a group where you would wait for a thorough filling out and show you a pub crawl neighborhood of which you have never heard;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays housing is designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments from ground up to sharing?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of shared sharing?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships instead of loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In Seoul's capital Seoul, this project has already started. many parking spaces belonging to the government include:</seg>
<seg id="240">Students who were looking for a place to stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were imparted to people whose children were moved out. incubators were started,</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to be able to finance new start-ups in the share economy. over our platform alone, 785,000 people in 191 countries will be a guest of a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We didn't reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">There was also hospitality before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did it work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us to overcome deeply rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find it amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda goes past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, that design cannot solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder why we can use design in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or just a delay at the airport security check.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">That's how the media portrays people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that Americans think most wouldn't know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk about their Uber riders.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A wannabe fitness fanatic,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not how Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born that way.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do that.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old, I decided to outen myself.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear the hijab my head guard.</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were horrified: "why do you suppress yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence for me, compared to the pressure I felt as 17-year-old to adapt myself to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted passively the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have struggled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, questioned, doubted and ultimately believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>

<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast, had breakfast, looked at the screen and saw the word "breaking news."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, aircraft flew in buildings, people ran out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was it?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disturbance?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock was quickly transformed into rebellion.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should you do such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="299">I changed the TV channel and heard:... "Muslim terrorists...,..." in the name of Islam, "...,..." Middle Eastern..., "..." Jihad... "..." Mecca! "</seg>

<seg id="303">I remember how I drove -- as we drove in silence -- as deep it went down to my seat, and I was afraid for the first time to be recognized as Muslims.</seg>

<seg id="312">I thought we should stay at home.</seg>

<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to ban Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They talk about my church like a tumor in the US body.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know that a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Like all other Americans, Muslims are not a tumour in the US's body, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympic athletes.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">Maybe there will be some parking available, but don't stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads us to look at people of other faiths more tolerant and to show greater citizen participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told me: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalized in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">When first, the person is cut off from their church, even from their family so that the extremist group can make a brainwashing that causes the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or belief.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop people going to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imaginations if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam, like the Ku-Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">"" "both groups claim their ideology on their" "" "Holy Book" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but when looking at them, they do not exaggerate what they read in their" "" "Holy Bible" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was just the opposite. every minister with whom she spoke, brought her to silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would bring her only into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that would have made sense to their anger, it was a major goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam restored the connection with God and her church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed her constructive ways for real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an indication of how the Islamophobia is concerned with me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24 hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, to our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows that when people submit messages in which negatively reported on Muslims, they rather voiced military attacks against Muslim countries, as well as the circumcisions of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look at when the mood swelled against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural response to Muslim terror, as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can indeed be a tool to manipulate the public to undermine the foundations of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">Perhaps we feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear is harming us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the allocation of collective guilt, it is not only about having to explain themselves.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deh and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school.</seg>

<seg id="372">His sister would tell me he was the cutest, most generous person she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was baffled and said:</seg>

<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or did we stay safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about which America we wish to leave to our children: one that would control us by fear, or one in which we can exercise our religion freely.</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the child's seat we drove silently, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, put off my shoes, went into the prayer hall, and what I saw let me stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the congregation were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who had come, not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had preferred courage and compassion to panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose in the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>

<seg id="396">But I wonder what would you say to those who might say that you are holding a TEDTalk, a thinker with draught, working in a posh think tank, so an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Moghied: I would say, don't fool you. I'm totally normal.</seg>

<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I'm in no way an exception.</seg>

<seg id="407">What started as a platform for hobbyists is about to become a billion dollar business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the potential applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research facilities worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air-parcels entered our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the Frac Centre in France built a six-metre-high tower of 1 500 bricks.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting airplanes, they reach high speed and acceleration in a confined space.</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build self-relieving structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to bear burdens, deal with turbulence and generally respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to operate autonomously, it must be collectively aware of where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, calculate calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available on the highest level e. g." "" "start" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flying machine trying to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other Starrflügler, it is efficient in the forward flight, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most starters, it can levitate, and thus has great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence such as wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind this is that the flight unit doesn't matter in what location the optimum position is recovered and the performance can be improved by practising.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay. OK.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often face fundamental abstract questions, which advance to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">For example, such a question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known to be machines with thousands of moving parts that meet to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remote controlled aircraft that had only two moving parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the Monospa, the mechanically most remote controlled flight device. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It only has a movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and cross rudes, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, inside the interior very much happens so that it can fly stable and move everywhere in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear starters. to make it fly, I have to throw it correctly.</seg>
<seg id="441">The chance to accurately throw it right when all watch me is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the Monospa is an exercise in contentment, this machine is here, the Omnihead with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetric.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result, he receives the extraordinary ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Move in the room in all directions, no matter what direction it is turned or even like it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some are imaginable in models, the rest is learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at it.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they need to be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other counter-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them together they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">But if something goes wrong -- an engine or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue flying even if restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this by making half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration is investigating synthetic heat.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took standard micro-quadcopter - each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equips them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations will motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The especially safe machine over there would like to be a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, wages are in development and creative activity.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such a massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled around each other in a very remote galaxy, transforming the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment they lit more brightly than all stars together in all galaxies of the whole of us known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not release their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into the space-time structure itself and the universe exploded into gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us first arrange the events in time.</seg>
<seg id="476">More than 1.3 billion years ago, multi-cell life was created on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has produced some things: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God stands at us -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of especially courageous -- Rai Weiss from the MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational-waves, which are caused by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most people thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy genius, so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, design and extremely hard work, they built the detector Ligo: the Laser Interferometer Wave Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following period, the precision of Ligo could be increased significantly, which greatly improved the recognition performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo now.</seg>
<seg id="484">Beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a last test run to solve some minor stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two colliding black holes controlled through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of my Daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell to my toddling father.</seg>
<seg id="491">In essence, these were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I had worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves of black holes for 23 years and their signals measurable by observatories such as ligo.</seg>
<seg id="493">A wave of gravity is a cramp in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When overlaying the shaft, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and put into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustrative teachers, instructors in theory of relativity often perform a properly albery dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, each of us was stretched and smoked at the arrival of the waves. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometre laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be measured on less than a thousandth of the radius of a nucleus. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">"" "Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the waves as follows:" "" "the technical difficulties of building such detectors are enormous." ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will certainly be overcome." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Go back to Ligo. Scott likes to say that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, because so you can customize a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light coming from several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">In the case of sounds, this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that are particularly important to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain properties, such as pitch and height, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "Alice is talking now." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"" "" "" "and Bob is breaking them down." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"dummer Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies for gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple images of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo, the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe speak.</seg>
<seg id="522">Listening to the gravity can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has occupied himself very long.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, simply circular: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Twisting the two bodies very quickly one hears the same chirp with an additional key change. that sounds like: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget -- Ligo heard the following: [Surrender sound] Someone who knows what to hear will recognize this as sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30 times solar mass, which turn around as fast as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's consider what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circle around hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know it because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the abiding meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a whole new way to researching the universe, as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space, we can't see -- virtually or fundamentally -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why masserie stars explode in super novas.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we learned a lot from them about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes happen, however, in the nucleus hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through because these are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe insanely, but we will never see it since the Big Bang is obscured by its own afterglow.</seg>
<seg id="541">With the help of gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And that is most important: I am optimistic that all things exist that we have never seen before, which we will never see and of which we have no idea at all. things we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found things right in the first attempt we had not expected.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this subject: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, like Ligo, they are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are, so to speak, the smug bones for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo gives us a completely different angle of view on what happened in space, the emergence of the stars and ultimately how we came out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of big dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I experimented with an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for one year I would say" "" "Yes!" "" "I was afraid of." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if it made me nervous, brought me into uncomfortable situations, I forced myself to say yes.</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak in public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: to do exactly what I feared, removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear to hold speeches, my social anxiety -- exhausts, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes," my life has changed.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes," changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply to an unexpected kind. it began with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all" "" "kitten" "" "for inexplicable reasons," ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "kittens, I need milk for my beak." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">"" "she once asked her if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude to life in my family. from then on, I swore to always play with them as soon as you ask me. no matter what I'm doing, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I'm very tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, my children, on our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I fully understood that the "yes" say for playing with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am a writer. I think of things, awaken you to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I created television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I'm making television, in a grand style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this season, I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours televisions. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each show offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode all nine days four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollar television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three programs simultaneously in production, once four, 16 episodes: scandalous, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series are running one after the other on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series are running in 256 different languages in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are programs I have created myself, and not only produced, so on top of it. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around campfire and to tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four television series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is doing this?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, that's why I'm a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">"" "I say it because I know what you think when the word" "" "author" "" "falls." ""</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you that all of you who work so hard whether you are managing a company, a country or a classroom, a business or a home, take me seriously if I talk about work so that you understand that I'm not just typing on the computer and fanciful, and it is true when I say: I understand that it doesn't dream about a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I'm immersed in the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a land out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is as if I set up troops, as I painted on a screen.</seg>
<seg id="608">As if you were wearing a high tone, run a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">She is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing about it is humming.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzzing begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzzing sounds like a busy road, I could drive on it forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people accept when I explain to them the buzzing that I'm talking about writing that writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't get me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the buzzing -- when I began working with TV production when I began to work and make, build, create and work together, I discovered this thing, this buzzing, this energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">Summing is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">Buzzing is action and activity. the buzzing is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">Humming is music. humming is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">Humming is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a buzzing, you can't strive for greatness.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of not being able to be different than to strive for size no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it's ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I just know that I'm not made for failure, and I just know that I love humming.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make one thing clear: the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more crowded borders, the more work there are, the more things I write, the more I write history, the more expectations there are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land I created, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high clay, the buzzing, the buzzing, the buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this buzzing. I love the buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this buzzing?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the totals stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Overhauled, overloaded, overstated, burned out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzzing stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mum is one single work subject.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mum won't be there, but you can write to my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says:" "" "kittens, I want to go to Shonda Land." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1, when the buzzing ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The engine buzzing stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job any more. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The totals did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzzing was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, worked weekends, no remorse, no delegate, a titanium is not asleep, does not give up, with all the heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a flagship Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no more fun.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the totals and the totals I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you do, the work you love, suddenly fades?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think:" "" "loy yourself, stupid author-Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know, you do it, you do, you're working, you love being a teacher, being a bankers, being a mom, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love someone else and that gives to one the buzzing when you know the buzzing when the buzzing stops, who is one then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern waitress" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I'm on the way out, late, and she says," "" "Mom, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I already want to say no when I am aware of two things:</seg>
<seg id="674">"" "first, I must say yes to all and secondly, she didn't call me" "" "kittens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="675">She doesn't call anyone any more "kitten."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I'm Titan and grab my buzz, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mom, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"" "and I say," "" "Yes" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="680">Nothing special about this.</seg>
<seg id="681">"" "we play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" "" "Everybody Poops" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and panic, loneliness and lack of boasting, I can't do anything except to watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land I created, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons, and the song in which it is about letting go, or whatever the girl in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door opens and an energy boost enters.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that doesn't happen immediately, but it happens it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The totals are coming back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, barely there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the buzzing, but a buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no mystery. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">Humming, humming, titanium dioxide, that's just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I describe TV shows and how dysfunctional my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzzing is.</seg>
<seg id="707">Humming is not a force and it is not specific to work.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzzing depends on the love.</seg>
<seg id="710">Humming is the current that comes from the zest of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real buzzing is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real buzzing ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be completed, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real buzzing is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words to me, for which God told me I'm a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I'm doing this as a rule so that I can free myself from all guilt as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no choice. I have no choice unless I want to hear the buzz again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing isn't just the way I work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer working at the workplace than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, because what kind of man is better than being at home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I'm too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We race around in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">At the same time, I feel overwhelmingly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always take my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the totals of the universe fulfilled me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you think me naïve for a daydreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">You're right there, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they're not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">There are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybug or biscuit replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And my teenie-daughter speaks with me for a whole 15 minutes, I am mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, there is no need for more.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can spend 15 minutes on the track, even at a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a day!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are ready to pray.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my oasis of well-being, my world. it is not necessary to be the children. it is important to feel the buzzing, to have a place for peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "to" "" "play" "" "in general." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I'll fail and I'll be victorious. meeting friends, reading books, enjoying the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"" "" "" "do you want to play?" "" "is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in my training, when I wanted to surpass myself more and more." ""</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the track, why not treat yourself for 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong about it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzzing came back in my spare time. the buzzing seems to return when I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself again in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the buzzing, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the buzzing, the buzzing isn't me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="775">The totals of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The totals of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sum of the work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so grateful for that.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is to me that I'm a Titan. I've never seen a Titan, the trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functioning. my campfire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel like a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the clearer my head is.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the buzzing. the land I create, the marathon I run, the troops, the canvases, the high clay, the sums, the sums, the other, the right sums: the buzzing of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this buzzing, the more this unusual, dying, bare and new feeling of life in me becomes wide. less titanium -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel this buzzing, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am a writer. I think of things, I'll awaken you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is part of the job, which means living his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">This is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a bit dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"" "I said" "" "Yes" "" "to less work and more games." ""</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another after a serious stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low self-healing capability.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became a functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nervous functions through various surgical techniques.</seg>
<seg id="804">"" "they certainly have heard of one of the best known, the" "" "depth brain stimulation." "" "one implanted a electrode deep in the brain to influence the neurons' circuits so that the neurological function improved." ""</seg>
<seg id="805">It is really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease, suffering from severe tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story started 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I provided patients with cranial brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that in the case of cranial-brain-traumas, the brain will be swollen and the cranial pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save life, it is necessary to reduce the pressure of the cranium.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a part of a swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, to analyse the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to make cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Allowing cells to grow from a tissue is comparable to very small children that are taken out of their families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and the environment to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François managed to succeed.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw this under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked just like a stem cell culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from the biology lesson that stem cells are unripe cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They were divided slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new strange cell population that looked like stem cells but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They are made up of 4% of our brain-brain cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of the fetus they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they get us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain as we find them at higher concentrations near brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so secure.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear, however -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are in front of a potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non-language area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then select colors to be able to trace them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we re-imported them at the point of departure of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- autograph transplant.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we reimported these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we reimported the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we reimproved the cells in a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed again, they go back home.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we inflicted an injury and reimproved exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we were able to observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been re-imported.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells that we dye in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we couldn't stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable level of dexterity, we injured the motor skills range in the motor Cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">After that the monkeys were paralyzed, they couldn't move their hand any more.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in humans, they spontaneously recovered up to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to some extent, just like the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkey, who recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">See now when we reimported the cells: the same monkey, two months after the implantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that these were very exciting results for us as well.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I will soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>

<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical trials on humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. based on these great results, you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: that's understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First of all, it depends on the clinical study's approval.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patients to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply it to a multicenter study.</seg>
<seg id="897">First you have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>

<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant that it actually is, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them unchangeable.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">Democracy is in fact dwindling with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- it was unmistakably clear to me as the finance minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- will not affect the austerity programs that have been implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment, I thought there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew, or the Communist Party of China, or some of my rebellious friends who told me that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to present you an economic model for true democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, along with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup are mistaken, we could save ourselves the democracy, but that we need a truthful and defensive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy, our societies are darkened, our future gloomy and our great, new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of extravagance I would like to point out to you an interesting contradiction that currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twin-summit paradox" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A peak is known to you. you know and recognize it as the debt mountain which casts its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognise the mountain of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">Yet few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash that belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations, which, however, are too anxious to invest in where it would be productive and income that could produce the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs, for example green energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">In the past three months, 3,4 trillion US dollars have been invested in the USA, in England and in the eurozone, in all the prosperity of producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4trillion US dollar sounds like a lot of money until it compares with the $5.1 trillion US dollar, which at the same time runs in the same countries and our financial institutions, and did nothing to inflate the stock markets and raise real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debt and unproductive capital are the twin peaks, which are not offset by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the USA, Japan and Europe out of work, and consequently a low macroeconomic demand that, as in a continuous loop, advocates the pessimism of investors, in which they do not invest.</seg>
<seg id="925">Involuntarily comes the circumstances that cause the body to kill it.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hatred with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"" "his extremely wasteful art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents and to finance all the technologies," "" "green" "" "technologies which are decisive for the rescue of the earth." ""</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy naturally concluded too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course, slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of athenic democracy on the grounds of these exclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive factor in the Athenian democracy was and is that it embraced the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but is more important and decisive that it gave them the right to political co-determination with equal weight in questions of state interference.</seg>
<seg id="935">Athenian democracy has not lasted long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that glows very brightly, it is also quickly burned out.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, today's liberal democracies have not rooted their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While Athenian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which in the end was a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For liberal democracy only emerged when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- thus the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our democracies, since the time when this separation from politics and economy began, a relentless struggle took place between the two by gradually undermining the economy and extolling it.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why the politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not due to degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because you can be in the government these days, and yet not in power, because the power has moved away from politics into the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my shark with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is about like a herd of carnivores, which so sustainably decimated the animals from which it nourishes, decimated them at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is with the economy that has harmed politics so far that it hurts itself through the self-created economic crisis itself. the power of corporations is growing, political goods are being devalued, the disparity increases, the aggregate demand falls and the directors of the corporations are too anxious to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism drives the "demos" from democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we must reunite the policy and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" maintain control, as in ancient Athens, except for the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Left already had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go very well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new kinds of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation lets the twin peaks become higher, the waste is more sublime, and the social conflicts lower, as it is -- very soon, as I believe -- in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we need to reorganize the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we democratize the re-unified area, otherwise we end up in a pathological monitoring hyperautocracy, which makes the film "matrix" appear like a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is, therefore, not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements which he has produced --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that of "matrix," or something similar to society in "Star Trek," in which machines are used in the research of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "Agora," in long talks to indulge in the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we can be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"" "so what would it be like to have this" "" "Star Trek" "" "-like utopia instead of the" "" "matrix" "" "-like dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples in brief.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of companies: please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which you are currently working -- is the property of those currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all incomes derive from capital and from revenue and the concept of wage labor is completely overtaken.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the company but who do not work in it, and employees who work there, but which the company does not belong to. no more pigeons between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no rising twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please briefly imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Suppose that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the cosmos," in units of "cosmos" -- and every government pays the sum equivalent to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund is investing in green technology, particularly in parts of the world where investment funds are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"" "" "" "today we have it, especially against the background of a reunited politics and economy." ""</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe you is simultaneously liberal, in which they prefer privileged individuals, and Marxian because it will have buried the separation of capital and labor in the dustbin of history, and Keynesian, globally Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or will we sink into a" "" "matrix" "" "- similar dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide politically together.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if anything that I just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economics is... Do we not do this, technological development will create such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which is called Larry Summers as a "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we experience it, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, then Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">As well as Hayek, that's why I'm a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I'm totally confused.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: in fact, and now we are.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you're not confused you don't think about it enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who said that. BG: in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the orators you have clearly said what you think of the West's view of China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies, we have the impression of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it plays out -- the sphere of economy -- is a fully democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a sense, when I can say so provocatively, China is similar to England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">Because -- remember -- we tend to link liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake historically regarded.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What can now be observed in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China is now proposing to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as the Finance Minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>

<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Roy Price has never heard most, although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slim, has a hedgehog and describes himself on Twitter as" "" "Movies, TV, Technique, Tacos" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a highly competitive sector.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy can't choose any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are on the very right of this corner.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the assessment of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addictive to where, after you saw a relay, your brain asks: "where are more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"" "on the left, here at this end, shows like" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "" "-- -- should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve." ""</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to forbid "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the medium size, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't enthuse.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The print is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing such a thing, so Roy Price does not want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses from an evaluation eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online, where everyone can watch them for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon leaves things for nothing, do you attack correctly?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know that they are observed when watching the shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You collect when you start the show, when you pause, which parts you skip or check again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they collect the data, process them and hence the answer, and this is:" "" "Amazon should make a sitcom over four Republican U.S. Senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so slightly above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a bit different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of hosting a competition, he and his team looked at the existing data on the Netflix audience, so the ratings they give the shows, the course of which shows they like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, what producers, what actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together they went in a venture and decided not to make a sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit with it, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"" "" "" "house of Cards" "" "gets a 9.1 comment on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go." ""</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question now is: what has happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitive, data experienced companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this about?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because the logic somehow states that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data for a decision you make, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">One has 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good television, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis doesn't work, then this is a little frightening because we live in a time when we take more and more to statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the company Multi-Health Systems here?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software. come into contact with it, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in prison here in the US and asks for release, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data, is</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. this is not because a company such as multi-health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the most experienced companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that through data analysis, they could predict outbreaks of flu, the awful way -- through data analysis of Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">"" "it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine" "" "Nature" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked flawlessly, year by year, until it suddenly stopped working,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"" "it just didn't work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine" "" "Nature" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the most experienced companies like Amazon and Google misunderstand something sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data increasingly flows into decisions of life -- at work, in the enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics - an area where some very smart people use unimaginably many data to make serious decisions, such as the decision for a cancer therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1109">Over the years, I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, disassemble this problem in its components so that you can analyze the individual parts; as a second, you put the components together again to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: taking apart and putting together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to dismantle a problem and to understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable for putting the parts together again and then coming to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is necessary to compose pieces and pieces again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That's why I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and mind where they belong also in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience what they wouldn't have been able to do. but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like "House of Cards" was not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show, which meant that they took a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first as they competing for TV ideas, then selecting "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "this is what the data tells us." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data is helpful for better decisions, but I think things are going wrong when data start controlling our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just one tool, and in order not to forget this, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it is also called" "" "Magic 8 Ball" "". "it's amazing. for decisions using a hunting or no question, you just have to shake the ball to get an answer." "" "most likely" "" "-- right here at this moment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will get it out later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I have made some decisions in my life, and I should have listened to the ball afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="1133">However, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace it with a little more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball will be smarter and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it's up to us to make decisions when we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right corner.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions, be an expert in what you are doing and taking risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
