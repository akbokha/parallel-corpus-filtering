Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Irish institution , where young people are supposed to meet today .
a mine chapel , where it is now dug for the underground tunnel .
small farmers cultivate the former ground of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich supports exciting stories .
it is annoying when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everyone knows this , because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historic maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the state government , are anything but current - but very informative .
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Mer@@ cury since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a Fli@@ ck@@ ent@@ ep@@ p@@ ich , which one recognizes as such .
more detailed maps , so @-@ called &quot; ur@@ an@@ ges , &quot; were incorporated into the large picture postcard for towns and villages .
these were created according to the data of the Bavarian Measu@@ rement Office between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first measurement of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic capture of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops finally pulled off with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 : it was the present neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bavarian map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographical Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bavarian Measu@@ rement Management . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the original composition paper for Munich dates from the year 18@@ 56 and is to be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison morning / Today is most impressive in the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
Send@@ ling was incorporated 21 years after the map was created , i.e. in 18@@ 77 , as the Munich subur@@ b .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling lies in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , you can see nothing but fields - at first sight : when zo@@ oming in , a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers : hand @-@ written numbered plots from the so @-@ called &quot; urine collection &quot; from which the Property Tax has been derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small plots there are no farmers there today - but small farmers of the plant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in the Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the location of the Oktober@@ fest since 18@@ 10 , was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert .
on the other hand side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the pamp@@ h@@ let , in the area of the present district of Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; at the Gast@@ eig &quot; or from the &quot; Auf der Lü@@ ften &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one once locked up people with del@@ u@@ sions .
the Munich District Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; was created there in 18@@ 58 / 59 .
from 18@@ 72 Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden was head of the institution - a psychiat@@ rist who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the ban@@ quet of so @-@ called Irish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he was forbidden to use force against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who worked for an exhibition with the institution .
in the first place there was room for 280 patients , later it was expanded to 500 places .
at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the county seat in Hair 1905 .
since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um München @-@ Ost is one of the largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts in Germany .
in the area of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt young people meet at the Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um in Munich .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with educational establishments .
to the west lies the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east residential buildings from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was erected - in architectural reference to the original construction of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which was destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed in 18@@ 56 as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Kauf@@ inger@@ straße was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
in December 1944 the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the city center .
a big one remained until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
the English institute , small business houses and a chapel of mine from the Middle Ages were once stood at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where this day the prepar@@ atory work and on 5 April 2017 will be the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn rac@@ et@@ rack .
with the sli@@ der the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
citizen &apos;s right group publishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Promotion of Far@@ mers has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discrimin@@ atory policies and ra@@ cial attacks from the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Group for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is expected to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls on af@@ ro @-@ ameri@@ can travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ ians to pay special attention when travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able ra@@ cial @-@ based incidents occur in recent times throughout the state and be noted here , &quot; says the group .
a recently adopted Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which makes it more difficult for people to win discrimination complaints as well as the state &apos;s law enforcement authorities that dispro@@ portion@@ ately aim for minorities , prompted the group to release the warning message , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints about such a frequency we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist off@@ ences against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ enn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more fuel during his journey through the state and was taken into custody by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points to a recent report from the Mis@@ sour@@ i General Prosecutor &apos;s Office , which shows that black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and associates about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chapel said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to be willing to bring along ch@@ ewing money or let their relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i reported in 2015 100 hate crimes , according to the latest figures from the hate crime report of the FB@@ I , which classi@@ fy the state with respect to the number of such violations at the 16th place of the country .
the travel warning is also a response to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to su@@ e a company for housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the states had adopted immigration laws , obli@@ ging local law enforcement authorities to arrest people due to mig@@ rat@@ ory violations , which will contribute to further rac@@ ism in view of AC@@ L@@ U .
travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but l@@ ately stakeholders have used the measure as response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
the fence project is elementary
the Fisch@@ bacher Wei@@ ff@@ au@@ n project is a successful project and will be continued in the coming year .
the CD@@ U members of Parliament Peter Weiß and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac provided a picture on the spot .
representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U local association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties in the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family court yard .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first granted insight into his farm , in which it farms 55 hectares of law@@ ns and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many juven@@ iles supplied and accommod@@ ated in five apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Forest Mil@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows , such as Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only region@@ ales come to the table of the holiday guests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since he is also chairman of the fisher@@ man , he described the fence project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fundamental importance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t profit on such steep faces .
the green space ensures a lot of work , a lot of things have to be worked on with the brus@@ h@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight with the conditions and the top@@ ography here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental farm and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ ser , even if it does not lead to bio @-@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leader funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers should be supported at the cost of 3,000 to 4000 euros per hectare .
it is hoped that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the areas could be extended for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are thinking about how to continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often critici@@ zed for the promotion
by 2013 , a total of 25 plots were fenced off by eleven participants .
the maintenance area is 40 hectares , which must not be en@@ for@@ ested by at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total costs of 71 500 euros , half was funded by leader , a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fisch@@ bach .
thus the farmers remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of electric fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job without farmers and rural women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Peter Weiß asser@@ ted that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; best food is produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scape Support Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state support of soft f@@ ences .
the aim is to disclose the Black Forest .
the prerequisite is the presence of a conveyor setting marked by the L@@ PR .
in addition , the area to be enclosed must not be tow@@ ing ( slope inclin@@ ation above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by aff@@ or@@ estation .
the decision of eight participants with 24 par@@ c@@ els , which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence , is currently running for the Fisch@@ bacher Wei@@ ff@@ une Project 2018 .
the total cost of disclosure is 35 hectares , and the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing sacred ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump receives the Statue of Liberty
the sur@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans like this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the company &apos;s place in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated quar@@ rel with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N about the President &apos;s proposals for the dr@@ astic reduction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and liberty I@@ mit@@ eers would have liked him if he had done it .
but it took on its importance , and in particular the meaning attributed to it when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
as Miller A@@ co@@ sta compl@@ ained , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world .
the poem you refer to , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is obj@@ ectively correct , but as he himself formulated it , it is not really about history .
it is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ athers , your poor , and your oppressed masses who long to breathe freely , the w@@ ret@@ ched waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mis@@ erable waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better seen on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA are not welcome .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they had accomplished a highly political act .
the sculpture was to show the connections between French and American republi@@ can@@ ism by portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical pic@@ torial representation .
Lazarus had changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the Ex@@ il@@ antes .
the link between the poem and the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus had changed the meaning of the statue , the people from the right wing wanted to conf@@ use it for a long time .
the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone , but rather an early ne@@ o@@ conservative , who brings the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty progres@@ ses .
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch is not supposed to illumin@@ ate the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here .
the significance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , w@@ ret@@ ched , but hop@@ eful people after long and often aw@@ ful journeys on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever appreciate .
their torch is not intended to illumin@@ ate the way , but ign@@ ite the hatred which is their only source of power .
world Cup 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish Members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the UK &apos;s team
the performance director of the United Kingdom Ath@@ le@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship cad@@ res will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which will start on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something special developed in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the UK &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ath@@ le@@ tics &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Scottish athletes think there is something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type at the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several Scottish athletes are med@@ als , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ t , who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team for team captain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of athletes , no matter if they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the genuine feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought in naturally were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete in the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les at her fifth world champi@@ onships , says it &apos;s &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Scot@@ s@@ men are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the mid @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir runs along this path and has set up five British and two European records last year .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ s@@ man to watch after a great season , which included victory for the British Team Tri@@ als and Anni@@ versary games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first World Championships as the only other Scot@@ s@@ man in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Captain &apos;s Captain says it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enormously proud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases they will also be mixed with med@@ als and fin@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what makes team captain so special is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honor anyway , but to know that my team mates tuned for me and chose me makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Scot@@ s@@ men who belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to climb to Po@@ dium .
as for my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from being back in the Olympiastadion again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out and compete there and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
block Cri@@ tics over Facebook : don &apos;t throw yourself around a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he bl@@ us@@ hed at the criticism , sure .
but he has not sil@@ enced his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and dum@@ b , we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans &apos;s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union lod@@ ged it at the beginning of this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a back@@ lash with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Na , and ? &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a Republi@@ can Gover@@ nor in an overwhelming democratic state that is aston@@ ish@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary heat @-@ head .
he has demonstrated a firm hand in guiding his state and adher@@ ing to the principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means of combining with his voters and playing his hair@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore blocking people coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum called official and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is un@@ necessarily and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans &apos;s spokesperson , Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse , defended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that the blocking of comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who wave the whi@@ p online .
the post was talking to some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
and these are only genuine people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , not troll@@ s .
they all said their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not prof@@ ane .
the priest rec@@ ited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans &apos;s Catholic faith .
attorney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I pol@@ itely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary area of the news broadcast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I also do not appreciate this idea if a number of people take a position on the same subject , then they are dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective assignment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff referred to as a &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; would probably be called &quot; inter@@ ro@@ gation . &quot;
the Facebook Er@@ a simply makes it easy to crop a message by simply blocking a critic or del@@ eting a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times when people have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical cor@@ p@@ ses or to arrest or silence prot@@ esters .
but this is exactly what happens digitally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question was in Virginia last week .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County missed the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when they banned a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of the affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters struck him .
and even then , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions , which critici@@ zed his position on the treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping with Britain , prevailed , according to the historical documents collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project .
but he did not silence her .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreements and dis@@ courses are the foundation of our nation .
and true guidance means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an will host the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who took the last year at Arch@@ er@@ field to the final round before losing Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built and we see how he achieved fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he established this place .
he is a ze@@ al@@ ous advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engli@@ sh@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time even though he won his 32 @-@ year career both at the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the home @-@ based player in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open , since it was taken out of the program in the year after I had won them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday this year , returns to the action on his home ground .
this event will be its first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a little more when you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad when it &apos;s gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer through passive smoke
in the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died because of passive smoking of lung cancer .
researchers at the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases are due to passive smoking a year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in comparison , he drew up an own study on this topic from 1994 .
back then there have been 400 lung cancer cases for passive smoking a year in Germany .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; &quot; &quot; the construction works in Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are somewhat in time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the manager of the station Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than assumed , as there is a lot of hiding in the underground , which is not mentioned in the plans .
traffic , which again and again hin@@ ders construction work , is a big problem for the construction pit of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of drivers against red lights and shut @-@ off grids is already enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are allowed to drive through .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z by St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days have been very exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot;

poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove .
it rarely uses a pot .
in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai province in the un@@ settled Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually den@@ otes a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace .
after half an hour , the char@@ coal tu@@ ber is removed and swal@@ lowed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp to wash .
a bucket in a hom@@ eless space serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , her fields were assigned .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , it can be dangerous to work late : most of the vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one dar@@ es to walk around the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony that was accepted in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were voted to vote in front of the occupation forces .
an existing movement , which stir@@ red up the independence of the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the Jak@@ arta government , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal monitors .
in 2003 the province officially was divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea that included the eastern part of the island .
the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with a rental car .
there is no public transportation .
the city of approximately 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo @-@ f@@ ences , and made of corrugated sheets , which were transformed by rust in various yellow @-@ brown tones .
only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their trip here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , pointing to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her light skirt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst children &apos;s mortality rates and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the world &apos;s largest and most profitable gold@@ mine , Gras@@ berg , in the possession of Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 residents .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port was min@@ ed worth $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has wood resources valued at estimated $ 78 billion .
these wealth , however , are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua , which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military keeps a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid local military personnel and units nearly $ 20 million between 1998 and 2004 , including up to $ 15@@ 0,000 to a single officer .
Pap@@ ua &apos;s demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden go@@ ans and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped , tor@@ tured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969 .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal high@@ lands in the 1970 &quot; s became genocide in accordance with the UN Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested over 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; we Wer@@ den Every@@ thing , &quot; stated in a report by the Bris@@ ban@@ e Arch@@ dioc@@ ese in 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electrical sur@@ charges are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since incidents occur every week , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia expl@@ orer for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have increased since Pap@@ ua &apos;s resources produce an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development changes because Muslim economic migrants are coming from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ping cant@@ e@@ ens sell roasted chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served .
local people fight to keep up here .
&quot; migrants started selling chi@@ ckens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai indigenous , who moved to work in the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the local Pap@@ ua - the mo@@ m @-@ mo@@ m &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - cost her market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of Indonesia , J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as Jok@@ dar@@ i , promised during his 2014 election campaign to address ine@@ qualities and violations of the law in Pap@@ ua .
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua including Pan@@ i@@ ai on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but little has changed in Pap@@ ua , and today the locals are feeling che@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ova in 2014 with the expectation that it will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , only two months after the inauguration of Jok@@ ov &apos;s inauguration in October , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a bon@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn their lights on .
one of the soldiers took offen@@ se in their tone and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their ri@@ f@@ le bombs , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
one child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ an Y@@ eim@@ o , was so severely beaten that he fell into a coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice .
they wore cerem@@ onial hunting bows and led the Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance - running in the circle and im@@ i@@ ti@@ zing a bird song - from Pap@@ ua Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some prot@@ esters began to cast stones on police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , a command was sent to the soldiers via an internal radio : &quot; if the masses are resist@@ ing more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ District of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the lo@@ oming threat and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home .
nobody was in the mood to listen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ ame still does not know who has fired , but says that the bul@@ let came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the local man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cous@@ in , the witness of shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ ama , who , like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , only bears a name , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , told repor@@ ters that his officers wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their station because they are being attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves if people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man for the Pap@@ ua Police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more injured .
the messages about the kill@@ ings only came to Jak@@ arta on the following day .
three weeks later , Jok@@ ova held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately , so that it won &apos;t happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security Minister Wi@@ ran@@ to said in October 2016 that he will establish an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historic human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries have occurred a long time ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the early 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we are committed to tackl@@ ing these violations , but there are processes that must be passed through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta , and said he had no plans to set up a complaint in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wi@@ ran@@ to , who charged the UN for crimes against humanity , called for more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence referendum in 1999 , said 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua were already included , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with fierce intoler@@ ance .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ ama .
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , I am afraid of being shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that the people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military looked for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings didn &apos;t stop .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police fired on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a building company who refused to bring a unconscious husband to hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s location .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw rocks on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) started shooting and killing one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said TI@@ ME . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called upon to punish the officers involved and withdraw the police &apos;s mobile bri@@ g@@ ade from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an intoler@@ ance to the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of tribal people Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green High@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many joined the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army claiming to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by provo@@ king spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings by Indonesian soldiers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ da Kog@@ o@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai have been arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing the national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people of Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty boo@@ sts dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
they keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10.000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the indigenous Pap@@ ua and the new migrants , who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the airport of Nab@@ re .
the few jobs there are in the region usually go to the better educated and weal@@ thier migrants .
Pap@@ ua have rarely invested capital or necessary skills in order to make their own companies competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Go@@ bai , the Chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai tribal council .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , restrictions on the coverage of international media are ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported because of a lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission was given to them for filming .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Assistant Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ov &apos;s electoral campaign , the limitations of reporting to promote transparency and development , were not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ peaceful eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa refusal and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ ua . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March , six Pacific states - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; of Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically backed the O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian foreign ministry Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r pointed back the alleg@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , making it difficult to cover the evidence of human rights ab@@ uses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the Human Rights Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , natives broke their silence and urged him to &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous .
in 2019 , Indonesia has another presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua say that they will probably not vote for Jok@@ dar@@ i again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jok@@ dar@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Go@@ bai , Chairman of the Board of Directors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants the people to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is housed in poor educational and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ bai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their vote for Jok@@ ova as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that he has to pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite threats and intim@@ id@@ ations , the families of the victims of the Pan@@ i@@ ai massacre resulted in the last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the victims &quot; cor@@ p@@ se was buried precisely in front of the police and the military station .
they know that perhaps they will never give justice to them , but at least they will not forget their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us , with a lowered head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what else can we do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of Dubai &apos;s highest residential towers in Dubai , forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 @-@ meter @-@ high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which one sometimes calls the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and when people shou@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; said a resident who called his name George An@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Du@@ ba@@ is civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units destroyed the fire at 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) and cooled down the building .
the government said they work on providing accommodation to those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve issues relating to the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of sky@@ scra@@ pers all over the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damages came from the cl@@ adding , the outer covering for decoration or insulation .
in Great Britain , the police said that the system of plates for insulation and disgu@@ ise at the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup Reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) has been with his great Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the General Meeting of Shar@@ eholders .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the revolutionary proposal to play a Davis Cup single for this sport was not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
the five @-@ set classics , which are often very long , but also very much valued , remain the traditional applic@@ ator .
6@@ 3,@@ 54 % of the member states voted for reform , the aim of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only margin@@ alized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change in order to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic cont@@ ests , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hag@@ ger@@ ty said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will continue to work on improving the application .
even before the vote , the proposal had already come before the proposal to finish the finale at a neutral place .
new from 2018 only compar@@ ably smaller details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be the host right in the next round in the subsequent year .
in order to reduce the costs for the Organ@@ izer , the requirements in terms of training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete less official media appointments before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers bringing forbidden objects to a plane , finds a survey
a survey conducted by air passengers showed that more than 20 percent of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration &apos;s control points were s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ed by , including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while accidentally le@@ aking knives or other items with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed that they were late discovered that they had mistakenly traveled with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey carried out at more than 1,000 people - which was conducted by a Jet Charter Service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers would rather dis@@ regard the rules .
of the respon@@ dents who admitted that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something banned by the T@@ SA were 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , the members of Generation X were .
the most common items that were intentionally passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent claimed to have know@@ ingly worn objects with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male respon@@ dents confirmed they had deliberately brought forbidden drugs to the aircraft .
the company said it was asking travelers throughout the country to find out how many accidentally s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling goods had brought about by airport security and how many had done it intentionally .
it is no surprise that the people who wear the best s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ware - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry through the safety , those who fly the most .
the company , however , points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure which liquids they are allowed to take , or how much of them .
it is therefore no surprise that the largest amount of liquids conf@@ is@@ cated by the T@@ SA are prohibited liquids .

El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t care : to cancel tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers
Elec@@ tro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k likes to give up with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
until now , he has under@@ estimated that some of the customers have already re@@ treated their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the ever @-@ trium@@ phant figures for sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k announced another , less da@@ zz@@ ling number for the first time when announc@@ ing the latest quar@@ terly balance : the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k has often adverti@@ sed more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery starts right now .
now Mus@@ k ad@@ mits that 6@@ 3.000 have already been withdrawn from the 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders .
critics have always pointed out that it is only non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( $ 1000 in the US $ 1000 and £ 1000 ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reser@@ vation Pay@@ ments &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present 45@@ ,000 of these non @-@ binding reservations envis@@ age a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to now about twelve percent of all orders could be considered a problem .
his argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la supplied 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2018 , all models will be combined - 500@@ ,000 , 2020 a million . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demand for this is obviously there .
according to Mus@@ k , there are 1800 book@@ marks per day .
anyone who orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; today may expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new production lines already tested in practice without any major interrup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
however , if greater delays occur , then the non @-@ binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from run away in dro@@ ves .
EPA director P@@ ru@@ itt is reti@@ ring due to the reluc@@ tance of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
one day after being su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the environmental protection authority , took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce the emissions of smoke @-@ causing air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change , when his agency turned out to meet the needs of the state environmental authorities more responsi@@ bly than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the law@@ suit which was raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
the deadline is 1 October for States to meet the standards set by O@@ zone in 2015 .
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay compliance with a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; interfer@@ ing in local decisions or ham@@ per@@ ing economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was prosec@@ utor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma before his appointment , was a reliable opponent of harsh environmental regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed to blocking or del@@ aying regulation , which opposed the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back on the P@@ ru@@ graph regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Appe@@ als Court in Washington decided that the EPA administrator passed his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards simply rein@@ forces the willingness of the EP@@ O to co @-@ operate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under earlier administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed to comply with the dead@@ lines for performance and then waited to be accused by activists and others , and in an agreement to set the date for implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who compl@@ ained the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by judicial proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and the authority it gives us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the EP@@ O &apos;s opinion said that at some point , P@@ ru@@ itt will use its &quot; power to delay and all other legally available power @-@ making &quot; to ensure that the regulations &quot; are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Republi@@ cans in Congress are pushing for a broader new version of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month is to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet set up in the Senate .
the New York State At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of states that had accused the EPA this week , said that the group wanted to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; revers@@ al of the EPA - according to our law@@ suits - is an important asset for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g who flows into their communities , &quot; Schnei@@ der@@ man said .
new York joined California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ian , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil O@@ zone is created when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere respond to sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and can contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year .
representatives of public health care and conserv@@ ation@@ ists che@@ ered on P@@ ru@@ graph surprising course changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is trou@@ bling how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step by the responsible for the protection of the air we breathe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i An@@ n Bur@@ d of the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to address environmental pollution and their special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tum@@ bler celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche , a Ser@@ en@@ ade will be invited to the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday 16 July .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gens their concern .
Walter Mart@@ ini points out : &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in documents in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer urn book : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with the parish church to Tum@@ lingen and the Vog@@ tei &quot; to Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the document , on the Mount of Tum@@ our , apart from the former parish church , there was also a beautiful courtyard where the church or the patron saint belonged and not the other way round .
so people also lived there .
as originated from the description of Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the local image of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; Berg &quot; is the third , the community centre of the village .
old maps dating from the period around the year 1600 prevailed these historical facts .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval church law .
a gent@@ leman who built a church and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also bequ@@ e@@ ath the church .
connected with this was the right to use a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop .
there were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the greatest of the two was christ@@ ened at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell sounded the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over later during the Second World War in 1942 .
during the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 @-@ 16@@ 48 ) the window pan@@ es were ham@@ mer@@ ed and the bells were stolen .
the roof was le@@ aking .
in 17@@ 96 French troops camped near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ our Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from hearing @-@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the church of Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demoli@@ shed .
only the bell tower was left .
in the New Year &apos;s Eve in 18@@ 34 a storm split the steep@@ le and half collap@@ sed .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demoli@@ shed .
only the tower still existing today remained a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today Horst K@@ allen@@ bach and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em take care of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sheep reti@@ re@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn the Hil@@ arius plant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as organisers , the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin@@ gens invite on Sunday , July 16th , to the sixth seren@@ ade on the old cemetery of St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
this is designed by the com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vor@@ steh@@ er Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speaks the closing word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 3.@@ 30 pm .
to the end of the Ser@@ en@@ ade , a drink takes place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over pastures to the forest , &quot; the organisers bring out the fantastic views .
the Ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organizers are hoping for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is of importance for tum@@ ors and hearing @-@ schwei@@ ler .
the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gens feel particularly committed to their home care , such as the Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini .
association wants to have permission from wind turbines checked
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim does not defend itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not envis@@ age a legal pre@@ condition for the construction and has therefore turned to the coun@@ s@@ ellor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim is denied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take back his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 , no wind turbines could have been approved at all , since at the time in Vier@@ sen only a wind power concentration zone existed at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are fundamentally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone results in the exclusion of wind energy utilization for the rest of the urban area .
these zones are intended to prevent a &quot; savings &quot; of the landscape .
a few days earlier , the city Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette by a change in the land protection plan - but the district government Düsseldorf had not approved the city of Vier@@ sen due to a formation fault .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning law , the approval of approval granted is un@@ lawful and therefore also rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current state of affairs : before the summer break , the City Council again resolved the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette ; the approval of the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the granting of approval for the construction of wind turbines is excluded from planning law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the invitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letters have been dealt with in the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them to the occasion of re@@ viewing the matter .
however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the argument of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , a new subsidiary of the NEW , is planning to build four 200 @-@ metre @-@ high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
last year , the company , in which the town Vier@@ sen is indirectly involved , had concluded lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectare terrain .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the power requirement of around 11 400 households is to be covered - roughly one @-@ fifth of the current demand for all four @-@ leg@@ ged households .
the NEW Re intends to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , the city council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in Hein@@ sberg district .
car and tractor crashing : woman dies with a terrible accident
a terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was mort@@ ally wounded .
two other persons were injured slightly .
the state road was closed for hours .
according to police data , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with her car accompanied her 53 year @-@ old mother as an es@@ cor@@ t to the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel .
city and Tra@@ ders plan &quot; Hom@@ eland @-@ shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shopping facilities in the city center in September .
the commercial association and the city administration intend to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 in order to l@@ ure the inhabitants to the city centre for shopping .
as the president of the commercial association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend will make the customers more aware of what offers their own city off the usual supermarket product .
therefore , a market with regional providers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , local companies are to present themselves with their apprentices@@ hip places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city center are to invite for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action is aimed not only on residents of the city and the region .
in preparation are commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend , so Christian König .
city administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
this makes the commercial association and the city a further stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive downtown . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes new offerings such as the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Active @-@ Day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the well @-@ established Sunday , talks with all professionals and owners to move them to active participation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also attractive offers on Saturday and the reno@@ unc@@ ement of parking fees this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potentials should be re @-@ opened or re @-@ opened .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals lost sight of the city center while shopping .
in the end , everyone would have to contribute to en@@ li@@ ven the city center - to land@@ lords , businesses of the entire city and associations .
it was necessary to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that had spread to some extent , had said König in the spring .
Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Mühl@@ hausen , announced that Germany &apos;s third &quot; home shopping &quot; day , for the first time , takes part in five Thur@@ in@@ gian cities for the first time .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , these are Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heili@@ gen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advertise for the appreciation of local trade and strengthen its significance for the common good of our cities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action led by the I@@ HK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct surroundings with his purchasing behaviour .
two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
during construction , a gas explosion occurred in the school building .

a first missing was later recovered dead .
the dead were cler@@ ks of the school .
the authorities presum@@ ed to work on a gas pipeline as a cause of accidents .
only a few people stayed at the Min@@ neh@@ aha Academy building during the holiday season .
tr@@ ump subjected to pressur@@ ized tran@@ scripts of telephone calls Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the boundary wall
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tr@@ ump asked the Mexican president En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to to stop publicly announc@@ ing that he would not pay for a planned boundary wall .
the US president poll@@ inated him because he had publicly den@@ ounced the wall . according to him , he said to him : &quot; you cannot tell the press . &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States , and to let Mexico pay for the project .
tran@@ scripts of his first call with Australian prime minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull have also been published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr Turn@@ bull that a trade for the USA was &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was im@@ par@@ ted by the Obama administration would look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he proposed a ban on the transfer of refugees to the United States .
Mr. Tr@@ ump terminated the call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; That &apos;s the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford Mass@@ ac@@ re : activists conduct rac@@ ist ly@@ n@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ he Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in the Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and rum@@ ma@@ ged to the Ford @-@ Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white rider , could reach the bridge , a group of white men stepped out with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a needle stre@@ ak - took a long train on his ci@@ gar and looked through the wind@@ shield .
inside the in@@ mates flo@@ ated in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man bro@@ ods . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
cri@@ es tore the silence when a young black man was drag@@ ged from the co @-@ driver &apos;s seat .
fortunately this horri@@ ble scene , which was played on July 22nd , is just a follow @-@ up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost everyone in the audience ba@@ de very real si@@ ghs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , civil rights activists came back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were ly@@ n@@ ched by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
nobody ever was accused of mur@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really incredible that in all these years no one person was arrested - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps organizing the post @-@ ordination . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is a stain on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man of the State of Georgia and a life @-@ long civil law .
for him , demand serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that an injustice was never corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must receive justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot come to healing and reconciliation , until we receive righteousness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a bai@@ li@@ ff submitted a blanket over the cor@@ p@@ se of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FB@@ I files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but nobody ever was accused .
although susp@@ ects remain on the open for decades , civil rights activists say that double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice enabled the black people of Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer elections .
roughly at the same time as the election , according to the FB@@ I , the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com pl@@ agu@@ ed a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a battle - supposedly due to a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ or in the city was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s &apos;s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore was not from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white country owner , paid $ 600 to free Mal@@ com from prison , according to the FB@@ I .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when they came away from prison and approached Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a mo@@ b mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes an FB@@ I report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removed evidence and kept the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks puts it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an electoral law massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed in order to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , it will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has conducted the annual adjustment of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
her depic@@ tion is clear , po@@ ign@@ ant and gro@@ unded in a kind of deep rac@@ ism that many want to believe that he no longer exists in America .
it is hard to watch , and more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about ly@@ n@@ ching because we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I &apos;ve gone through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest of the Black - crowded into a room and listened when Gre@@ ene began a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene co @-@ director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has played the role of the boss &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boss &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; member for years , but he said the role will never be easier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not like that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room rehear@@ sed the actors Dar@@ by Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , scre@@ aming the ne@@ sts and pushing him , fur@@ i@@ ously , that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , --@@ he , swe@@ ep away from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he reci@@ proc@@ ates the fire .
there is a break .
and then everybody ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what ? ! , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ cona . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ch@@ ick . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think that white people said &apos; n --- he &apos; said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ i@@ onship replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy making this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene begins again .
this time when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharp and with emphasis .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends ab@@ rup@@ tly and quickly .
there are cri@@ es , shots and then silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman suffering from grief is over the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays hoping song &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen people caught sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost uni@@ form@@ ly divided between black and white .
a couple came from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many just come down the street .
they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as oppres@@ sive humidity for nearly eight hours , when Broo@@ ks takes her on a pilgrimage to the graves of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ sey .
up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one stands in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y .
when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the cor@@ p@@ se .
children sit in their heads , register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they &apos;re not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little boy m@@ um@@ bles as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch rope and wipe their tears .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw embra@@ ces Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , who played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ o hu@@ gs two of his te@@ amm@@ ers and then breaks down in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have done this for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience sat down with the actors for dinner .
a white pair from Atlanta uses a table to talk about the offspring with a black pair they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words that made him feel the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like yourself and do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does to me makes me believe that the ly@@ n@@ ching is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today this is called police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks yard is holding on his desk , eating and remember@@ ing citizens &apos; rights .
he said he started to plan the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post @-@ ordination is inspiring , for it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like we don &apos;t learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ an in Bayreuth
also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf set on a colourful fri@@ vol@@ ous st@@ aging in front of a gigantic six @-@ story setting .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by A@@ lek@@ sand@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner together with the wall rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ in and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from East times or the New York Stock Exchange .
in front of it , an open Mercedes classic car park , in which the Rhein@@ au@@ chter pose as a rock @-@ conductor , or alternatively a Is@@ etta .
stack@@ ed oil barrels remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ mo@@ tiv - money , power and gre@@ ed - which goes through his &quot; Ring &quot; production .
the three Rhein@@ au@@ ts - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise wonderfully as in &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot;

Stephen Mill@@ ing sings the wonderful nasty Hagen that surrounds the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ weight box@@ ers .
brut@@ ally the scene , when he was afraid of Siegfried .
later , Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) has to believe in it .
the audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause .
Fo@@ ster , Mill@@ ing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski are celebrated stor@@ my , humble and form@@ id@@ able to the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te duo .
there is great applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in casual leisure wear .
the performance was eag@@ erly awa@@ ited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors .
in 2013 , he had to let go of a g@@ lar@@ ing pipe concert , there were five years later great rejo@@ icing , in which the isolated &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; calls went down .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have enjoyed this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you notice that the audience with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has grown in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it has also grown into an understanding of its viewpoint .
I draw a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
Max Quanti@@ ty works as a volunteer
they work in different places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
quantity : usually in a stone belt at the furniture exchange , once a week I will help here in Gre@@ ven in the Fur@@ niture Bridge .
and I also worked at the school for an open full day .
what is your experience with it ?
quantity : it &apos;s a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to deal with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , thus a late @-@ employed volunteer .
how does that come about ?
lot : I did a high school diploma .
and then a civil engineer , let &apos;s say , abor@@ ted successfully .
I realised for myself that it is the wrong thing for me and that I want to do something else with people .
and then I asked myself what are you doing .
a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on the spot , in the focal point maybe also , really .
and was it like that ?
lot : I have gathered some great impressions .
I will start my studies in the welfare sector in the winter semester .
I will study dual , probably make a social worker training in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
isn &apos;t it unusual to have several different places of work during the Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er Service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends where you make your FS@@ J .
from the retirement home to youth work one can do it - in all possible facets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me , this was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
in other words than in civil engineering ?
a lot : well , here it &apos;s not about calcul@@ ating st@@ atics .
you always have other people up@@ side down , each having a completely different story behind them .
whether a refugee if a teen@@ ager has been brought out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually .
very interesting .
and you didn &apos;t have any reservations ?
amount : I &apos;m not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , great kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is like that .
Pear@@ son cuts further 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that she will reduce some 3,000 jobs and cut her intermediate dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure the company is facing .
the job cuts announced by General Director John Fall@@ on primarily for the end of 2018 and early 2019 are in addition to his previous restructuring , in which 4,000 positions were already lost .
in May , Pear@@ son announced a third cost reduction programme to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in order to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the rapid pace of digital learning .
the company , which last month sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged , after an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kab@@ ul con@@ vo@@ y attack : soldier killed in suicide attack
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ vo@@ y in Kab@@ ul , a military con@@ vo@@ y , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter had been viol@@ ated , divided a statement by NATO .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died during the incident in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h .
the bombing is the last force that Afghanistan has hit this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a Nato statement it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening was happening when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised le@@ pro@@ sy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and are treated at the Bag@@ ram air@@ field in the US military hospital .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Tali@@ ban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian fat@@ alities in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , suicide bom@@ bers killed at least 30 people in a princip@@ ally Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Tali@@ ban said they had done this attack .
on May 31 , an enormous bombar@@ d@@ ment in the city center killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack on the country since the US @-@ led troops forced the Tali@@ ban from power in 2001 .
the violence rein@@ forces the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Tr@@ ump has weigh@@ ed down the number of U.S. troops that support military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that in recent weeks the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policies and , in particular , the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA revers@@ es decision to delay smo@@ g rule according to complaints
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to delay a regulation of the Obama administration , repe@@ ating that the states are obliged to cur@@ b the smoke @-@ causing emissions . this took place one day after 15 states compl@@ ained the agency because of the step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ zone provisions 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said that it shows the agency &apos;s obligation to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and by responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said President Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced in June the intention of EPA to measure the o@@ zone regulations - in which pollut@@ ant emissions must be measured in a part of the country in order to establish where inc@@ isions must be made to delay stric@@ ter air@@ quality standards - to delay one year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 largely democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a broad range of environmental charges imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that , according to Tr@@ ump , should boost economic growth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ back of democr@@ ats and nature protection groups that worry about the effects of greater emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA website says that inhal@@ ing air , o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
community wants common room
in the end , the decision was clear : in two counter@@ parts , the municipal council decided on the establishment of a community space in the future retirement home .
before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing property is signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ ades .
although it will still take a while before the church community has so far belonged to the community , there is no planning obstacle for the project to be st@@ em@@ med by a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common room for this .
one of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - some 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a volume of 70 square meters for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the municipal council prefer not to fores@@ ee such a common space as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ ean living , but open to the church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ cafe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision , which has already been decided in autumn by the provision of funds for the current budget , will be made possible by means of funding .
the building is located in the renovation area .
the establishment of a community space would be , according to T@@ j@@ ades , supported by 60 percent of 30 percent .
the proposed resolution looks to signal the investor to indicate that in this respect it is not intended to throw a bil@@ l@@ board between the legs , the finding that both sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ers - which is based on the surrounding environment - as well as pent roof - would be possible to reduce the height of the seat and make the construction more economical .
need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer says , be this additive .
when it helps : it passes the body unanim@@ ously .
it &apos;s not that easy at the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation points to the many of her own buildings , with which one does not move so well , for that , one lean now in the common room from the window , she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m so hard with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger strongly speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a community participation .
it fores@@ ees a hidden subsi@@ dy to any anyway @-@ wealthy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the purchase of the area there is no subsi@@ dy , but I get a real counter @-@ value , in case of doubt , is the counter @-@ speech .
Sta@@ ge@@ er &apos;s application to apply the resolution correspon@@ dingly is found in three pro@@ pon@@ ents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two counter@@ parts in the original programme that Stefan H@@ aller concludes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we make the decision , we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision with car : cyclists are hur@@ led on the street
when crossing the road a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycli@@ st was hit by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath and severely injured .
as the police announced , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was traveling by 12.@@ 20 o &apos;clock with his bike on the bike path of the Black Forest road from Hil@@ den .
the senior wanted to cross the road in the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver in the same direction granted priority to him .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder traveled to the street , however , he obviously did not pay attention to the counter @-@ traffic .
he met a car with 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was taken to a hospital by a ambul@@ ance .
FC Bayern Munich must ren@@ ounce the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba must let the game take action against Dortmund .
with personnel worries , FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first obligatory match of the new season .
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) the personnel worries of the German football record meister Bavaria Munich become ever larger at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti has to ren@@ ounce to David Al@@ aba in du@@ el with the BV@@ B .
the Italian confirmed this on Friday .
in addition , the Mun@@ ch@@ men Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six test games , An@@ cel@@ otti has bl@@ amed the physical condition and the missing balance in his team &apos;s play .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last but not least , this was not good . &quot;
the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory season of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intelli@@ gently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights fascin@@ ates the fans .
the game is sold with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) shared on Friday .
w@@ ander in the resin from star to star
in the resin , the nationwide first &quot; Star@@ way Path &quot; is to emerge .
this is planned by the association Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet trail in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star@@ way Path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to meet the information needs of many visitors , called it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he brings nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase through 2018 , the association is planning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; easily accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in question : St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the boards should be added to the Internet .
therefore , a good mobile network reception will play a role in the selection of the location .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later the Star@@ way Ticket will be extended by train .
&quot; on the Star@@ way , the viewers experience a lot of worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; the club explained .
in addition , they learned why stars had different colors or why one star more light than another , although it was far more distant .
it also conve@@ ys in which con@@ stellation a selected star is located and when it is best seen .
the association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg since 2014 , the highest situated observ@@ atory in northern Germany .
according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park counts to the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
since 2003 , at the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Göttingen , there is something similar to the planned star@@ light - the planetary path@@ way .
starting from Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ etary Trail leads up to H@@ ain@@ berg and the Observ@@ atory - as well as an extra @-@ terrestrial location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( community of equals ) with the Sed@@ na planet .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to to the d@@ warf Planet , dem@@ oted at the end point - are set exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks so to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the sun measuring exactly 75 metres away measures 70 centimet@@ ers away .
the entire distance of the planet &apos;s path is about four kilometres .
while the light from sun to Plu@@ to takes about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are therefore faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fixed star , however , would take half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ash@@ enko meet for the first time discussing a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ash@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were supposed to stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they stayed in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , to Gar@@ cia , the beaten World Bo@@ xing Council lightweight champion , going down the hall@@ way to greet Lom@@ ash@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organization super @-@ spring weight champion .
after Gar@@ ci@@ as &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia put out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you doing the champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ash@@ enko ur@@ ges his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday night at 7 o &apos;clock on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ax@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mt noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former weight of the spring , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia rec@@ alled . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I asc@@ ended for Bron@@ s &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I would like to come down to light weight .
and he must move to light weight plates &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that demands the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ash@@ enko agreed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
climate asked whether it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ash@@ enko must fight with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year in order to schedule a date with Gar@@ cia during the next summer ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their lightweight title fight in the Forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans asked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia , and later pushed open to fight for the network offering the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said he appreciated Lom@@ ash@@ enko as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he may possibly participate in his Saturday battle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lom@@ ash@@ enko held a generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks the three @-@ fight champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks very slowly , I &apos;m sorry about Mi@@ key ... you wanted the co @-@ out . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show impact , then boxes .
both said they could feel the momentum created for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the fight to be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ash@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been waiting for the top comb@@ at@@ ants , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four wounded after the punc@@ ture of the tire
in the case of an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were seriously injured in the afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control over his vehicle at 4.@@ 30@@ pm shortly before the end of the connection .
the car fell to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ turned and then stayed on the roof in the green stri@@ pe .
the four in@@ mates - two adults and two children - were severely injured during the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service the A@@ 7 was locked in direction north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; the chain works better &quot;
after the 2 : 2 at the start of the season , and@@ re Hoffmann hopes that the optimization of the def@@ ences will score points .
with the first match of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy , with the result too , would not have been the two ad@@ versaries at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two ad@@ versaries too much , and we have to watch out better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the defense player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the supply chain is to be further optimized .
and the For@@ tun@@ ics don &apos;t want to catch a gate after a free kick .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be like no one else besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) puts himself on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team can better cope with the experience in preparation with the three @-@ chain , rather than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t yet know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is confident of his cause , &quot; because we have players in the half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gieß@@ el@@ mann who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequisite is , but that we still better harmon@@ ise and we do not make so many ab@@ norm@@ alities in the construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann will also go to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can talk about a failed start , you don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we are on Sunday with four points and we can focus on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a good season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer didn &apos;t want to know about that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I judge the start of the season only after six to eight days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of Saxony had to be stopped early due to a storm . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season almost with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann that the players from Au@@ e might even be some fres@@ her because they don &apos;t have a heavy and complete deck like Fort@@ una in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know exactly where they are at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the interior def@@ enders of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guests from the Rhin@@ eland receive a light favorite on Sunday into the encounter at the last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we swe@@ ep them away just because we are entitled to come under the first six , is rub@@ b@@ ish , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which you have to beat in advance , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as supreme coach .
&quot; meeting such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el wants to see his players on Sunday in no case .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ old application tests published
the latest results of asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden submitted to a new method for ass@@ essing their age show that more than 80 percent of the people tested are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authorities for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( Rä@@ t@@ ts@@ manship verk@@ et ) started the tests last year .
during the asylum procedure , they should take a closer look at the estim@@ ation of age after the Swedish Migration Agency ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) was critici@@ zed for errors in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees who were minor .
to date , Migration has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 tests and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , whereas in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be under 18 years old &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are carried out only in cases where the person &apos;s age is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are stable over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past few months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases where the person has been judged for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seek@@ ers have lied about his age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the paper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det investig@@ ates the 5@@ 81 published results , she found that in 243 of these cases the person had said openly that she was 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , for X @-@ ray images of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a skep@@ tic is the en@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work involves ass@@ essing the biological maturity of people to see whether they were going through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to evaluate the biological age in this way is very un@@ safe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we can &apos;t say it , we shouldn &apos;t do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the newspaper metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generally , you can say that the risk of judging a child as an adult is low . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is that if the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fully in the Plan
works on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
a seven ton concrete part on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach was installed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , forem@@ an at the Department of Road Engineering and Transport in the Regier@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the works began at the same time on all three rehabilitation @-@ needy bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building end is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule will be kept .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , crosses the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ aul@@ ted bridge made of concrete , which is covered with a red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure the stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabil@@ itated .
the other two bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red coloured sand@@ stone .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called bridge cap .
this is a marginal attachment , which is also used as a mode of operation .
on Friday , a 2,@@ 20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on the southern part of the bridge .
then the pedestrian route is going to run .
the particular aspect of this is that it is finished parts , a patent granted by the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already provided with the patented bridge caps .
special finger tip feeling has required the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable where many companies are connected .
the local residents were informed in advance of the work by hand@@ outs on the project .
fish and cra@@ y@@ fish first had to be f@@ ished .
for the bridges between the building yard and the collector in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is fully closed for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach town entrance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the three bridges amounts to 700 000 euros .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : under protest with German potato salad
it is not so common that parties are pulling together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is difficult to get under a hat is coming together .
the parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Linke ) are part of a broad alliance that displays a peaceful flag this day , as the Af@@ D invites in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle R@@ ond@@ ell to the lou@@ dly poster of the &quot; Great Camp@@ aig@@ n of Elec@@ toral Camp@@ aig@@ n . &quot;
and well @-@ known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ l@@ land make the leading duo for the Par@@ liam@@ entary elections on September 24 , and vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on the spot for hours before the start of the event don &apos;t want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ voters , but to demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colourful . &quot;
originally the city picnic under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; is planned on the fountain square , but now takes place on the parking space below the rear - and thus right in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colourful picture that is offered here .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair of the Forum A world and one of the author@@ itative organizers , is really happy : &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot;
there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; original German potato salad , which the Af@@ D could easily eat , &quot; says the woman who brought him along .
the police has ordered a lot of officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence especially at the railway station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ eis reported by the Af@@ D Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel , he took care of such an event and got the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had asked Dau@@ n first , but there was a refusal because of the Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ ch already constructed there are not enough parking spaces available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so now the R@@ ond@@ elle , Hom@@ eis is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a view to the event at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is also true : at about 8@@ pm there is a band for entertainment at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , in the Stad@@ thalle various speakers , including the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D chairman Uwe boy .
there are about 200 people in the hall waiting for the leading candidate for the Par@@ liam@@ entary elections , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch to talk about their speeches .
the police presence remains unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
the Af@@ D event takes a little more than an hour , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is a short time after 9 o &apos;clock .
the police can press down - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one hits trumpet
there is a re@@ union with the wol@@ f@@ ist tro@@ mb@@ one Freder@@ ic B@@ elli in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ conc@@ erte tomorrow , Sunday , at 20 o &apos;clock in the monastery church .
together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; Balkan folk &quot; meets classical German training with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ aun@@ ist of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both unites the desire not only to transc@@ end boundaries on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .
for example , Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new gu@@ ise , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; world music &quot; combines with Bulgarian folklore , and in the song &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the Jazz@@ ech@@ op@@ rei@@ str@@ ä@@ ger N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classi@@ cism , jazz and free play become a fascinating total artwork .
this piece of the program was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram had written it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with their special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart openly talks about their bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite in grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the argu@@ ably most famous relationship of Hollywood stars was the one of their &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , which eventually dealt bitter@@ ly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the brunette Dar@@ stell@@ er ass@@ ures her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was seriously in love with whom I have had . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I &apos;d have played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after their separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and believed the du@@ alism seriously .
so it never interfer@@ ed or hin@@ dered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I only liked it , not being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially she suffered from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in school time when she pre@@ fers to dress like a bu@@ b : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this really hurt me .
when I was eleven the children told me that I would look like a boy .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , they don &apos;t like to explain their love life : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people expect you to relate to a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me than@@ kl@@ ess , but I don &apos;t like to have to justify myself before the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening a rally with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of re@@ thinking ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally broke out in joy .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republi@@ cans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; as a trainer , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised earlier a big announcement at the West Virginia R@@ ally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s democratic candidate .
justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes finds that he owns coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth about $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
meanwhile , on Thursday evening , the Republi@@ can National Committee made an explanation in which it said : &quot; the change of the party of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party , which would rather hin@@ der us from working to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , in@@ significant message , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said R@@ NC Chairman Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world leader of Ath@@ le@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as evident exc@@ uses from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated it is not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in sports .
Russian Ath@@ le@@ tics leader D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ lac@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF convention on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were taken away from competitions gold and silver med@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF convention voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) found evidence of state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the repor@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole Council and the whole Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has realized that it has experienced some fairly hot times and will do all possible to ensure that the federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think that progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the next few months we have to do everything to norm@@ alize that situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle always was that we wanted to separate clean ath@@ lete from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes are competing at the World Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships starting on Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still active , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in London after a talk at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ceremony for soldiers dis@@ car@@ ded in Mali
during a funeral service in the North @-@ Hes@@ sian F@@ ritz@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two soldiers were thought of a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
defense Minister Ursul@@ a von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing to the un@@ explained cause of a crash .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but she described the two opposite pilots as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pat@@ rons of their subject . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow down to this highest sacrifice provided by the Federal Republic of Germany in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she stated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen met in Mali on Wednesday a week ago .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a total guard of the Bundes@@ wehr into the F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ er Dom Sankt Peter .
at noon , only the relatives in the church took leave .
afterwards , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as the politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the German Army Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
the bun@@ ches laid down ro@@ ses , the relatives were arm in arm on the coff@@ ins .
before the church , F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ s and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Defense of the Le@@ yen called the opposite soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sat@@ ined . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann set up the flight operation of the fighter hu@@ b@@ screw@@ driver tiger in F@@ ritz@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger drivers of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regi@@ ment to which the soldiers belonged , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the crew couldn &apos;t turn the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no doubt about the UN mission in Mali that Prime Minister von der Le@@ yen did not show : the use was dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country , of which we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral , the coff@@ ins were brought from the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr does not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want a grave beside his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife after his death .
this divided the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the Ros@@ kil@@ de cathedral .
the sculp@@ tor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the Queen agreed with the decision of her husband .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , be still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would have liked to become king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he retired in 2016 and also covers the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prinz@@ reg@@ mahl &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik did not get the title and the function he wanted , he could not see himself as equal to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish royal house , declared .
where the last resting place of the 83 year old will ultimately be , be still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he worked for the last 50 years .
born in London in 1965 , Mr. Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristoc@@ ratic family , met Mar@@ gre@@ the in London .
on the Th@@ ames he worked in the French embassy .
during his later wife the sympathy and sympathy of the people always flew , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his 50 @-@ year reign of the Dan@@ es .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik wrote about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was floating , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ l@@ ises , which I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation to be the brand of socially critical intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not to be ashamed .
these were two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants rapid re@@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
Nieder@@ sach@@ sens Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is , after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority , for a rapid re@@ election of the Land@@ tag , but he does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because , on Friday , the resolution of the Parliament was cancelled . &quot; &quot; &quot;
prior to that , the surprising withdrawal of a Green Group from its state parliament in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the Parliament elections , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its short one @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the present Green Euro MP El@@ ke T@@ westen combined her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ üm@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover .
s &amp; D Group leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ul@@ ler wants to recommend his faction to include them .
with this , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats .
up to now , the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
the new Parliament will be elected on January 14 next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ äl@@ ler said that the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Stephan Wei@@ l considers it indispensable that the Land@@ tag decides as soon as possible its self @-@ resolution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U will probably decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the state constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility that the Land@@ tag el@@ ects confidence from the Prime Minister and sel@@ ects a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution offers several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these options have to be checked legally properly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ing@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will discuss in peace all the questions if they are judi@@ ci@@ ally checked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ um@@ ler called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ western &apos;s step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but something strange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ it@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she described herself as a tra@@ der of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the back@@ sliding de@@ pu@@ ties to return their country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we of course assume that she has given immediate effect to her country mandate , which she has received via the green country list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the regional pres@@ idents Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group leader Anja P@@ iel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we deeply regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she consciously decided not to lead pron@@ unciation in the group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot follow this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transgres@@ sion of the Lower Saxony Green Group MEP El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of former Green @-@ Democrats in Lower Saxony is not only treas@@ on to voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the S &amp; D Group on Facebook on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly elect the Land@@ tag .
the leaving of T@@ west@@ ens costs Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her last divor@@ ce and in her fru@@ stration is her personal interests before the good of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty intri@@ gue and attempts to make it political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
s &amp; D leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ul@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to include El@@ ke T@@ westen in CD@@ U .
the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , accused T@@ ests of fal@@ si@@ fying the outcome of the 2013 regional election with a personal career .
the CD@@ U was the strongest force in the SPD at that time , but SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of a vote in parliament .
interview - How do we protect ourselves from gre@@ ed owners , Herr Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses on contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
agricultural Minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) talks to the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) in an interview .
Mr Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from pois@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers to check the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the Länder provide the latest information on the offen@@ ding eggs bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
also , if after all we currently know a health threat is practically ruled out .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible reaction of the crisis - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , my house has been un@@ locked immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since becoming aware of the const@@ ern@@ ation of Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
in the same way , retailers have to ensure that the products sold are market@@ able and harmless to health .
if the residual value of the resi@@ due exceeds 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , these are not market@@ able .
un@@ poll@@ uted eggs can , however , be sold and consumed .
this time , the factories are not to blame .
do manufacturing companies and consumers sit in the same boat ?
according to the state of knowledge , the production facilities do not imp@@ ly any immediate fault .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the contrary , they have to expect economic damage due to alleged illegal practices of service companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as always , there are too few controllers in the case of an emergency .
is it missing only on the staff or even in case of conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
it was just the official controls that have revealed the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , truth is also that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is precisely why a consistent education of such events and the transfer to the public prosec@@ utions in the cases in which criminal off@@ ences can be present are of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made it clear several times that I expect a complete enligh@@ tenment from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular al@@ er@@ mis@@ m really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to exclusively receive safe and market@@ able food . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly reb@@ elled .
the pan@@ de@@ mic means manufacturers , retailers and consumers get into a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
in general , it must be clear that the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ producing animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately .
this must be done consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
I expect from all competent authorities that the facts are quickly and completely clari@@ fied .
how the financial rules of football affect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imped@@ ed expendi@@ tures of European football clubs won &apos;t bo@@ ther N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to prohi@@ bit teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules , launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G has to prove at some point that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar has been funded without major losses .
Barcelona paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to buy Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary which will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can certainly make the money loose for N@@ ey@@ mar to sign and bring him to a gal@@ axy of other stars , given the funding of the team by Qatar &apos;s rich royal family .
clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players , but must be counter@@ ed by means of legitimate income sources that allow them to break even point in their business @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs that had taken huge debts in their quest for success , effectively che@@ at and ris@@ ked to ruin when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration to clubs debt to monitoring their losses .
the change meant that the business model that Roman Abr@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P publishing period running until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the pres@@ idency in 2015 , his successor A@@ lek@@ s@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to sc@@ are off excessive expendi@@ tures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for FF@@ P for UEF@@ A , compared to The Associated Press last week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PS@@ G has paid the Buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for reporting on the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the revenue will be exp@@ elled for the next five years in the amount of 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the tough@@ est sanctions .
PS@@ G received a fine of € 60 million ( back then $ 82 million ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season were limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players .
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to out@@ wi@@ t their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their income from companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a Catal@@ onian company could sponsor PS@@ G if the sponsor@@ ship value was to exceed the standard market rates , UEF@@ A would not be considered a legitimate income .
exactly this happened in 2014 , when UEF@@ A decided that the sponsor@@ ship of the P@@ SA was raised by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come about payments from the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar have argued that N@@ ey@@ mar World Cup will be ambassador and that such maneu@@ vers could be easy for UEF@@ A regul@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to avoid any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , on Thursday the people familiar with the situation .
they discussed the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associated Press , as they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with sales of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last financial year still have to be published .
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and jer@@ sey sales .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent following signature .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s removal by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial Dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the La League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ar@@ senal @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sport @-@ ty@@ co@@ on , divi@@ des the reservations of La League against a state financed by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it becomes very difficult to respect the financial fair@@ play because one can approach different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new Du@@ chess supplier
during the past years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has made board chocolate for Swiss .
now the sweet co @-@ operation is in place before a possible end : the airline reis@@ su@@ es the order .
on request of the news agency s@@ da Swiss @-@ spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed a corresponding report from the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; from Friday .
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 17 million small red @-@ white packed g@@ og@@ g@@ ite charts of 14 grams per year distribute the flight atten@@ d@@ ants before landing to the passengers .
Swiss did not want to give any information about the cost .
industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders according to &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of approximately one billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effect : for a manufacturer of manufacturers , it is a prestigious order .
the Swiss will not want to reveal how many applicants there are in the new tender .
but only Swiss manufacturers come into question .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the contract for spring 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a statement .
chocolate tablets distributed Swiss since 2006 on board of their flights .
before completing a contract with Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry Cal@@ le@@ baut had delivered the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hu@@ g .
Swiss introduced the possibility to place the logo two and a half years ago with the start of collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline co@@ operates with different Swiss chocolate producers .
for long @-@ haul flights , the First Class customers will be spo@@ ilt with treats from Con@@ fis@@ sion Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class passengers shi@@ og@@ gi von Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
on the short course , Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y will be distributing both in Business and Economy Class .

nostal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; in the niche
this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ s , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ Gr@@ unge era ( when the pione@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ holder rot@@ ated the Sk@@ etch com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to bigger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise it feels like time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first Day of Camp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of his absurd hum@@ our ( it contained an original story for a talking lad@@ le of vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by focusing on the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play hor@@ ny children who will grow up - they managed to reg@@ ain the im@@ possibility of reg@@ aining the last part of the wi@@ t .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with its adults who now play adults is less emo@@ tionally rooted and its par@@ o@@ dy goes more according to the watering principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 &apos;s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le . &quot;
at one point , a character rum@@ mage through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gra@@ cious co@@ op ( Mr. Show@@ holder ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( K@@ en Marino ) has still not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy @-@ evil plot , included in the Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ holder ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , ex@@ courses are the best part of fran@@ chise .
it &apos;s a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s lower lip of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; his former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old cra@@ cker .
these are the moments of random del@@ u@@ sions that could heat this fran@@ chise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until it reaches that which I consider as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose final scene will show the band how to visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon meanwhile reminds of another kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War by &quot; The Americans , &quot; the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde , &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its East @-@ against @-@ West Ring @-@ War I@@ con@@ ography .
created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka , the com@@ edy with Rh@@ ys Thomas as director gives to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the road of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Greg@@ or and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alogues are syn@@ ced by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to watch ( the police sp@@ ends the time watching chess on TV as Americans might do it with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &quot; Find out the voice . &quot;
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer who carries a Re@@ ag@@ an mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one .
with six long episodes , the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent .
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; which was re@@ but@@ ted to a lesser extent , could better supply his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p @-@ sati@@ re , as Greg@@ ory and I@@ os@@ ef always visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message for the imag@@ inary communist public is that Western culture can do everything to feed for a ban@@ ish .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
drugs Ma@@ fia in the country
the police succeeded in beating the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Baden @-@ Baden circle , Rot@@ t@@ weil , Con@@ stance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office Con@@ stance announced on Friday .
at the same time , 15 people were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and had already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
in addition , the officials saw major quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros safe .
in the case of the same ra@@ ids in Italy two persons were arrested .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects .
the two are therefore presumably delivered to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators participated in the action .
a total of more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ma@@ fia members are accused of organised drug crime , serious violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating Con@@ stance against organised drug traffi@@ cking in southern Germany .
there was a lively exchange between the public prosec@@ utions in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo and the investig@@ ators of the Cri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore the big insert on Wednesday morning was accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
the investigations were aimed primarily at Italian nation@@ als with close reference to the Italian ma@@ fia .
also a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired up in a restaurant early in the morning , is likely to go to the bank account .
way acc@@ uses big gaps in foreign registry
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreign registry in Germany has significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to partly serious mis@@ concep@@ tions in asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ e Management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has drawn attention to large gaps in the immigration centre register .
in the case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , short@@ com@@ ings in the data recorded there may result in some serious mis@@ concep@@ tions , &quot; warned in an analysis provided by the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
in the register , according to the information , ten million people are registered with foreign citizenship , including some 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data are therefore managed by approximately 600 immigration authorities in Germany .
because the data were not maintained adequately , the quality of the data in parts has not been good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , dates were found in 1921 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by people who are no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not actually show up in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data entries can significantly slow@@ down return processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , there are EU citizens who don &apos;t have to travel at all in the statistics of sufficient people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but such impro@@ per arrangements &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; led to a distorted debate on dealing with ex@@ tri@@ butions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently started sending refugee families back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they came from there .
this proceeds from an internal paper provided by the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück@@ er Zeitung . &quot;
according to the paper , this means that the BA@@ MF re@@ stores such procedures &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and to@@ dd@@ lers - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
this was virtually no longer possible since the end of 2014 , so the newspaper was referring to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement , it is responsible for refugees from the EU state that they reach first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a migrant travels to another EU country , the state can send it back to the country of immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Office now declares : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has increased significantly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy gave guarantees for the reception and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ t@@ HR ) considers these commitments sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement .
the domestic spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing group in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children are threatening due to defici@@ encies in the Italian Asyl@@ um System and a threat to child welfare . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood of people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach provided the blood donation service for other people .
at least from the twelve citizens who received awards on Friday .
in the meantime , Jürgen Gre@@ ys , who , with his 100 donations , now donated 50 litres of blood .
traditionally , at the meeting of the municipal council , the congregation acknowled@@ ges that there is multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is brilliant how our body is designed for it and we pay tribute to the don@@ ors who provide their blood for strangers , not sel@@ fish , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the Director of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Ma@@ isen@@ bacher , because the cann@@ ed are broken into their components . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three persons could already benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , Ma@@ isen@@ bacher reported about the actions carried out in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach in the spring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K Regional Head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the change to the theatre house led to higher number of participants a few years ago .
in front of this Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a were counted among the multiple don@@ ors and received 50 donated blood donations for each of them .
half as many book Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ oth@@ ee Ri@@ jum@@ pers , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter stipul@@ ate ten times per 500 milli@@ liters of their life juice .
Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
Bank of England is expected to later announce that interest rates will remain unchanged since the weak economic growth and weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation over an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it maintained interest rates on family income in the midst of intensified pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s political decision @-@ makers ( M@@ PC ) voted with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates down to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members striving for an increase this month , as weak economic growth has weakened the support of an increase .
in its quar@@ terly inflation forecast , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and in 2018 at 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on budget income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in autumn .
but it sign@@ alled that in the next few years , interest increases would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation raised by the Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that the bor@@ rowing costs might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw part of the mamm@@ oth business package published one year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will take time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks as of the next February , although it has now been said that it is now expected to make 15 billion pounds available within the framework of this system - at 115 billion pounds sterling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the rate of interest it repeated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary to cool inflation and a &quot; slightly larger &quot; scale than the markets expect .
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank stressed that increases were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incre@@ mental &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts revised down@@ wards for this year and next year are compared with the 1.9 % and 1.7 % forecast in May .
it has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the Po@@ und dropped to these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 Euro .
the decision to no change comes after the latest dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations on net interest and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % has risen to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , even though the Bank will recover slightly after the end of the year .
the recent inflation forecast showed little enthusiasm for households , which are affected by rising inflation and marginal rise in sal@@ aries , as the tigh@@ tening starts even worse before it becomes better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that in the next few years , monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clearly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to recover at the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak Po@@ und , which will compensate for a portion of the lower consumption expenditure .
the decision comes a year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the ground .
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will fully achieve the prices and the economy .
prior to the Bank &apos;s last ruling on interest rates , the call was increased after an increase in interest , as inflation increased the pressure to hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers demanding an increase of 0.5 % in July .
inflation decreased from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % last month , although the bank said that this was expected and will attract them again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that the excess in relation to its target of 2 % is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wholly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak Po@@ und . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , director of Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ salary Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent decline of swa@@ p rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again , as the len@@ ders are looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing dealers are running out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) seeks to prescri@@ be 10,000 people controversial HIV drug
&quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment in September following a fight against the High Court against funding the medicine in the N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ menop@@ aus@@ al pre@@ p pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now supplied by the health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial , after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed last year &apos;s ruling by the Supreme Court , according to which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p in spite of the claim that the local authorities should finance it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England boss Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; while the National A@@ ids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to make the registration of people possible , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ p pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infection @-@ prone areas .
pre@@ p prior to sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
to those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and people with HIV @-@ positive partners who have not been treated successfully .
clinics identify appropriate participants in the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy .
people who live in England and are registered with a family doctor may also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program is awarded £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to evaluate the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence on a large scale .
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in more than three decades of ongoing progress in addressing one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive Officer at NA@@ T ( National A@@ ids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , when targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is truly controlled individually and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ian Green , CEO of Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now be that the study will be carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now that the pre@@ p test medicine was procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , shadow health minister , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation by the government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt will give us a step closer to the understanding of the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is conducted as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV infected , and that they will contribute to the completion of the spread of HIV in society one step closer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living the Great Life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , decreased in 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; Jo@@ anne says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was looking for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot flat has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , plenty of light . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she commissioned the architect and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed of Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the issue .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other without having to bend over . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but to put the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height on top of each other - with a lot of additional drama .
a classic copper @-@ light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us over@@ looks the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area for the mezzanine .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illumination set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends a short corridor is mirr@@ ored in order to make it seem longer .
in the kitchen , mirr@@ oring feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance there are mirr@@ ored units for all the cutlery and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
collap@@ sible kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering work went in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is counter@@ matter so that when you push the door , it sli@@ ps very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will be selling the floor - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a real estate agent will enter and make a calculation based on the bottom size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here , they succeeded in enlar@@ ging the floor area while simultaneously using high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not love the electrical sockets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage of some standard into something quite amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate empire &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two Brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a dispute about one of the largest real estate imperialist Europe worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a mansion in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets are to be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have acquired 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , accumulated since the 1973 family purchased a business at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there , the West@@ co je@@ ans family set up je@@ ans and grew up to a chain of 160 retailers .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
this money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Brun@@ swi@@ ck and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centres in the suburbs .
following an agreement with her late father , Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - accounts for about two @-@ thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
a court book states that this means that Col@@ in owns property worth £ 316 million and Paul worth a value of 176 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the distribution of real estate and cash has proven to be a problem for Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .
the brothers now also fight for control over the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul asser@@ ts , have excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul to manage some possessions in@@ compet@@ ently .
in an early affair submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to join the fight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian inheritance stipul@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost increases in the case of hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and both parties held law firms .
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who run dairy bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brun@@ swi@@ ck in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood Property where Col@@ in opened the first je@@ ans of the family .
Col@@ in says he began West@@ co when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis states that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to gra@@ ci@@ ously pass on her property to her sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis corporate group , wher@@ eu@@ pon Col@@ in claims that Mark paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars on leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul says on the terms of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in with@@ drew very much , although he was a former AF@@ L member of the board and after a biography of 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS , to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case was before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul has decided to su@@ e me and pull our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not wish that Paul and I would end up in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , adding that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our business will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s new chief of staff plans to restrict the president &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly could actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the White House &apos;s new Chief of Staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more regular course .
here is a piece by repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the White House &apos;s new chief of staff , met with senior staff on his first day of work , he presented a major problem to President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House that he wanted to repair : poor information that got into the president &apos;s hands .
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by super@@ vis@@ ing his media diet .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s relationship to television dates back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if candidate Tr@@ ump was anno@@ yed due to unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of positions that were to be persu@@ aded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former election campaign manager Sam N@@ un@@ berg opposed to Poli@@ tico in February . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keeping Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter habit under control , according to six former election campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay . OK .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s Twitter habit was ever &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
perhaps these campaign officials know what we do not know - that tr@@ um@@ ps twe@@ ets without their interventions have even more combus@@ ti@@ bles .
we will probably never experience anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
if his employees managed to keep him away from him several times , their efforts paid off .
but no one has consistently been able to prevent Tr@@ ump &apos;s controversy .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , are always trying to advance their own agenda by presenting tr@@ ump material that may promote their views from the world .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO - dealing with this story - reported in May about the fon@@ dness of advis@@ ors to give the president doub@@ t@@ ful information for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ smith :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former tr@@ ump @-@ officials say tr@@ ump as a volcano can react to negative press cli@@ pp@@ ings , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he will find out where they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was exactly what happened at the end of February when somebody had ci@@ ously accused the president of a printed copy of an article by Goth@@ News@@ .com , the website of Internet pro@@ voc@@ ateur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson has been permanently ban@@ ished from Twitter for har@@ ass@@ ment or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has expressed false alleg@@ ations in the past and has rev@@ oked it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; tr@@ ump read the article and started asking people about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gold@@ smith added that the former chief of staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the White House Secretary General Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work , receives the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did this work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove to be more effective than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still strive for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys &apos;s mission very difficult .
most wanted criminals receive mail from Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and hoped for .
the police all over Europe sent post@@ cards to dangerous criminals this summer .
as the addresses of the sought @-@ after heavy criminals are not known naturally , references from the population will be raised and requested .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday about the action that follows the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent calendar from winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences had shown that many fle@@ eting prisoners hide at vacation destinations , said the name of Euro@@ pol .
we have put together 21 post@@ cards for sought @-@ after criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , the website has been viewed at www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ art , more than 2.5 million times this has been viewed .
36 of the online accounts could be fixed so far , at least eleven of them due to clu@@ es after the publication on the website .
travelers will negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aire range &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some determined travellers on the base of the war , who negotiated a dig@@ ging out of the church to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; travellers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans in a field outside a prosper@@ ous road by Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aire series . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of v@@ ans after they were thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a dig@@ ging excav@@ ated by the Council to prevent their invasion .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense posts and pushed its vehicles through a passage that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents have pushed the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous resident said : &quot; they went there on Monday evening after being sent on by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw rocks on the p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must indeed be forced to implement it because it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travelers were there in May , were moved on and are now back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; more came last night , probably even more today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by keeping long instructions to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue paying my common tax if the Council does not even stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a local people who didn &apos;t want to be called said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we &apos;ve just seen the last lap of these travelers just to be lo@@ oted from another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the figures have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to move forward as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to support our collection , it is very important that as many people as possible announce an anti @-@ social or criminal conduct with the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this contributes to creating an image of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Birken@@ hof is called Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the For@@ mer Hotel Birken@@ hof is called Lu@@ ise Forest Hotel .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and is to be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Hotel Birken@@ hof by the then Ambiente operating company l@@ t@@ d. on April 13 , 2014 some 30,000 over@@ nights per year were lost and also income from the tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the district , the hotel building was offered as a collective shelter for controversial discussions .
the city prevented the housing of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a building plan to secure the territory as a hotel location .
at that time , the decision was not un@@ disputed in the Municipal Council .
but above all Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s Mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious prospects in the house at that time .
he was to be right .
the group Lu@@ isen@@ hostel with managing director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof with a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again to a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object has four houses .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you will find Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Birken@@ hof we have been building sh@@ utt@@ lec@@ over@@ s in front of the entrance for a long time , and when one enters the house it becomes clear what extensive renovation work is carried out .
the floors were demoli@@ shed , ceilings partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs were removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it &apos;s actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are built .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later , everything should become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nicely home &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities .
it is not possible to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale city level , Sch@@ erer acc@@ entu@@ ates .
Sch@@ erer explains the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms .
single vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel at ease in the hotel .
he had already held talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and director of tourism Michael Kr@@ ause , so Sch@@ erer .
the no@@ tions of the city were identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are on the same line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
asked for the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to pin@@ point exactly .
he is expecting just under one million euros .
the external installations are also placed on the front @-@ line , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace which will be accessible by the restaurant , which is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : U.S. Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator sets up Grand Jury
in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special investig@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee received the work over the past few weeks , wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; referring to people familiar with the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper took the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller had wi@@ dened and intensified its investigations .
the broad@@ ca@@ ster CN@@ N reported that there are already first charges of the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps of the oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
us intelligence agencies have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time to be targeted at the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller investigated whether there were agreements between Tr@@ um@@ ps election campaign team and Moscow .
the investigations focus on several men who acted as advis@@ ors to the Republi@@ cans in the election campaign .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took a close look at more and more tr@@ um@@ ps of private and business environments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator Tr@@ ump had personally moved into the centre and accused the accus@@ ation of whether the president may have ham@@ pered the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jury is to examine the evidence in possible criminal cases and to decide whether it should be charged .
Grand Jury will therefore also be called ank@@ le chambers .
most of them are switched on when dealing with bigger and controversial cases .
the procedure always takes place behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor to invite individuals to act under oath .
according to CN@@ N , invitations were issued that revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement , called it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r , Tr@@ um@@ ps advis@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ us@@ h@@ ner and his former election campaign manager Paul Man@@ a@@ fort also took part in the discussion .
legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the suspension shows that Mu@@ eller does not want to intim@@ id@@ ate himself in his work and that if necessary , he wants to act fast .
but it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the charge of an indictment .
nevertheless , the implementation of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revelations , on Thursday evening , the president used a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign for his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the subject gives the democr@@ ats a way to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else about which they can talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor , T@@ y Cob@@ b , stated in a statement that he knew nothing about setting up a Grand Jury .
but this also usually work in secret , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House app@@ reh@@ ends any measures which speed@@ ed up the work of the special agent in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former FB@@ I chief James Com@@ ey said three times that I am not being determined by the President .
there is no reason to assume that something has changed from that , it was said in the declaration .
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this R@@ aus@@ age , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump had become loud , he did not want to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
comm@@ enting on a Senate Committee in June , Com@@ ey asked him to set up investigations against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
according to U.S. media , the White House collected material against the Special Agent and its employees .
this triggered spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wanted to release .
unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the late president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired at the insist@@ ence of the President of the Ministry of Justice .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators submitted draft laws on Thursday , after which the Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator could no longer be dismissed as easily .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : giant ic@@ e@@ berg drives Antar@@ c@@ tica
in western Antar@@ c@@ tica , a giant ic@@ e@@ berg of the barely se@@ ven@@ fold size of Berlin has loos@@ ened from the ice shelf .
this shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the col@@ os@@ sus , weighing over a tri@@ l@@ lion metric tons and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is now driving to the north and will probably need two or three years until it is mel@@ ted .
with a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the biggest iron gi@@ ants that researchers have registered in the past three decades .
there is no danger to man from him .
according to research data , the extent to which climate change has played a role in the dis@@ continuation of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear .
however , there have been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s in the region for about 30 years , writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fac@@ tual background .
according to many researchers , this can be related to global warming .
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus has so far been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C ice shelf .
Sch@@ el@@ ice flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
it therefore continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ kal@@ s is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
to the north of this ice shelf , the balance of wa@@ xes and interrup@@ tions was disturbed several years ago .
A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes a complete Sch@@ el@@ fest there .
there is some evidence that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C ice shelf is in danger , as the front edge has never been pulled back as far as it is currently .
in addition , the iron plate stands under tension and can fall apart if a piece breaks down at a key point .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ kal@@ s and ic@@ e@@ berg does not raise the sea level , as they float on the water and ice as much water as it produces after melting .
however , the loss of the ice shelf causes the glaci@@ ers to flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project for the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ eis is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antar@@ c@@ tica with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters .
there it breaks down regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural event and we have no direct link to climate change , the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the record , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C ice shelf will grow back or go back in the long term and possibly collap@@ ses , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said , &quot; Our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even if these researchers do not lead the demoli@@ tion of this giant ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , many ice @-@ pl@@ uses of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen apart over the past few decades .
this long skirt of Antar@@ c@@ tica covers South America .
according to the research program British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Survey has decreased by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the increase in temperature contributed to the decline .
over the past 50 years , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has heated around three degrees and thus counts to the areas in which the temperature is fastest .
CD@@ U wants to bring house tari@@ ff to staff
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant jobs , the CD@@ U demands to step out of the employers &apos; association to become more attractive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only shortly before the summer break , 41 new jobs in the administration took place .
more than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 apprenti@@ ces have their first working day .
the doctr@@ inal points in the circle are obviously highly sought @-@ after .
around 6@@ 20 applications were listed for the places to be awarded this year .
however , there is still a lack of staff to cope with the higher demands and tasks .
at present there are still 50 un@@ occupied places in the district of M@@ ett@@ mann .
among other things , doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration , are sought .
together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG , the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the administration aims to develop a concept for personnel recovery and personnel development according to the wishes of the parties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to meet not only short @-@ term needs for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented evaluation of the applicant &apos;s shor@@ tages .
the overall concept should be oriented both internally and externally , show concrete measures for cross @-@ entran@@ ts and include a training offensive , calling for CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , there is a high number of employees who are leaving the service suffering from illness or age .
so high time to act , so that there are no more jobs left un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , Leader of the CD@@ U , goes out with his party even beyond the joint request .
he already had a bad surprise already in the chal@@ k @-@ day , when he publicly questioned the costs of personnel costs and amazed the other parties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; peoples want all possibilities to be checked which enable a withdrawal from the local employers &apos; association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term , the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - should seek a house tari@@ ff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said peoples . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the CD@@ U tries to pay better the employees and officials when it actually envis@@ ages the tari@@ ff bill for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are exactly prescribed , increases or more money are only available if you switch to a higher level , which is oriented towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Protection Act .
last but not least , by the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , coun@@ s@@ ellor Thomas Hend@@ ele and director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy tigh@@ tens the tone of NGO migrants &apos; lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they should not continue this unless they stick to new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of the Interior , Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis &apos;s warning came a day after the Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a boat of the German relief organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ re@@ at &apos; because their crew had worked effectively with human traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated the illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for one year , refused to comment on the extensive alleg@@ ations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , saving human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organisation in a statement on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge all accus@@ ations that are currently being raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Youth Ret@@ re@@ at &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October .
it is thought that his crew will take rubber din@@ gh@@ y migrants onboard , which will be delivered directly to them by human traffi@@ ckers , and that the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can go off so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the Prosecutor &apos;s Act , whose contents were published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of expos@@ ing itself to the authority of the Italian coast@@ guard , the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the code of conduct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta must above all have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue missions have agreed to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable , as they would not bring any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential amendments or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign up , the Nobel Prize Win@@ ner Organization is Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
in the meantime , Minn@@ iti said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the b@@ ail@@ out measures has declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guard and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives , and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who are leaving these countries hoping to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; &quot; &quot; nine female bi@@ kers , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the northern Pal@@ at@@ inate to enjoy tri@@ als and si@@ ght@@ se@@ ein@@ gs for four days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three friendly guides were available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and wine festival from Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour conducted at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle at Dei@@ des@@ heim .
there were view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could see far above the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald and the up@@ stream plains .
in between there were always longer asc@@ ents for the long tri@@ als .
on the second day , it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and to the folk festival Wur@@ st@@ markt .
once again , a look@@ out spot on the look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; flo@@ un@@ ge &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
on the last two days , many al@@ timet@@ ers were announced again .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refu@@ ges brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , the bi@@ kers breath@@ ed healing activity in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium .

after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga gear up for e @-@ sport
do the sports stars in future sit in front of computer consoles instead of swe@@ ating through sta@@ di@@ on@@ rush instead of swe@@ ating through wind and weather ?
fact : e @-@ sport has long become a serious industry , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans , and huge tournaments with high gar@@ ages included .
the first federal li@@ ga@@ das , which are increasingly involved in this area , have also recognised this .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire entirely new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is sure that many clubs are still climbing on this train . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; next weekend , the FIFA World Association organizes the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in London , where gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven have qualified for example .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advis@@ es an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds in particular , that young people are going to go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially Asian .
with prominent E @-@ athletes under contract , one could be more often present on these markets online than once a year sending the Bundes@@ liga sponsor@@ ship to Asia .
what is it all about ?
during the E @-@ sport , computer games such as &quot; League of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the FIFA World Cup are challenged at competitive levels .
as in normal sports , Li@@ gen has long established itself , in which professionals compete against each other .
and in Asia , e @-@ sport is already part of the official programme .
but is it a kind of sport ?
for many , the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ bing has also dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the German Sport University in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions , which can also be found in classical sports - for example increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
it also requires cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast reaction capacity .
professional gam@@ ers should train not only on the console , but also their body and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ rob@@ bing also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing becomes more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls were difficult to carry out on online games , and the classical sport structures were missing in the scene .
the scientists emphas@@ ise the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport .
the players are internationally on the go , that &apos;s like a big global family , there are no intercultural obstacles .
a study by Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in e @-@ sport .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly about advertising , sponsor@@ ing and major tournaments .
in three years , sales are expected to reach 130 million .
this is little at about 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ sport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Del@@ o@@ itte advis@@ ors write . &quot; &quot; &quot;
internationally , many countries are already moving forward .
big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez take part in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport bet@@ ting supplier uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is also a lot happening in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a Norwegian school , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ sport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was introduced as a lesson , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says F@@ rob@@ bing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to D@@ utt , the soccer league associations in the Netherlands and France are now obliged to set up an E @-@ Sport department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison , Germany lag@@ ged behind , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B CEO R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only to fall into nostal@@ gia and to clear the old times is not enough today .
the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company with the modern market at the same time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ zed world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t stick to it that everything remains as it was always with football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Car@@ ter : sentenced to suicide by Con@@ rad Roy
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend through texts and calls to suicide .
Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been exposed to par@@ ole .
Car@@ ter was sentenced in June for negli@@ gent murder of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is not comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until his vocation .
she had been faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a psychological illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood there with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and facing eyes when she was convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your actions killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she took no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has shown no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that they are absolutely depl@@ orable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , Ju@@ dge La@@ wrence Mon@@ iz said he did not find that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a public prosec@@ utor was reading a statement by Roy &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is no day at which I do not feel the loss of my beloved son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try to be there for his sisters , in spite of all my pain that we will bear for eternity for his sisters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; followed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the recognition that she would never participate in her brother &apos;s wedding or would be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not having this single person with whom I was together every day since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to commit another to commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle .
the case drew national attention after Car@@ ters disclosed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang up , hop from a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family .
in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you need to do is switch on the generator and you &apos;ll be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Car@@ ter &apos;s attention was sought by the death of Roy and ordered them to benefit from the fall by any press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .

Joshua Kim@@ i : learning from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ i was allowed to run as captain at the Audi Cup is no coinci@@ dence .
the Bayern Munich tr@@ um@@ bles a big season to the Con@@ fed Cup winner - Extra motivation does not hurt .
something else was different on his place in the cabin , that saw Joshua Kim@@ i right away , even if the additional piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , no Philipp L@@ ah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er were to be seen , he simply put the split lock on his arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach did not announce it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner commented , after his first use as a Bavaria @-@ captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good , the obj@@ ection could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but Kim@@ i was able to interpret the character from the coach .
not the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal had been chosen as a guide in the C @-@ El@@ f , who had just come from the holiday , de@@ but@@ ant and just from holiday .
sugar is best distributed to those to whom you have a lot of herbs that you want to keep in your mood .
those who were chosen to take possession of the heritage of L@@ ah@@ m can only use a little extra motivation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kim@@ i confirmed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what you want as a player : taking responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old thri@@ ved on the field as a mini @-@ paraly@@ sis .
to the right at the back , that is now its position , the white band@@ age at the arm did its rest .
and Kim@@ i was working at all in this initial formation like the one who can take the helm in his hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ rehear@@ sed tro@@ upe .
he had a view of the whole while many others were busy himself .
vi@@ dal to re@@ play his lack of fitness ; Ren@@ ato sand@@ ches with it , on de@@ vil@@ s come out to start the achievements of the Asia @-@ journey ( also only condi@@ tionally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le do not fall neg@@ atively in their first appearance in the Bayern @-@ Tri@@ k@@ ot .
after all , that worked out very well .
Sü@@ le was running alongside Kim@@ i , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both acted confi@@ dently .
the well @-@ occupied Nap@@ oli storm proved to be difficult , and Sü@@ ach also tried a few times in the build @-@ up .
his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result was &quot; not the way we hoped for . &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance in the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rel@@ ocation , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also picked up for this style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as unusual this Bavaria @-@ world is still for the new additions , one saw in connection to the game .
for example , Ru@@ dy did not give one or two interviews in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but determined six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ i said good@@ bye to some cris@@ p statements in the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard an interesting sentence from Sü@@ le : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s going on here , I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria you just have to win each game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he no longer has to teach the new .

company pleased with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : business pra@@ ises Wis@@ sing Tempo
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able that the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is reflected in more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy , Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) , is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V request of a change in economic policy - and simultaneously blame the old ministers .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Trier Organ@@ iz@@ ations ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing takes on the desires of the economy that has blocked Lem@@ ke all . &quot;
the main turn of the turn sees Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the gap between the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
this year , the Ministry is hoping for a planning procedure , until 2021 the building law is supposed to stand .
a role in the plans of the country also plays the western part of Trier , which stands in the urgent need of the Federal Marketing Plan .
the goal is to take the track into operation in December 2020 , says Ministry spokes@@ woman Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees this as a guide for supporting regional but internationally competitive companies .
like Wis@@ sing , the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) tries to produce a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label in wine to boost sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German exports that has declined for ten years .
furthermore , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , the Chamber of Commerce praise .
the Chamber of Crafts in Trier adds an additional incentive for young tra@@ inees in the new Master Bonus , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euro is provided for the passed master examination and 2500 euros if graduates become independent within ten years of the master &apos;s training .
however , the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
with the planned road construction , facts are to be created quickly , at the same time the country lacks the necessary staff , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , head of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier .
up to now , only 29 positions have been occupied by 56 new engineers who want to hire Wis@@ sing in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art business .
the Chamber of Commerce requests to award more orders to external offices .
CD@@ U Group vice @-@ president Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf therefore points to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country has invested more than 20 million euros less in the maintenance of country roads in 2017 and 2018 .
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country is also so@@ ber@@ ing .
in 2016 regional companies rated the network supply in an I@@ HK @-@ survey only with the grade 3,@@ 4 .
they compl@@ ained about stock@@ pil@@ ing Internet connections and out@@ breaks .
former Minister of Economy E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and still sits on the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become President of a private college in Karlsruhe , where she had already cleared the field after four months because of dis@@ agreements .
Audi aims to change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter @-@ reaction
one day prior to Audi &apos;s announcement , BMW told that it would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
the BMW Chairman said the company believes that &quot; there are smar@@ ter options as driving constraints , &quot; and thus referred to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - diesel vehicles to ban or restrict diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as a recall .
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are considered carcin@@ ogen@@ ic and can cause asthma .
the cost of car manufacturers to install systems for the neutr@@ alization of exhaust gases released by diesel vehicles is also increasing , making it difficult to maintain the price of the cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of viol@@ ating the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen &apos;s faults that could regulate the use of so @-@ called off @-@ off devices that regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but to drive back under normal driving conditions .
several Volkswagen employees were charged in the United States , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from ex@@ tradition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to b@@ ypass the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States has been expanded .
the inclusion of Audi into the study could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to Volkswagen &apos;s win .
this message has the raft on Saturday at Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
so that the Is@@ ar @-@ visitors also participate , a raft through Munich , which has a special message , continues tomorrow on Saturday .
if you pass the Is@@ ar again on Saturday , there will be a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .

on the raft you can see a big information material .
it shows a garbage dump .
the pr@@ el@@ ude to a public awareness campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love is ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar should shar@@ pen as a protective wild river . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll @-@ n@@ oses and the laughter against the suffering
at times Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ on carto@@ on@@ ists , the no@@ bles of his characters are his trademark .
also with 85 the Argent@@ ine@@ an is still drawing and working on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish Im@@ migrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist he suggested , among other things , as a dra@@ fts@@ man for greeting cards - what frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he once said .
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , he made his breakthrough at the end of the six@@ ties : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then also in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines all around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artist let himself be inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own specifications , he still sits still at the drawing table , works almost ten hours a day .
on cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ us@@ hes and clo@@ cks , his dro@@ l@@ ly figures continue to be widely distributed worldwide .
for six years he has also been working on a carto@@ on and a TV series with his figures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the main character in the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand @-@ foot@@ er as counter@@ part . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , which will come to the cinema screen 2019 .
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo .
the script is not written by him .
that is why he tends to rely on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced without any word .
climate change threat@@ ens la@@ ven@@ der from Provence
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened with climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is dec@@ lining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of d@@ rought and on account of the diseases transmitted to scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions , causing great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institute C@@ RI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change over the last few years , which has caused much less rainf@@ all in spring and much more in the fall .
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is also a small zi@@ k@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its di@@ aphrag@@ ms , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there &apos;s a lot at stake .
la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have under@@ developed smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened .
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered are better water distribution and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to d@@ rought .

the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the Week@@ ly Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce weekly conven@@ es in Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a through organised crime , corrupt officials and ce@@ as@@ eless drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children to the office , who were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room : opponent , Neut@@ ral , Al@@ lies .
they ask the repor@@ ters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed , sens@@ ations and abdominal pain .
there are drug s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists suspected of being on the government &apos;s salary list or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no rest from violence , and while the cor@@ p@@ ses are pil@@ ing up throughout the country , more and more journalists are involved : at least 25 since President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to has taken office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are under federal protection after attacks and threats and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven states this year .
among the latter is her editor and her inspir@@ er of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deep , although his presence is everywhere - a great photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the facade of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building . two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panam@@ er@@ ie .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their night@@ mar@@ es , in@@ som@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a special public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , it has only launched two criminal proceedings , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders involved in drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime every year , the kill@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to trial .
at Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , they are still insist@@ ing on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ con@@ sol@@ ent and although the terrain is now even more tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous .
without information about mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for discussion of security has little use , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why , we &apos;re suspi@@ cious of everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the office of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce newspaper in the capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
he managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which was translated with the &quot; twel@@ fth river . &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around freely in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the past year and the ex@@ tradition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the country &apos;s bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields since rival fac@@ tions are fighting to fill the vacuum .
it does not matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of orn@@ ate , two @-@ storey m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings who are larger than many houses for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; rest &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States .
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , was broken by guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
first of all , in February , the publication of an interview with Damas@@ co Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el frac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , assumed gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez to leave the country for his own safety after conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues ass@@ aul@@ ted that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to set up Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drugs problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the newspaper has earned a reputation for the cour@@ a@@ geous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising took place .
repor@@ ters loved to publish sho@@ cking investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to treat .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot @-@ Prize &quot; for her reporting in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in the pursuit of Mexican drug history , wherever she led .
he volunte@@ ered to be afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to keep on living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must take over the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead men ... why didn &apos;t you say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce Team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the fun bird who could cur@@ l like a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and sit there always at the same table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was his love for routine his cal@@ am@@ ity ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced them to question their own ass@@ ump@@ tions about how to do their work best and remain alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like to deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret starting and landing lines , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; anger is said by the editor of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing has happened to J@@ avier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other States where a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape is changing constantly .
in the room in which the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce met for safety training , no cell phones suddenly were allowed . days earlier , it was known that sp@@ y@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ size district of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some repor@@ ters asked themselves whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen called the governor himself as un@@ trust@@ worthy .
it has been months since the repor@@ ters have gone into the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are de facto under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce looked at three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former known boxing champion Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an Ex@@ pos@@ é to the state expendi@@ tures focused on the home town of the Gover@@ nor .
and there was a group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local by drug dealers and authorities .
a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , who belonged to the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which ruled almost the whole century all political levels .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of corruption in high @-@ profile cases .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack .
just a few months earlier , readers would have viewed Val@@ dez &apos;s column as the best informed source of kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had known what has happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez became a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers that prot@@ ested against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because the employees have become something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press .
repor@@ ter Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez took a few notes and went to a demonstration in the morning for another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its .
journalists have become lou@@ der all over the country by writing down on foot@@ paths and constructions in organised protests &quot; S@@ OS Press . &quot;
on that day , director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez leaves Washington and tries to gather international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the Val@@ dez case .
in a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities of sp@@ ying on journalists and killing them because they told the truth .
she has asked since then that she is re@@ group@@ ed by the government , because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her objec@@ tivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surrounded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by organised crime , government officials and in@@ different society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also on orders from politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the media group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and civil servants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her body was found together with a note supposedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as cart@@ el : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it &apos;s hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben E@@ spin@@ osa , who was killed in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .

at midnight on the last Friday , when the last edition was finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and d@@ rank beer when all their phones began to h@@ um .
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with riv@@ alling ri@@ vals and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan resort had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war escal@@ ated further , as promised by a number of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from the edge of the board they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce via mobile phone .
the cover page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens are nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen who kept guard to see if they were ready .
if they were sc@@ ared at all , they did not show it .
under the tremendous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible to all of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the collabor@@ ators of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce followed his tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you just think about closing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the same day J@@ avier was murdered , the intern asked me to send them to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to avoid enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , al@@ beit a frigh@@ tening one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now researchers have found out that the first findings of the incredible r@@ hin@@ or@@ age of a Canadian min@@ er were so well preserved that experts described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was so well received that they could even realize that its sc@@ aly skin was red@@ dish brown - and they said it would have had something of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; troubled past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r specimens in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his unbeliev@@ ably well preserved condition amaz@@ es researchers who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot;
according to National Ge@@ ographic reports , the p@@ anz@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es are the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he was on 21 March 2011 at the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
he met something that seemed to be out of place from the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years covering the wild animal within the 2500 pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy crude oil .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you blin@@ d@@ fold only a little , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature is to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found that this her@@ bi@@ e@@ ater , although covered with an arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , was probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as counter @-@ sh@@ ading , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed a better mix of its surroundings and ev@@ ade its enemies , experts say , suggest@@ ing it was threatened by major din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million @-@ year @-@ old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta Mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours with it carefully .
the astonishing maintenance of the specimen enabled Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the shape of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
they discovered the sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was dark@@ er than its under@@ side .
although the sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising since the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds that of today living animals .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by din@@ osau@@ rs with sufficient pressure that evolution fav@@ ored the conce@@ al@@ ment of the confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals , who use the sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or sh@@ ing@@ les - are much smaller and vulnerable than prey , which signals that this No@@ dos@@ cope was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ ory behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es must have been the chal@@ k age , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to examine the animal for information about his life , including his con@@ served intestinal content to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r when he died was caught in a river and driven out into the sea , where he sank on his back to the bottom of the sea .
at this time Alber@@ ta was as warm as South @-@ Fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably much far@@ ther inland than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with con@@ served sc@@ aly skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same today as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you only squ@@ int a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that it is on sleep . &quot;
the chal@@ k season was a time when huge ther@@ op@@ ods , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , standing on two legs , went through the earth .
although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived million years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 @-@ foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six @-@ tonne monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ mi@@ fied in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he was on 21 March 2011 at the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
according to the museum , it is the edi@@ ble d@@ anced din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from mu@@ zzle to hip .
the creatures on average were about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long peaks that were resting from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were swe@@ pt through the western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the underwater equipment of the din@@ osau@@ r preserved its arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains cover still b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as rare as a winning lot@@ tery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the more I look at it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
c@@ logged remains of the skin cover still the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that carry the skull of the animal .
his right foref@@ oot is on his side , his five fingers are spread upwards .
I can count the scales at its sole . &quot;
in the thunder@@ storm : mass @-@ car@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A8 : many injured
a violent accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : nearly 30 vehicles are wrapped in a mass @-@ car@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous injured , kilomet@@ re @-@ long St@@ aus and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) around 20 people were injured in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on Thursday afternoon .
according to the police , around 5 p.m. between the adjoining locations Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ kreis A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) were close to 30 vehicles , among them lor@@ ries .
at first there are no indications of the exact number of injured persons .
a police spokes@@ man said it was light to moderate serious injury .
a large range of emergency vehicles was at the scene of the accident .
the A8 was completely closed towards Munich .
in the direction of travel in Munich a ten kilometer long way back was formed .
as reported by an A@@ Z repor@@ ter , it also came on the opposite track to massive obstruc@@ tions - by numerous G@@ aff@@ s .
the fire department noted the license plates of the vehicle bay , which now have to be reck@@ oned with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the road to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : you don &apos;t have to sit in the train and sleep .
or one is deeply involved in his work and has just an ingeni@@ ous thought .
and then : buffer .
comes the conductor and ki@@ cks an uncomfortable or ri@@ ps the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the smooth ticket control .
it is easy to confirm by mobile phone that you have taken your seat and thus vali@@ date the ticket .
currently , a test operation is running on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the offer comes , we extend it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be available at many other long distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a train spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the train the ticket de@@ valuation without Schaff@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be able to use it , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to have booked an online ticket - what already most passengers do anyway .
it is also necessary to buy the DB navig@@ ator &apos;s app , which is the most convenient way of booking tickets anyway .
and la@@ stly , you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works : one gets into the train , calls his ticket to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the test customers then have a button for the electronic de@@ valuation .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
if the train atten@@ dant at the ticket inspec@@ tor at PLA@@ Y he knows there is a passenger sitting with already de@@ valu@@ ated online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , work on , keep silent .
check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn is intended to make use of the passengers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train atten@@ dant , check out the DB Navigator yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this allows passengers to person@@ alize their travel time in the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB Internet Marketing Director . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket inspections are among the biggest off@@ ences .
because often you have , in any case , one of your fellow travelers not all the documents you need for the de@@ valuation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you have to demonstrate .
the result is endless discussions between the train atten@@ dant and passenger , leading to bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling your own ticket and by the end takes the time to take care of other matters .
only a small number of test customers can still use the new service .
and this is only possible at the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen connections .
other train numbers on the same route are not un@@ locked yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Britt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was shaken to her core .
just one day after she arrived in New York City , the woman in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled upon a post by someone from high school .
&quot; the police have just killed an eigh@@ teen @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the street , &quot; he said .
confused , since nobody else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly ret@@ ar@@ ded on their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , to tweet live .
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns empty body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l thought . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she put her cell phone off to return to twe@@ ets about people on the Can@@ field Drive later in the evening .
there were photos of police band and people shou@@ ting , and of a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father , who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s Police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed in which a police officer stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video she said , another polic@@ eman said his ri@@ f@@ le and scre@@ amed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am going to kill you ... animals all killing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not usual , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l remembered her testimony . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we got used to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt sh@@ akes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and wept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 11@@ pm , she picked up her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cin@@ emas from the 11th .
it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resili@@ ence that is made up of people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rel came to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on with her daughter , who carried a flower dress and a suitable crown , the two spoke a conversation that they had many times before this morning &quot; on the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people need to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;re going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on now because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I could not take it with me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know and see it and be educated in it .
it must be well developed , not only with activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black Constitution and what we need to do in order to liber@@ ate ourselves .
even if I &apos;m lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience any bl@@ at@@ ant rac@@ ism , she is no different from the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would be doing a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police station , which became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non @-@ prosecution of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new type of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 9 August , my activ@@ ism totally changed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , president of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it all came . &quot;
weeks later , during an evening demonstration , Fer@@ rel met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came from Fer@@ rel@@ l : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently said in an interview , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We have heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on did not have their voices centered and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt passengers .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other locals followed by the team of Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years following Brow@@ ns shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us . we talk , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Davis said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main point for me , as these people are portra@@ yed , for so I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ is &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a Messiah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it turned out to be the most open participant in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ is &apos;s life as she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; Fer@@ rel said and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ ization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ferr@@ is &apos;s story also repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the broader Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who , after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ de Martin , marked the film &quot; Black@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media in 2012 , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions took the whole movement , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said , &quot; and so we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really held upright by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the heart of the film because of its identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook up this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no coinci@@ dence , although it was at the forefront because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black gay woman is so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
in the meantime , the message body in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on has disappeared long ago , but the ra@@ cial connections between the church and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a motorway during a demonstration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chaos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless she cl@@ ings to a voice and she feels committed to this memory since she went on the streets three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we have to love each other and support each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have nothing to lose - except for our chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : readers of TV talk about bit gallery
the bit gallery moves people , even though it has not been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has split the population in pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since its first presentation in 2009 .
cold leaves the issue hardly any .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while some say to the bit gallery : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That &apos;s really great &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Rund@@ ghs ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no man &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the pro@@ pon@@ ents build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city , including the remaining businesses , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the plot where the farmers market hall stands , where 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products .
with the commen@@ cement of construction work , it will end .
the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to be a Bed@@ a seat with possibility to sit outside .
Sim@@ one Room : &quot; for many years we have been shopping in the farmers market hall almost a week .
chi@@ ef@@ ly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the rural women always very gladly .
we also discovered the but@@ cher shop for us .
we would desire that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the small market hall in Frankfurt is especially interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether direct market@@ ers settle in a market hall in the gallery , the amount of rent depends on the amount of rent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the new project will probably not be very low . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why shopping bust in Bit@@ burg ?
be it clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets ? I think this is superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is already enough of this in our city .
you can see how many shops here are empty - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market here , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains .
after all , the goods offered there are offered fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive .
as you can see , shops in a shopping centre are only rented by major companies , because the rent there is often not sustainable for retailers .
it &apos;s a pity , there are almost no special business deals , and that which remains of it will probably also disappear . &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ es : &quot; a shopping m@@ all with a market hall does not fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where should the farmers market hall be located during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long run when the bit gallery is actually coming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or does the gh@@ ost bit Galerie ever manage to distribute all business from Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it just won &apos;t work .
and there &apos;s no need for a shopping center that stands empty .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real peasant market , rather than this gallery .
but there is no place for a farmer &apos;s market hall thanks to the ins@@ an@@ ely many - as I think - no more point@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg anymore .
when the farmers market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a fitting simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York many faces are visible - white , black and brown , which resem@@ ble almost im@@ percep@@ ti@@ bly - that hang on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and Haar@@ passages , sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the sections out of the Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former intelligence analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after publicly classified diplomatic reports on Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , which was opened on 2 August , is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( A suitable simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline combined her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a Trans@@ lator and a ground@@ breaking dissi@@ dent , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg created a sharp , al@@ beit somewhat intellectual comment , by algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA extracted by man@@ ing , a sharp , al@@ beit somewhat intellectual comment , not only to the formation of DNA data - the many ways it can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also to identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward but openly spoke about identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was convic@@ ted in 2013 for 20 charges including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison her picture was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ and @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing clearly sits on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with whom she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg met just about the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
in that , the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette but@@ ts and ch@@ ewing gum , extrac@@ ting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people could look .
that was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while being in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she could not be photograph@@ ed at that time and she could not be photograph@@ ed , so you got in contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her imprisoned mice became un@@ equal bridges , which in the course of two years exchanged several letters .
they even created a com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images , &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o , which fores@@ aw a future in which the President of Chelsea would transform judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama would actually demand only a few days after the book was released , to demand Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome kind of happy meeting .
there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government and against Trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to further infl@@ ame the rigid spl@@ its that it should actually fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery Mann@@ ing called for an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , &quot; the basis of gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ th of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of 200 letters ( or nucle@@ o@@ tide according to the highly developed scientific en@@ cyclo@@ pedia of the artist ) , how amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in a biological sense , we are all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what people will hopefully take away is that our gen@@ ome does not care who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is one of the above com@@ ic nov@@ els mentioned above .
it shows Mann@@ ing , how she emerges from the disciplinary bar@@ racks of the United States like King Kong with a hands @-@ free tel@@ eph@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they strike your speech , they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop your mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - just as it was fores@@ een in the com@@ ic book - but if it should do it , it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ res , which rally like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also target @-@ oriented , like everything in the exhibition , right up to size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing &apos;s stat@@ ure ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with a pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University for murder
a country @-@ wide hunt for human beings is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who are looked for as susp@@ ects after a man was stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .
on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) were issued arrest warran@@ ts for murder on account of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , such as the acts of the District Court of Cook County .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several years .
a public warning system published by the police authority of Chicago states that the body was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead on the scene , and det@@ ec@@ tives investigate the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively searching for the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
La@@ them has been an associate professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cu@@ b@@ unker , Vice President of University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them had now been app@@ alled and excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal case investigated by the competent authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University co @-@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cu@@ b@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker of the University and Somer@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in Britain and are ready to help U.S. investig@@ ative authorities in every possible way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said that he strongly urge the susp@@ ects to submit to the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have a vision of their where@@ ab@@ outs and our efforts to locate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a pu@@ zz@@ ling tip who said something had happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as being very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Grand Plaza management team published an explanation of the inhabitants : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the victim &apos;s background and expl@@ ores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Russian Vice @-@ President Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian Deputy Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in co @-@ operation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented the WA@@ DA &apos;s second part in compliance with the code that describes the criteria for re @-@ initi@@ ating R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , one of the criteria listed in the list states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities will have to publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the WA@@ DA by Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren on publicly funded dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in reference to the matter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no government programs and we won &apos;t admit anything that doesn &apos;t exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ kos &apos;s words coinci@@ ded with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , head of the independent Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Commission .
in conversation with the Russian selling point r@@ sport at the start of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v gave problems to the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condi@@ tionally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 in the course of the dop@@ ing sc@@ andal by the WA@@ DA by the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
however , you have been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA General Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was &quot; moving in the right direction &quot; to be used again .
Al@@ di does not sell eggs for now anymore
these were divided by the company groups .
it was a mere precau@@ tion that it could not be assumed by any health impair@@ ment , it was said in the announcement .
from now on , only eggs should be supplied to Al@@ di , which have been demonstr@@ ably tested negative on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ containing anti @-@ lice .
in this way , Al@@ di wants to produce clarity and transparency for his customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ently .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has never been consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Society Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it called people from outside for help .
a new race of Human Resources start @-@ ups is on the look@@ out to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , offer special groups and demographic groups , to provide employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases , whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow management to circum@@ vent the C @-@ Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee commitment .
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t won .
in addition to the snap @-@ in surveys and surveys from certain teams , it provides a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low approval results - so that you can drill down why .
companies are coming to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken are punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
the global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the finance @-@ technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , who helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year amid the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ all in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
u@@ ber recently registered as a client .
like G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent enables companies to send tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; poll@@ s , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat @-@ maps of your problem areas .
it also provides an anonymous SMS hot@@ line with which employees can report bad behavior .
and when the main business leader is involved , complaints directly go to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the public opinion condem@@ ns the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and CEO of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company is found that treats its employees badly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has appointed Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
in the past , when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the corporate headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a intim@@ id@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees .
now that the company uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that were previously hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states have been identified and addressed more quickly as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can draw closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the risk management Group by Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ es commitment in 2002 , after Arthur Ander@@ sen &apos;s accounting firm collap@@ sed due to ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to their right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies recognized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of venture capital investors that have supported both start @-@ ups .
S@@ apphire received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the total capital was raised to $ 47 million .
gli@@ st@@ ening secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and secured its total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising considering the networked nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only bet@@ s .
the employees want you to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company , feel their voices heard and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t .
investors can reach yields if their portfolio companies run well . businesses run well when employees are committed and committed .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and the commitment of the employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement according to experts in the workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ akers of a company do not take action .
in fact , when a company asks employees for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if change is not fast enough , or not at all , dis@@ appointments can grow and demo@@ tiv@@ ate employees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you have to be prepared to have 4.000 talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management firm Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have reli@@ ed too much on gathering data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow workers ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and wh@@ om@@ ever you don &apos;t care about , why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate actions on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ ret@@ t .
and after gathering feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
in the case of Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always receives new insights into the employees and hopes that in the long run this leads to a better bond of employees in a sector that is known for high sales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not committed to creating a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you lose customers too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , then you will lose company .
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it starts at 11@@ pm when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA football players enter@@ tained on one side of the new training areas of the team on campus .
some have moved out their tri@@ cot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team these in@@ active minutes are a lunch break .
players who are registered at the Summer Courses will return to their final ex@@ ams after the three hour exercise before returning to the Water Sports Football Center the next morning at 6 : 30 am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the guys for the next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before Monday to Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore the first three sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already packed schedule of the players .
the compromise gone from the two days is more than a day at which the Brotherhood moved almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as carried out practical exercises in West@@ wood for the first time .
20 before the start of the formal preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said he supports N@@ CA@@ A &apos;s change of rules even if they add a further point to the players &apos; busy routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it through , they plac@@ ged on , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think that as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices once the camp ends , which in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the upper class , which has already been ki@@ cked off with foot@@ balls , will be no easy task .
Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room there and then hire them to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video tape from an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
that &apos;s why I don &apos;t worry too much about it .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts @-@ check in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false news to third parties and then show their results under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network announced on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated mechanical learning methods to identify possible false noti@@ fications and to send them to fac@@ tual audi@@ tors who may show results of the fact test from the original article .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook was critici@@ zed as one of the main points of distribution for so @-@ called fake news , many believe that they have also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters being floo@@ ded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan that social media networks should be punished if they fail to quickly eliminate hat@@ eful post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of the new facts test will be launched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the knowledge which stories of fac@@ tional audi@@ tors are challenged by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product manager for Facebook news in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
create a com@@ ic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 @-@ s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy seat in the Ir@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ dil@@ ection for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says melanch@@ olic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship , keeping this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story has been illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wi@@ cz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des that is based on an archive : in 2014 he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional .
&quot; I only responded to the thumb print on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb print ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell like smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself was there .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome message &quot; ) this all seems too nice to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena pots on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ch .
he wander@@ ed through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape gardening , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he d@@ rank whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust was only granted full access in 2006 , when the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just began to look after the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristoc@@ rats &quot; said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Empire , cards that portra@@ y who owned what : &quot; one could think that country conflicts would be boring , &quot; Rho@@ des says , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch fighting for the two families .
guys , let everything go their way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se yourself in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farm rebellion of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a record of a rebellion that appeared in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &quot; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Rho@@ des says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising started in this area and I thought that an insurrection was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ter who hid the Dar@@ rel@@ l family for seven years during the English re@@ formation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l is portra@@ yed from the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was dug ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ als are Rho@@ des &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gent@@ lemen seemed to be quite a cro@@ ok , always pay debts and spend money on things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l &apos;s men solved their debt crises by mar@@ rying wealthy old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent for advertising revenue . &quot;
after the end of his use in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique scre@@ aming experiences
he has taken a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about E@@ lä@@ mä@@ ki , the site of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ah , now I have to get back with the dam@@ ned life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle clo@@ aked in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the envel@@ op@@ ing of the 301 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honne@@ f started its campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep Nelson Ar@@ tz &apos;s logo and the slogan secret .
at the end of August there will be a highlight of the campaign on Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th Island .
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the makers of the action have been asking for the plac@@ ards at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote on her website yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically we are convinced that we as Bad Honne@@ f citizens are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it goes on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate a single promise , one that gives the city a unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , she stands in competition with other commun@@ es .
the city of Bad Honne@@ f will cost an average five @-@ figure sum of its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
Turkey &apos;s military reforms - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advis@@ es on retirement and carriage in the officer cor@@ ps .
this week as well .
at first glance a normal process .
but nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting no longer took place in the headquarters of the General Staff , as was before , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
the five Vice @-@ Pres@@ idents and the Minister of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs also participated in the meetings under the chair@@ manship of the He@@ ads of State .
this meant that civilians in the Y@@ AS were in excess .
the government tigh@@ tens the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the air forces and the nav@@ y have been dismissed .
since the failed coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army , mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the exile @-@ pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which Erdo@@ gan sees as a clin@@ ker of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 people , who were allegedly involved in the coup attempt , will be negotiated in Ankara on this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had referred to the coup attempt as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gift of God &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clean@@ se the armed forces &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have the army under control ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published an article entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ ease in military headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the aboli@@ tion of the prohibition of head tu@@ bing for soldiers , the newspaper wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the em@@ power@@ ment of the army and the security forces continues at any rate .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan was firing further 7@@ 3@@ 95 state servants , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed up the military .
the gener@@ als were formerly considered the actual masters of the country .
three times they called upon their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
following his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least under his appeal to the reform requirements of the European Union .
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is target@@ ing an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an un@@ named officer warned against asylum from persecution abroad after the coup attempt , the Turkish army will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts in a few years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this is true , such a development could not leave Nato cold .
anyway , in the Alliance after the pur@@ ges there are doubts about the readiness to use the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational skills are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; NATO diplom@@ ats say . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media .
it intends to reduce legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permits and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ cans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do so by changing the way citizens are spent in other countries Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidate who speaks English , who have the financial means to support himself and show knowledge that our economy will benefit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , cited by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate circuit for the shuttle
over and over again over the past few months there has been a dispute about the future of the race platform - now it &apos;s time to go quickly .
even before the end of the year it is supposed to be built on the road on which the tourist railway goes .
according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work will start on the route this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to continue and renov@@ ate the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is committed to this especially for tourism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Secretary Klaus Stap@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he reduced the costs for the repair of the route to about 2.5 million euros .
this sum represents 75 percent of the country .
the contract , on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered by the country also in the future , is currently defini@@ tively agreed , declared atonement .
the Ministry and the South Thur@@ in@@ gia railway as operators are already in agreement with the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; expi@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the Railway Society will be closed for a period of eleven years .
the racing stei@@ g shuttle will be ordered in a regular order on December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a popular rail link between the Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g railway stations .
over the past few months , a pilot company has been testing whether the route is being used by a large number of people in order to re @-@ order them again in the future .
the track is also heavily b@@ ump@@ y in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry about
just as you thought it could not become even more crazy in 2017 , a new report comes about the technological developments in the field of sex robots .
yes indeed .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robo@@ tics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Emer@@ itus Professor of Robo@@ tics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must start taking her ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people make fun of it , but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them even more frequently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey at the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sex d@@ olls have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adjust &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his robot according to his beliefs , selecting everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it gets more disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ ford woman progres@@ sively look progressive .
modern sex d@@ olls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ Bo@@ ti@@ x robot , for example , enables users to customize their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed person@@ ages such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; adv@@ entu@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that suits your personality as well as possible , &quot; enth@@ uses True Compan@@ ion &apos;s website .
so she likes what you like and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day it also has its mo@@ ods - quite like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired of being fixed to conversation or she can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be in the mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female characteristics , the all@@ u@@ sions to rape , when one approaches a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( meaning here : reluc@@ tant ) far@@ rah , trouble one the most .
on his site was True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it says on the website .
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or simply just another sex toy .
their emergence and increasing sophistic@@ ation point to something dark and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional en@@ core .
most men will of course not keep sex robots , and while the FR@@ R points out their growing popularity , they remain tent@@ atively on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture .
but what se@@ eps out of the boundary zones can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots are popping up at a time when women &apos;s rights are threatened all over the world in which there is a president in the White House who bo@@ asted to have attacked women sexually .
the most horri@@ fic aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphical images , the dev@@ oured body and the st@@ amped eyes , but how real@@ istically this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a big leap .
the aim behind these sex robots is to make a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as real@@ istically as technically possible ( al@@ beit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , when it comes to their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they have no interc@@ ession or background story , nothing that hin@@ ders independence or anything that could distur@@ b the fanta@@ sies of total submission .
in other words , they are counter@@ f@@ eit slaves .
or to say it in the message of 2017 : ma@@ ids
Tr@@ um@@ ps high performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of common sense of man
it has become a link @-@ wisdom of the tr@@ ump era that the political divisions that pol@@ arized the US elec@@ torate have also split families in small format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving , there were newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ voting relatives in the USA .
we all say it &apos;s supposed to burst our filter bubbles .
less was noticed the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps to bring families together .
I mention this because my cous@@ in , a left @-@ le@@ aning poet who lives in Chicago and has worked with the Republi@@ cans in our family for a long time , visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , anyone who knows them , including the republi@@ can relationship with which they fought for decades on account of politics , is suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side .
this is certainly a good thing about the dining table , but it is important to me that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the left was fortified by Tr@@ ump , but the figur@@ ing effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to post@@ p@@ one us all to the right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the sp@@ ook@@ y possibility that his bi@@ bs will not exp@@ el us one day .
however , there is an even more complicated long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump Republi@@ cans are &quot; norm@@ alized &quot; in the right wing , which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards .
today , I find myself falling apart from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ancest@@ ral version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump are indeed a very mild off@@ ence .
when tr@@ ump is concerned , the next candidate of the Republi@@ cans must be only mentally healthy in order to qualify themselves as im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my cous@@ in was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the biggest of the car@@ ou@@ sels in the New York car department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are enormously large , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are kn@@ ur@@ led and the animals twi@@ sting to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ per@@ ishing music conve@@ ys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the Them@@ e@@ Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not one of the major round@@ about in the north of London .
the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magical experience , as here two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could have evaluated the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but luckily no one asked for it .
on the other hand , this week I was forced into a department store to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required .
the poor woman in the department store was exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ ously gr@@ ating while I was tired of experiencing her credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year , he was taken to hospital because of the treatment of cuts on his w@@ ri@@ sts , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to the first death sentence for murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 by firing them several times through a door of the toilet in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a ni@@ gh@@ tly intru@@ der that hid in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year custo@@ dial sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say that she is too transparent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National prosecution authority said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal can be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us runs the risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when Martin Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ thous@@ anders from F@@ oter and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into the holidays and in the secondary schools .
three of the in@@ let students will go to secondary school in the future , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening , school director An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
the 29 students of the four classes under the direction of Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der chose a young eagle growing up in the chicken farm but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , the m@@ lower band performed a musical titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the Chi@@ cken Cour@@ tyard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and caused it to hat@@ ch from his chi@@ ckens .
instead of a chicken , a small eagle came out .
but the hope to make of him a chicken sh@@ attered , the eagle spread out his wings on a high mountain and s@@ wore .
then the classes showed three and four in the rehear@@ sal of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken tan@@ z .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young Go@@ ck@@ eln , who bore the cylinders to the bet .
the eagle stands for integration , said School Director An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te .
the young animal was different from the other young ( chi@@ cks ) , but belonged to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
she wished every quar@@ rel that he felt accepted in his new school .
this was followed by thank@@ sgiving to the colleagues , former school manager Michael Müller , who again and again jumps into instruc@@ tional pas@@ sports , and the parents &apos; representatives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the time of the visit is over now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared school teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she only dis@@ courage her students after two years of teaching , because it had been a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the four @-@ thous@@ anders .
at the end , all students recorded a song of summer time and holiday season .
there was great joy with the children .
eight first @-@ hand äs@@ sler have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were arrested for illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs quoted , cited by television .
on the morning of 1 August , a group of illeg@@ ally moving people was arrested by the police in Si@@ th@@ onia , among them the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day , they were released while an investigation is currently underway .
the State Department reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control over the free camp and lay down anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not meant for this purpose . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inspections are continued throughout the season .
the Ministry said that the Court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what people have to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the action ?
an overview of the most important questions and answers .
at the diesel peak , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should improve the emissions behaviour of cars of emissions classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin of the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new action compulsory ?
no , the software updates are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates will only apply to vehicles that have che@@ que software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the retro@@ fitting has been ordered by the German Federal Office of Transport ( Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced swift implementation in the coming months , but not yet called an exact date .
Daimler AG announced to write to every person concerned .
if an inspection is due anyway , it will be carried out in its framework .
how long should the retro@@ fit be carried out altogether ?
&quot; hard to tell , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
this depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen that the autom@@ akers are not acting voluntarily on the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long will the update last ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
it could be time consuming to get an appointment .
what do drivers do who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE advis@@ es you to wait .
presumably foreign manufacturers would reti@@ re , such as S@@ met@@ anin .
does a massive price decline of Euro 4 cars now thre@@ aten ?

ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving under President Tr@@ ump promises to become political .
one of the lau@@ re@@ ates does not want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to get one of the cov@@ eted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center .
as the cultural institutions announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the scholars .
the awards will be presented at the beginning of December .
traditionally US President Donald Tr@@ ump will hold a reception and join the award together with his wife Mel@@ ania .
the award winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive tv series therefore already announced that he had to refra@@ in from participating in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to negl@@ ect the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ving them of the means - and that bur@@ ies me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she would use the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interview to make clear her view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kennedy Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .
the earlier prize winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ ank and St@@ ing .
we make the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will reti@@ re next year .
the place has already been adverti@@ sed - however , suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been a City Engineer for 31 years .
and the work still makes him great fun as he medi@@ ates in the press conference .
he reports on varied but challenging tasks waiting for his success@@ ors .
at the same time , it is surprising that no application has so far fulfilled the requirements profile .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
thus - considering the regular periods of notice - should still be enough time for a revision .
since Has@@ lach acts as a Lower Building Law Office for the Administr@@ ative Community , the applicant must instruc@@ t appropriate degrees .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if they could not fill them out more , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice .
but clos@@ eness to the citizens is important to the city and to itself , says W@@ acker , who talks about a good working climate and good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some significant projects have accumulated that W@@ acker looks back with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the Bau@@ amt and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future there are varied projects on the agenda : the refur@@ bish@@ ment of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen park has come to an end .
the Kin@@ zig@@ brücke bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed and the stadium refur@@ bish@@ ment is still subject to a theme .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter alone will be able to book about 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my success@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
designed for a city builder , there is a lot of room for manoeu@@ vre .
with Has@@ la@@ chs &apos;s own building yard and gardening we can react very flexibly to much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the old town as an ensemble is listed as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye for what fits in , &quot; when new buildings are approved , the reti@@ ring city architect emphas@@ ises .
anyway , the city builder is responsible for a high degree of responsibility .
he is a client , &quot; in the end , everything is going through my table . &quot;
with care and coordination he can count on many years of co @-@ operation : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been there for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker doesn &apos;t want his successor , too : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city .
who would like to be able to bury Roland W@@ acker , should have a completed academic studies in the town of Has@@ lach as a graduate engineer or bach@@ elor with the subject of architecture and have good expertise in the fields of construction planning and construction planning law .
the municipal building department is subject to high and civil engineering , building control planning , basic building facilities , administration of urban properties , urban de@@ pot with building yard and urban gardening as well as sub@@ urban building law authority including monument protection .
bike on lines thrown : southern track closed
according to the police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bike from the rail@@ road track to the lines in the area of the Le@@ oben Road ( B@@ 116 ) .
these were damaged so strongly that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and have been searching for them since the night hours .
a pink sco@@ oter and a bike rider were observed near the scene of the scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a kingdom of Lausanne , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch on AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ators , or the perpetr@@ ators , would have put themselves in danger and end@@ anger the railway .
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant , as well as the delay minutes and the costs for rail transport , pat@@ rons of the railway customers could also come to the perpetr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum was to be expected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the south railway line could be led without hin@@ dran@@ ce .
just under ten passenger trains were held on Friday morning , two of them concerned the long @-@ distance transport .
freight trains did not fall out , but they were late .
according to Ö@@ BB speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch around 200 metres of overhead cables had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate may sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study maintains exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the incur@@ able condition affecting about 1.3 million in the US and 300@@ ,000 in the UK causes stomach cr@@ amps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diarr@@ hea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while the victim is usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant gut .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells pat@@ rol in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in food do not penetrate the body .
cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging delicate tissues .
if the equilibrium is too far in the direction of inflammation , an inflammatory bow@@ el disease can result from it .
in experiments it was found that a type of tolerance promoting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a specific bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome and the development of a population of cells promoting tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han will promote more toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ lie@@ us if the same system also affects humans .
the post@@ doctoral researcher , Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan , investigated a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , but which was accommod@@ ated separately , did not have this .
it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bes of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced and there were found six species of bacteria that were present in mice with the immune cells but were lacking in mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment , so that they lack@@ ed intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria affected the immune system , the researchers let L. reu@@ ter@@ i grow in a liquid and then carried small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on im@@ mature immune cells isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant cells .
when the active ingredient was cleaned out of the liquid , it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism known as i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ als were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same toler@@ ant cells as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i , high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ als can potentially lead to an expansion of this population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United has committed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; genius &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic &quot; &quot; &quot;
at Manchester United , N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; genius &quot; , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria .
the 40 million pound of signature of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday , and impressed people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira .
but matic was excluded from the pre @-@ pro@@ visi@@ oning Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ and and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va Stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start XI for the start of the season .
the Independent revealed that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still had three new commitments , but he insist@@ ed that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four primary commitments .
&quot; to get three out of four , I thank the association for that , &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have given great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in heaven .
the pilots flew from Seattle to Washington State of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state Mich@@ igan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which is several thousand kilometres .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
the form of a Dream@@ liner was on the radar screens .
the whole was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new draft for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind is turning : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the head of the SPD , Social @-@ Democratic prime ministers always looked after Berlin with a certain concern .
the most important wish of the electoral warri@@ ors was not just a fire from the central party , but not a head@@ wind from the Con@@ federation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , the members of the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus watch the events in the SPD @-@ governed regional capitals with increasing des@@ ol@@ ation .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not have been described in the approach with head@@ winds .
there were failures .
and one by one .
according to the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the CD@@ U sees a general signal against the coalition of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this once again shows more : red @-@ green can simply not be ruled reliable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber to the German editorial office ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the surprising fac@@ tions exit of a Green Group de@@ posed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the Parliament elections , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Green Federal Manager Michael Kell@@ ner called upon the back@@ sliding low @-@ Sax@@ on Green Euro MP El@@ ke T@@ westen to return her mandate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the will .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen must immediately return her mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal Chief and Elec@@ toral Camp@@ aig@@ n for the Green Party of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shouldn &apos;t be true at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD election campaig@@ ner si@@ ghs when the new job message reaches the party centre on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , the SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the CD@@ U without his own government majority following the over@@ stepping of the green de@@ pu@@ ties of El@@ ke T@@ westen .
it is the preliminary climax of a whole series of big and small crises in SPD state associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the misery started with un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saarland region in March .
a blue eye , more not , appe@@ aled to the comrades at that time .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
that became the case - and it got much worse .
the defeat in Kiel caused the SPD to w@@ ander , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te ble@@ w the party smoothly .
the comrades lab@@ ori@@ ously drag@@ ged up again in the weeks after that .
then , when they had just plu@@ cked up new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him came the next draft .
mayor O@@ la@@ f Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD chief of the SPD , lost his Nim@@ bus that weekend , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burned .
and because in crisis communication he made quite everything wrong afterwards , what you can do wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz is fighting for its political survival .
so now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
for the VW @-@ Ex@@ hau@@ st and its role on the Supervisory Board , the prime minister of Lower Saxony has already been in criticism for some time now .
a result of the survey was added .
nevertheless , or maybe because of that , Wei@@ l always tried to set accents in the federal government over the past few weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin did not remain hidden in Martin Schulz &apos;s surroundings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they let him go , because they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party from Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could occur .
at the same time , Wei@@ l is not guilty of the party @-@ internal compul@@ sion of the non @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens .
and Schulz does not already know .
at times the comrades try to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here above all on the apost@@ ate parliam@@ ent@@ arian T@@ westen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , as Mr@@ s T@@ westen combined their own career opportunities with the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. T@@ westen has not been elected as a direct candidate , but has been elected to parliament via the country list of the Lower Saxony Green Party , according to the de@@ pu@@ ties of Lower Saxony .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary faction , compl@@ ains an &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters &apos; willingness four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan Wei@@ l the Prime Minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a leading candidate in the election of the Bundestag , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of future CD@@ U members is fal@@ si@@ fying the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he asked to clarify the background .
I want to know if there has been more or has given further commitments to the CD@@ U of Lower Saxony .
funding for center core III
anyone who wants to renov@@ ate his house in the years can soon get support from the country .
in addition , mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of St@@ eg city development informed Sen@@ gen on Wednesday .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler once again gave a review of what happened so far .
since 1991 , there have been in sens@@ ations san@@ itation areas .
back then , in the san@@ itation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land Baden @-@ Wu@@ ert@@ tem@@ berg took over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous refur@@ bish@@ ments are a &quot; successful project &quot; - it is ultimately important to also promote interior development , and not only to open up new building areas .
on April 4 , I received the information from the Regier@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Karlsruhe that there will be a rehabilitation area III .
the total funding amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which 500 000 Euros are from the country , the rest of the community &apos;s sens@@ ations .
how does a san@@ itation area develop ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; you will continue to explore , so Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it also plays a role in whether there is any interest in the planned area in general .
if necessary , the regional boundaries could then shift again .
on Wednesday evening , the bridge represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal state programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in whose framework the restructuring would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the programme is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and developing the infrastructure .
the measures would be carried out object @-@ related , i.e. per property .
the san@@ itation area would then finally be defined as a statute .
the licensing period for the funding is running since 1 January 2017 until April 30 , 20@@ 26 .
until September this year , however , it would only be possible to take stock of the survey , in the context of those involved in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area , to fill out a questionnaire .
in November or December , the decree may take place as far as possible , so that in the coming year it can begin with the re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ings .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann then explained that each commun@@ e must carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations .
the aim is to evaluate the urban development and to decide when it will be renovated and to what extent .
there will also be a re@@ mark in the land register for the respective plot .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again to sensi@@ tivities and make a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ tw@@ ald emphas@@ ised that a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Building and Land sl@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which it is concerned , among other things , about the structural condition and the views of the renovation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ous@@ ehold and H@@ ousing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; information about size , division and residents of a living room can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the blue &quot; operation bow &quot; can only be filled if premises are operated in the building .
however , Got@@ zel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , new construction measures are not eligible for funding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ in@@ dler emphasized that the distribution of funds according to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works - who comes first , gr@@ ind first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no funding can be made for later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally pictures of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local nucle@@ us II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the participants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or puts himself a micro@@ chip to come home and car with a hand movement
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology by its company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has partner@@ ed with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory An@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards .
the technology is similar to a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra charge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now installed both at home and in his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ er thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a nav@@ al helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military entrusted to the TI@@ ME magazine up to $ 24@@ ,000 .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
the helicopter made in Connec@@ tic@@ ut was exhibited in addition to a ma@@ ine yacht , a Wisconsin fire@@ fighter and a forklift from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the White House military bure@@ au required the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event of high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event , the deputy nav@@ y commander for aviation .
the message showed that the helicopter arrived on the South La@@ wn on July 17th at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning and stayed until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on that evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew would be required for the return flight .
the original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the safety personnel of the unit stayed on the ground during the time on the aircraft .
from the records provided by the TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was required .
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could viol@@ ate the appointment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the command@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds like you &apos;re locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as the official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an imp@@ etus for the reform of the health reform that was going on in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but to request their use only for a photo op is unusual .
in February , Tr@@ ump carried out an investigation when the presidential aircraft acted against the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of news that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential jet by its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 countries that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Assistant Secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often perform training flights in the Washington area and in the South La@@ wn to dep@@ ose the US president at the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
as a tr@@ ump at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 in the White House led 58 practice land@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted on the training needs of the flight crew for the month , an officer said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; hel@@ pl@@ aid units also flew eleven hours this day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers took the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man for Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company had not been involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget labels for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the deployment of the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour .
unit Records list the flight time of the plane as 30 minutes from the home base of the Navy Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in annual means . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but also take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract .
at that time the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present this week things made in America , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for whom so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
it is of course appropriate to highlight this . &quot;
it was not clear if Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting with the helicopter when he entered his tour across the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine car .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tri@@ cky task
leader of the Second World Tennis Championships comes to the stand@@ ings of the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
the TC Blue @-@ White Ne@@ uss will start tomorrow from 11@@ am in Kiel in the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
despite five games still flaw@@ less balance , the leader in the Second Tennis Championships got the sense of reality .
team principal Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially in the rear positions I find the team very good . &quot;
the imports from the high North are primarily concerned with class and stability at the S@@ V Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to applications in the Davis Cup .
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view to Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ anus ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is as always difficult for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good portion of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser crew for the trip to the high North is convenient .
his debut for blue wh@@ ites could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ ine .
if the Fren@@ ch@@ man who is currently still active at the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fren@@ ch@@ man does not succeed in the Bundes@@ liga match , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) , playing in the Czech Liber@@ ec in the Czech Republic , comes first in this season .
the previously un@@ defeated Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ li@@ nik @-@ Cas@@ tillo was with the white @-@ rus@@ sen An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski still at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
he should also be present in Kiel as well as Bo@@ tic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two wins the last Sunday against the Club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ cus could join the team again .
it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary who was the number one of the junior world rank@@ ings in January 2016 , and does not fill up the cad@@ re from the trainer around Mari@@ us Z@@ ay .
how America can harm the O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump did not really happy when he put his signature under the law on the tigh@@ tening of sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress packed a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he corro@@ bor@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ stered the U.S. advance .
after all , the draft intends to punish European companies that are helping the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU .
since then , investors from the O@@ MV , who jointly with other European companies have co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea Release North Stream 2 .
the dr@@ one backdrop is huge .
nevertheless , it is too early to estimate the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump herself would have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order .
there are twelve weapons to choose from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has looked upon which of the Group could rep@@ el and which really could hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Rel@@ ay 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is centered on the hit series by Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar killer reveals , the Net@@ fli@@ x series is not over yet .
the three and four seasons were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest vil@@ la@@ ins of the show .
with the third season , the DE@@ A has directed its attention to the rich@@ est organisation of drug traffi@@ cking in the world : the cal@@ i cart@@ el .
&quot; &quot; &quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only with more state bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez O@@ re@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez O@@ re@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican compound , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York .

roll back : the town has 46 kitchen aids
the city organis@@ es the lunch table by itself .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
the clock is turned back in the city &apos;s day@@ care centers .
the City of Kre@@ feld will take over food supplies in the municipal kinder@@ garten facilities ( Kit@@ as ) as of September 1st .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cook continues to cook in addition to the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and provides fresh fermentation .
the city operates in the Kre@@ feld area 46 day@@ care centers , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunch time .
last year saw 28@@ 00 children sitting at the tables and the demand is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who are cared for in 45 hours of week eat at the K@@ ita at noon , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pom@@ mer@@ dance explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid for 35 @-@ hour assistance if children remain until 14 : 00 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 partial @-@ time staff have kitchen service starting on 1 September : they heat up the delivered meals , supplement them with salad , raw vegetables and fruit , divide the meal individually , clean the food , clean and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the workers are assigned to a k@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pom@@ mer@@ gency says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as group@@ ed units - decide on the timet@@ able .
&quot; the kitchen assistants now belong firmly to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the genital @-@ management to implement ped@@ ago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because it is also about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children should help prepare the food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen staff to the team makes sense .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a known force in the ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
cleaning of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning personnel in the future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance also has the charm that it has presented itself in the cost comparison between self @-@ control and foreign assignment for the city as the most economical one , it is from the press office .
and this , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re@@ configured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so heavy with around 750 people in education , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on women &apos;s political role , says the UN
elections can only be representative when all members of society , including women , play a role , said the Chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , acting leader of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women will be chann@@ eling in the coun@@ cils in the provinces . three women candidates for the role of the vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women &apos;s role cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elections can only be really representative and credible if women participate fully and be involved in all parts of the choice process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on April 5 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tali@@ ban has published threats against a choice process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international combat actions to an advisory role . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year elections for the first time will be transferred peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ den said a strong role for women will reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an independent electoral commission reports that 1.2 million women from a total of 3,@@ 6 million registered voters were registered .

men are trying to eradic@@ ate 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried on Thursday to ro@@ b a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
according to the police , the men of the 13 @-@ year @-@ old spoke with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ strasse against 14.@@ 55 P.@@ M. Because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s mobile phone .
but the 13 @-@ year @-@ old declined the request and went on with her friends .
as a result , one of the perpetr@@ ators tried to attack the girl &apos;s cell phone and the girl &apos;s necklace , which , however , failed .
without prey , the duo fled .
the two young men could later be arrested by the police .
the investigations are underway .
G@@ MB app@@ reh@@ en@@ sion on investment in the Glasgow Mc@@ Vi@@ tie Factory
a trade union would like to make sure that the long @-@ term commitment to production at its Glasgow work is ensured by managers of the bis@@ que vendor Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company talked about the future of investment at the T@@ oll@@ field site .
more than 500 employees work in the factory , which , in addition to other products , manufactures hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea bis@@ cuits .
Mr Pla@@ dis said he inv@@ ests over 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that workers and trade union representatives would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experience first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the company &apos;s branch manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s call for &quot; express concerns that financing for the modernization of production lines will not be advanced . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we can &apos;t gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ star concerns our members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generations of families have worked here and the workers are concentr@@ ating strongly on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage .
hence , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the Eastern end of Glasgow is urgently needed for a thri@@ ving presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ ywood only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to this because we appreciate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ house where some questions were discussed openly .
we discussed with employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we constantly monitor our business - and this applies to all our business units and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ field site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognize the legacy of T@@ oll@@ re as a production site fully and completely . if our operations change at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did PS@@ G Barcelona have warned of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the side of La League likes to regret their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not indul@@ ge in its persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar after having issued an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to release its release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the world record ?
the sens@@ ational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , because the league 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than twice the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returning to Manchester United for 89 million pounds in the past season .
after the end , N@@ ey@@ mar is becoming the most expensive player in the world and the world &apos;s highest @-@ paying professional ath@@ lete . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way outside , although a source near the Catalan Board insi@@ sts that the club has always tried his best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned against this prospect three years ago by the PS@@ G president ?
when Manchester City in 2014 expressed interest in signing Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any club who wanted to sign one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players .
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we &apos;ll be in opposition to them , we &apos;ll contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , it will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , whereby the Spanish association expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International to leave Italy under any circumstances and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offerings for N@@ ey@@ mar .

the police are looking for witnesses for an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
because a car was coming to meet him in his lane , the driver had to avoid a VW Tour@@ an and tou@@ red the crash barrier .
on Thursday evening the 34 year old from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um with his VW came from Stol@@ zen@@ au to Le@@ ese on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au .
in the area around Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car came to meet him in his lane so that he had to turn right .

according to the accident report , it can be good that the car driver didn &apos;t notice the accident .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report stresses Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report on the Dis@@ ab@@ uses reli@@ eves the pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is what author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann writes .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussion .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement , &quot; We are the Church , &quot; declared a ap@@ ology from the former Regensburg bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as by the cathedral cap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI .
it would serve the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then false estim@@ ation of the processes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the Vatican magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised that in the reporting on violence in the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; double standards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubts that it is a &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful act &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , Hist@@ orian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committee , is striking .
&quot; the habit of den@@ ounc@@ ing the Catholic Church as the source of all ev@@ ils is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it for normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis , too , said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; we are happy to go to the church and that is a fres@@ her . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blows have been a normal educational tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her youth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to deal with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to previous decades , as the world has changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in connection with the reports on the abuse of abuse , pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; totally un@@ justified , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann writes , who wrote with R@@ atz@@ inger the reminder &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the pop@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger into protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ hi , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all that had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the findings of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly stands in the 440 @-@ page report presented by Mr. Ulrich Weber who was appointed by the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg ?
between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; were victims of assault , 67 dom@@ es of dom@@ es sexually ab@@ used .
in the final report it is called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that Master &apos;s master R. was used in many cases of physical and psychological violence .
especially in the case of high emotional quality , the punishment for the students was even more severe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to many other accused , many victims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; valued &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even consider positive memories with him in many cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an interview , E@@ zek@@ ier explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is reli@@ eved of his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incidents of violent exercise in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; is a contradic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one , many students highlight his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , it also appears as a cler@@ k and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which has become pal@@ p@@ able , when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz brought no top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is generally found in it .
he is currently dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly exemp@@ t from any suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pre @-@ school also occurred outside of its sphere of influence .
at best , it is possible to reproach him , to experience it too late , or to have taken first hints not seriously enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asi@@ um , on which he worked , was perceived by virtually all respon@@ dents as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; redemption &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the vast majority of his pupils , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , portra@@ y him as &quot; warm @-@ hear@@ ted , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; profi@@ cient &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher , who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y and &quot; always lag@@ ged &quot; by children &apos;s grapes .
only a minority compl@@ ains about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotion@@ ality , which has also led to qu@@ arri@@ es .
that he not only sk@@ inn@@ ed with chairs and threw the key@@ ring on the ground , but also pulled ear @-@ blades and over@@ looked che@@ ek@@ y guys in the hair or ears , he himself admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ ts and ap@@ olog@@ ised for it .
it must be said , however , that such educational methods were widespread in the period from the 1960s and 1970s , both parents and teachers .
do you still know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state gymn@@ asi@@ um .
compared to what it is about in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence at the pre @-@ school , these are indeed bag@@ at@@ ellen .
one wonders if it does not have to do with his acquain@@ tance and role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media just fell on him .
many people who have never understood him are still working eag@@ erly at the Bavarian Pope .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media , in connection with the report , much talked about the issue of mis@@ use in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger be exposed in the final report also some involvement or co @-@ knowing with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : quite clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have committed himself to the master &apos;s master .
not even the parents were dedicated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of those affected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything was very embarrass@@ ing for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in the clari@@ fication of sexual abuse has been and is , however , that most of the victims are silent .
if they did not even entr@@ ust themselves to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir leader , who would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators professionally .
how do you evaluate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able disciple put it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I don &apos;t see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) would have had timely findings and could have stopped the respective off@@ ender .
I consider it ... even for really absurd to assume that ... Bu@@ ben have opened up more vivi@@ dly and clearly or rather than to their parents , dormit@@ ory managers , trust teachers , etc .
that one talks to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the report concludes with the clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that students and / or their environment affected them in advance could not be confirmed within the scope of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus acqu@@ itted of any co @-@ operation .
nor can he be accused of having prevented him or brought him to the display .
therefore there is no reason to link his good name with these disgu@@ sting crimes , as happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media there was a lot of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former mayor Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking away &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that everything was mixed and mixed in the coverage of a huge range of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is exactly the mis@@ use of the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because it is clean@@ ly separated : between the pre @-@ school and the grammar school of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; between sexual abuse and violence and , let &apos;s say , other accus@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the report treats incidents from the period since 1945 , i.e. also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not choir director of the cathedral @-@ spar@@ rows .
the whole aw@@ ful test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were properly slan@@ ted and mal@@ adjusted , all of them occurred at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions must have reigned .
but with whom Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys only to face when they were already on the domain gymn@@ asi@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that was , as most of the witnesses emphasize , the subject &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pre @-@ school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab@@ oo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one was only happy to escape , and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac &quot; states .
what was different on the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : indeed , there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many victims &quot; valued the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even consider positive memories with him despite violence . &quot;
thus , at most , it remains the reproach to have looked away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which he was reported to him by the conditions at the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and of the events at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( thus the witness ) wanted to hear nothing , and then again around 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently shut the ears in front of the conditions ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 , he wrote a letter to the director of the Cathedral gymn@@ asi@@ um , which the report even reproduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he pointed out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the pre @-@ school , the test penalty will continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
already in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as test pen@@ alties were also banned in Bavaria for a long time .
before that , they occurred in a legal grey area , as each of us knows still .
it was difficult for him to estimate where the affected people might exagger@@ ate or dram@@ ati@@ ze and where the permitted limit has actually been exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he always looked away .
that just isn &apos;t true .
only in 1980 the test penalty for schools was officially aboli@@ shed in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis maintained that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ ago@@ gical standards to that time .
how do you see that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pit@@ fall of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; meaning the danger of ass@@ essing the past according to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess was right there .
but of course this does not apply to sexual abuse , which at all times was abom@@ in@@ able and also not for what was broken in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond that then practice .
this is all very horri@@ ble and I am glad that it will finally be worked out .
but at the same time I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger into protection , for all that had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ishing , that is , to drag ear @-@ blades and to the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
as a physical punishment , it was strictly forbidden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; which picture from his Regensburg times did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger play in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the pop@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the subject matter of testing also come to the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells from his perspective , because the dom@@ es only played a minor role .
nevertheless , I did not at all give away that he had a strict regi@@ ment there .
but this too must be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form a world @-@ tran@@ g institution , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y you alone don &apos;t make a big singer out of rebel@@ li@@ ous boys and stand before every success , regardless of which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of person did you see when Georg R@@ atz@@ inger lived in the talks with her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and in addition , I really got to know Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful , humor@@ ous , ground@@ less , deeply faithful and heart @-@ good people , from which one can &apos;t imagine that he could also do something like a fly .
I regularly get in touch with him , like many former dom@@ ites , 23 years after his exp@@ ir@@ ation , visit him regularly , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family .
those who have not forgiven him until today , that he was once strict with them , are clearly in the minority .
most dom@@ es are grateful to him today for enrich@@ ing their lives and bringing the world of music to them .
and that he is always a good , fa@@ ther@@ ly teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but it was also a lovely respect@@ ful person to which they still look up and rever@@ e them .
and please , once again quite clearly : all that is accused of him are educational methods that were on the order of the day .
we can be happy that we have long overcome this time .
but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to become a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
the evil intent that stands behind is all too obvious .
the report , which was just published , reli@@ eves him .
now the uph@@ eav@@ al would command , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man , who acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
